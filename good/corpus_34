It might be because you have a fixed mindset, as opposed to a growth mindset.

Credit goes to Carol Dweck for the research on the two mindsets. Check out her book "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" if you want to read more about this.

This is the difference between the two mindsets when it comes to social interaction...

Growth mindset: I *said something* awkward.

Fixed mindset: I *am* awkward.

Someone with a fixed mindset believes that "who I am" is static. They believe that they can't change it in any meaningful way. Their successes and their failures simply **confirm** who they are.

Someone with a growth mindset believes that "who I am" can be developed, and every failure is an opportunity to learn. Their successes and their failures are **separate** from who they are.

With a fixed mindset, every social interaction becomes an evaluation and confirmation of "who I am". When you say something awkward you take it as proof that you are mediocre. Because of this you avoid challenges like expressing yourself or sharing your personal opinion... since these challenges are difficult and are likely to expose your flaws. You prefer to succeed at easy tasks, like staying quiet, because it lets you avoid failure.

With a growth mindset, every social interaction is an opportunity to improve. Saying something awkward is simply an indication that you need to put more effort into that area. It is not a sign of failure or a reflection of "who I am".

The trick to accepting yourself is to see your **behaviours** as something separate to your **self**.

If a child says something impressive you would cultivate a **fixed** mindset (the bad one) if you told them "You are a smart boy/girl". What you are doing by saying this is connecting *what they did* to *who they are*. This child then learns to fear difficult challenges because failing the challenge means that they *are* a failure.

You can cultivate a **growth** mindset instead (the good one) by telling them "You did a good job". You are no longer connecting *what they did* to *who they are*. The feedback is only about *what they did*. They learn to enjoy failure and see it as a necessary step towards improvement.

It might be helpful if you change your own inner dialogue. Forget "who I am" and focus instead on "what I did".

Maybe keep a rubber band on your wrist and then change wrists every time you catch yourself feeling uncomfortable with "who I am". Think about "what you did" instead, and what you could do differently.

Eg. You say something awkward in a conversation. Then you catch yourself thinking "I'm awkward."

Think instead: "I said something awkward. What can I say next time to be less awkward?"

It's okay. Laugh about it.

It's a free 10-minute guide that tells you what to say, how to say it and why it makes a difference.

Over time you will find it easier to share your opinion and express yourself because your behaviour will no longer be tied to your opinion of yourself.
