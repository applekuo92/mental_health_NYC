I see fear pop up over and over among a lot of the famous people I respect the most.  This just seemed super relevant in light of recent events.

Nietzche says the reason we listen to fear is because it (paraphrasing) speaks so loudly inside our head.  We essentially do what it tells us before we realize we have the option not to.  Many other people have great things to say on the subject (and I'd love to hear everyone's take on it).  But so many of these people, despite agreeing on the seeming necessity to not fear *fear* itself (like Roosevelt said so well), disagree on how to go about this.  Some seem to meet it head on, some try to deflect and others seem to try and use it to their advantage.

Just thought it seemed like a good time to discuss fear and how we experience it in light of what is, n my opinion, one of the greatest in the world at working with his fear.  I'd love to hear anyone else's take on fear and how you integrate it into your life, great quotes, or just anything else by the Champ that really helps drive you.
