This is as close as I can get to verbatim. Been repeating it on the drive home. 

"I used to think I was the metal, God was a blacksmith, and life was fire; that the hammer was going to shape me into the tool I need to be. Then shit hit the fan. I saw that I held the hammer, my life was the metal, and my circumstances were the fire. Once life turns up the heat, it's up to you to hit the anvil or lose your temper."
