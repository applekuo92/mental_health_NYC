Stay Strong, Your Time Will Come !
Kenya is 2 hrs ahead of Nigeria, but it does not mean that Nigeria is slow, or that Kenya is fast. Both countries are working based on their own "Time Zone."
Some one is still single.. Someone got married and 'waited' 10 yrs before having a child, there is another who had a baby within a year of marriage.
Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a good job; and there is another who graduated at 27 and secured employment immediately!
Someone became CEO at 25 and died at 50 while another became a CEO at 50 and lived to 90 years.
Everyone works based on their 'Time Zone' People can have things worked out only according to their pace. Work in your “time zone”.
Your Colleagues, friends, younger ones might "seem" to go ahead of you.
Don't envy them, it's their 'Time Zone.' You are in yours!
Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself. All things shall work together for your good. You’re not late … you’re very much On time!
