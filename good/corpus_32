I got a season pass, and I realized I was too big for 2 of my favorite rides. I was really upset and I decided that I was going to fit on the rides the next time I went. So I went to the gym everyday, ate a lot less, and after two weeks and 10 pounds I went back to sixflags yesterday. I fit on EVERY ride. I just wanted to share my achievement!
