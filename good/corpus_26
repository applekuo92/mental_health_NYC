You might be sitting there right now with nothing, I've been there and so have so many others, you feel hopeless you feel worthless and there might not even be anything to live for anymore. I'm scared of the person I was when I had nothing because I would have done anything just to have something. You're not weak because you have nothing you're strong because you're willing to do anything it takes. 

This is the greatest time to be alive. Get what you deserve.
