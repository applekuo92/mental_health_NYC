[How to stop screwing yourself over | Mel Robbins | TEDxSF] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp7E973zozc)

I found this to be very insightful because it can apply to any idea you have whether it's trying to get a particular job, lose 30 pounds, or find the love of your life. If you think about it, it's quite simple (but not easy) :)

EDITED: Had no idea this would blow up, honestly. I have been away from the keyboard trying to get my Shakespeare reading in for next class *yay*. A big thanks to Mel Robbins for commenting on this post!

EDITED #2: I really do appreciate everyone's comments and conversations. It seems that everyone has a little different take on the video which I find to be quite interesting and informative. Once again, cheers
