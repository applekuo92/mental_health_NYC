He said this at a commencement speech which had went viral on YouTube years ago. In this speech he had also discussed writing himself a check for $10,000,000 and then cashing that same check five years later after the release of Dumb and Dumber.

     This is a man, just like ALL of you, who had a dream. He accomplished his, though, due to believing, grinding and sacrificing every single day.

     Pain, sacrifice, time and effort. These are all things neccessarry and absolute to accomplish those dreams we seek to make a reality in our life. Never doubt who you are or the boundless potential you carry as an individual. You are you and you are awesome.
