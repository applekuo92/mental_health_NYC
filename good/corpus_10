"**Life Advice: I am in my late 20s, and feel I have wasted a lot of time. Is it too late?**" ([source](http://www.quora.com/Life-Advice/I-am-in-my-late-20s-and-feel-I-have-wasted-a-lot-of-time-Is-it-too-late#ans1957907))

> Too late for what? 
> 
> If you slept through your 26th birthday, it's too late for you to experience that. It's too late for you to watch "LOST" in its premiere broadcast. (Though, honestly, you didn't miss much.) It's too late for you to fight in the Vietnam War. It's too late for you to go through puberty or attend nursery school. It's too late for you to learn a second language as proficiently as a native speaker. It's probably too late for you to be breastfed. 
> 
> It's not too late for you to fall in love. 
> 
> It's not too late for you to have kids.
> 
> It's not too late for you to embark on an exciting career or series of careers. 
> 
> It's not too late for you to read the complete works of Shakespeare; learn how to program computers; learn to dance; travel around the world; go to therapy; become an accomplished cook; sky dive; develop an appreciation for jazz; write a novel; get an advanced degree; save for your old age; read "In Search of Lost Time"; become a Christian, then an atheist, then a Scientologist; break a few bones; learn how to fix a toilet; develop a six-pack ...

> Honestly, I'm 47, and I'll say this to you, whippersnapper: you're a fucking kid, so get over yourself. I'm a fucking kid, too. I'm almost twice your age, and I'm just getting started! My dad is in his 80s, and he wrote two books last year.

> You don't get to use age as an excuse. Get off your ass!

> Also, learn about what economists call "sunk costs." If I give someone $100 on Monday, and he spends $50 on candy, he'll probably regret that purchase on Tuesday. In a way, he'll still think of himself as a guy with $100â€”half of which is wasted. 
> 
> What he really is is a guy with $50, just as he would be if I'd handed him a fifty-dollar bill. A sunk cost from yesterday should not be part of today's equation. What he should be thinking is this: "What should I do with my $50?"

> What you are isn't a person who has wasted 27 years. You are a person who has X number of years ahead of you. What are you going to do with them?
