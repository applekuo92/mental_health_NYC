He dropped that bomb on me during Kung Fu Panda 3 today. 

It made me reflect on my journey as a business man. Every single opportunity that came my way has started with someone asking me, "Can you do this?" 

The true answer was, "I don't know, but I will try." 

The answer I gave every time: "Yes!"

The life lesson: If you know how to do it 80% of the way, then you can figure it out. Don't sell yourself short or shy away from opportunities because you don't know everything!
