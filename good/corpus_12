I saw this quote today on a TIL post. It really struck me as an important thing to think about in all aspects of our lives.

In the original post, Stanley Kubrick delays writing a letter to his idol trying to perfect it and his idol unfortunately passes before he can reach him.

For me, this quote really pushes me to make healthier changes in all aspects of my life. If I don't do it now, my physical and mental health will only get worse and I don't want to be fat and unhappy for the rest of my life.

Shoutout to u/hardboil3d for posting this quote on TIL
