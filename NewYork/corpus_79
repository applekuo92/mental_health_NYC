I'm looking for a cheap place north of the city. I work there twice a week but travel extensively and want a very remote place that's easy to hold onto when I'm out and around the world.

I don't know upstate all that well. I've been exploring Carmel a few times and love it.

Is it possible to rent a house, or do they need to be bought? Are there cheap fixer-uppers out there that need to be filled? I've been living in apartments my whole life so I'm not sure how it works. 

Your input is obliged!
