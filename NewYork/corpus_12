If you go to /r/askscience and hover your mouse over the "Ask a science question" button a text box pops up and reminds people to read  and comply with their rules. 

I would like to see something similar in this sub. It should remind people that this is a discussion forum for the State of New York and refer them to /r/nyc or /r/AskNYC for city only content and questions.

Do other members here think this would be a good idea? I don't want an upstate/downstate argument here. I love NYC. I love Upstate. I love the North Country and WNY. I'm just tired of threads like:

Mods, if you decide to look into this,[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/1qenbz/new_to_css_i_like_the_post_submission_button_in/) is a discussion I found about the askscience css script. Hopefully it can help.


Also, Our sidebar text is a copy of the first paragraph of the [New York State Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_york). I think it could be improved too.
