According to [Opencongress.org](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3261/show), both Senators Schumer AND Gillibrand are co-sponsors of SOPA, and have both received GIGANTIC piles of money to support it.  Contacting both of them would take only minutes, and I don't think that is a huge price to pay considering how destructive this bill would be.
