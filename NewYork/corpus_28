Please help. My older brother ran away from home (Massachusetts) on the morning of March 19. I heard a rumor that he could be in New York. This is the on,y picture of him I have [reddit!]http://imgur.com/ZxEwZQI . He's seventeen now, and has contacts. Other than that, he looks very similar. His name is Josh and we have no way of contacting him. This might be the wrong place, but I would just really like my brother back home and safe. Please PM me if you can find anything.

Edit: Brother has been found! He says he is okay but isn't coming home. Thank you to those who tried!
Edit2: Brother is home safe!
