Information from /u/Atomfest:

> Now that the election has been certified, New Yorkers who believe they genuinely should've been registered Democrats and cast provisional ballots have 20 days under New York state statute (can't remember the exact number) to see the evidence explaining why their vote wasn't counted and to go before a judge to challenge it. NYC voters - the board of elections it's doing the legwork for you in their investigation into the purges, but those not in NYC will have a tougher time of it.

> They're required to send a letter stating why your vote wasn't counted, but with so many affidavit ballots it's likely many won't arrive within the 20 days, so concerned voters should be proactive.

> If you want more information about what you can do, look into the Election Justice USA lawsuit and website. They should have information on there as to what the law says and how you can try to get your vote counted.

> To be clear, this will only help people who should've been registered Democrats, but were purged or not on the rolls for some reason. Independents who cast provisional ballots won't see any benefit from the statute and very likely none from the lawsuit either.

> edit: the statute is 16-106 and there's an informative interview with a lawyer working with Election Justice USA here: https://youtu.be/Rg1Xw70e9F8

> > § 16-106. Proceedings as to the casting and canvass of ballots

> > 1. The casting or canvassing or refusal to cast challenged ballots, blank ballots, void or canvass absentee, military, spe­cial federal, federal write-in or emergency ballots and ballots voted in affidavit envelopes by persons whose registration poll records were not in the ledger or whose names were not on the computer generated registration list on the day of election or voters in inactive status, voters who moved to a new address in the city or county or after they registered or voters who claimed to be enrolled in a party other than that shown on their registration poll record or on the computer generated registration list and the original applications for a military, special federal, federal write-in, emergency or absentee voter’s ballot may be contested in a proceeding instituted in the supreme or county court, by any candidate or the chairman of any party committee, and by any voter with respect to the refusal to cast such voter’s ballot, against the board of canvass­ers of the returns from such district, if any, and otherwise against the board of inspectors of election of such district. If the court determines that the person who cast such ballot was entitled to vote at such election, it shall order such ballot to be cast and canvassed if the court finds that ministerial error by the board of elections or any of its employees caused such ballot envelope not to be valid on its face.

> > 2. The canvass of returns by the state, or county, city, town or village board of canvassers may be contested, in a proceed­ing instituted in the supreme court by any voter, except a proceeding on account of the failure of the state board of canvassers to act upon new returns of a board of canvassers of any county made pursuant to the order of a court or justice, which may be instituted only by a candidate aggrieved or a voter in the county.

> > 3. The attorney general, on behalf of the state, and the chairman of the state committee of a party, may institute any proceeding allowed herein relating to the returns of canvass by inspectors upon the vote of any ballot proposal submitted to the people of the state.

> > 4. The court may direct a recanvass or the correction of an error, or the performance of any duty imposed by law on such a state, county, city, town or village board of inspectors, or canvassers.

> > 5. A proceeding under subdivisions one and three of this section must be instituted within twenty days and under subdi­vision two, within thirty days after the election or alleged erroneous statement or determination was made, or the time when the board shall have acted in the particulars as to which it is claimed to have failed to perform its duty, except that such a proceeding with respect to a village election must be institut­ed within ten days after such election, statement, determina­tion or action.

> > (L.1976, c. 233, § 1. Amended L.1982, c. 647, § 27; L.1989, c. 359, § 29; L.1992, c. 91, § 12; L.1994, c. 659, § 52.)
