If a student misses an exam because a documented medical reason, can the school refuse to give them a make-up exam? Especially if they have proof they were in the hospital or something?
Legally, they have to give make-ups for religious reasons, but my boyfriend is trying to find a law about medical absences. Any ideas?

I also tried posting in r/highereducation but I thought it might be state specific. If anyone has any other suggestions where to post it it, I'll take it. Thanks!
