I'm a rising high school senior headed to Rochester to tour R.I.T.'s campus and then popping over to Troy to tour R.P.I. 

While this could easily be just a two day trip, my family has decided to make it a full week vacation. We have time to go anywhere (as RIT and RPI are practically on opposite sides of the state) and were looking for things to see or do.

Two points:

* I don't want to go to New York City. I understand that it would be a wonderful time, but I want to save that for it's own separate escapade. 
* I especially like museums and interesting places. While fascinating restaurants, site seeing, etc. are not out of the question, I would really like to see a cool museum or a historical monument. 

A big thank you to anyone who responds! Hope to see you guys soon!


Edit: Thanks, guys! This looks like a really good list. Based on these suggestions, we'll probably be touring Buffalo and hitting Ithaca on the way up.
