Hi /r/NewYork

For some of us, tomorrow is going to be an awful day. I personally will be staying off of most kinds of media as I can't handle watching or hearing any of the footage from that day. I saw it all once and that was more than enough. 

I remember my high school going on lockdown as we watched our world end. We watched the smoke blacken the sky 40 miles away from the 3rd floor of the building. We wondered about our families and the families of our friends. We watched the news in our senior class's hang out room where we ran pirated Cable from the library. We watched as the second plane hit. We remember all too well. 

Tomorrow always hurts. For many it'll hurt far more than it does for me. 

We remember because we can never forget that trauma. We are thankful for those who risked and gave their lives. We support those who still suffer and we mourn the world that day brought us into. 

I felt a need to write something. 15 years later witnessing footage of that day tears at my soul. If anyone else needs to talk, PM me. 

Peace be with all of you.
