So here is my current situation. I got into this huge arguement with my parents two months ago. Kind of a "You can't tell me what to do!" type argument because I turned 18 and wanted out. But despite my strong feelings I let things settle down and waited a month before I acted on anything. I still felt the same way so I told my parents I was leaving and simply left the next day.

For some insight into why I left:

I graduated high school early (when I was 16) because my ambitions were to study biology in college and later go to med school (4 years each not including residency which can range from 2-6 years for a total of like 8-10 years of my life) and I wanted a head start. My parents had other plans for me. They own a business and wanted me to take it over so they didn't allow me to go to college. 

Generally I don't consider myself to be a "smart" person but my ability to learn and adapt are what I think my strong suits are at the moment. Which leads me to the main question I have for you, what would you do if you were in my current situation?

I like to make lists so here are some of my priorities:

* Invest in my education
* Part-time job
* Build my credit
* Rent an apartment/room/something I can live in. 
* Some form of community service (need references for jobs, other things)
* Something with social interaction

I have money saved up and it's enough to get started.

Currently staying with my older sisters friend so I have a place to stay for another month or so.

I feel like a toddler that got lost in walmart. Somewhat helpless and lost and I need a little guidance or a maybe just a kick in the right direction. I have no clue where to start.
