Hi all.  NYC native here who currently works in manufacturing in the Midwest, and looking to return to the area eventually.  I was looking for a list of manufacturing plants or at least companies in the state that have locations but can't seem to find any lists.  Does anyone have such a list or at least ideas of some companies?  If it helps, I'd likely be seeking an engineering role (manufacturing, process, product, project, etc.) or production supervisor.  For example I do know of Kraft in Walton, 3M in Tonawanda, and Kodak of course.  

Thanks!
