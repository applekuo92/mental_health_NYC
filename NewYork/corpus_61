Long time lurker, first time poster.

Having to commute to nyc regularly has me jaded to the sights and sounds of the city. Im looking to explore up state, so dear new york redditors can you suggest off-beaten places to see in new york state (for a dude living across the hudson river) ? Thanks in advance.
