This heat wave in the city is incredibly unbearable. I've lived in the city my whole life, and it never gets any better!

 I have 3 AC'S and 2 fans all over the living room trying to circulate cool air, but it's too damn hot! The only thing circulating is the damn humidity! 

I just took a nap on the couch and woke up soaked, had to take another cold shower just to bring my body temperature back down a bit! I've downed several bottles of cold water, and even sit next to a ziploc bag full of ice, and not even that works :(

Can't go outside cause it's even worse out there, but my goodness. How do you guys deal with this heat? I'd love to hear some interesting stories :)
