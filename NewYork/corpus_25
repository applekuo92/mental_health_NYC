I am the father of a six year old whose life is getting lost in a trileptal and depicote haze, and which has done little to nothing to effect his near hourly atonic seizures and near daily tonic seizures. I am not saying that MMJ will elevate his seizures but after seeing all the anecdotal reports I would at least like to try. I doubt he will be any worse than the depecote fog he walks around in all day anyway.

After mentioning the idea to his neurologist he kindly wrote it off essentially saying the jury is not out yet. Plus there is a lot of work involved for him to even prescribe it so I am sure he is not too keen on that. (If you know of a neurologist that is certified to prescribe MMJ in NYS or is at least interested please let me know. We live a train ride away from NYC.)

If you have the time please read these regulations and if you care please leave a comment. From what I can see these regulations are going to restrict care to those who need it more than any amount of abuse they might curtail.
