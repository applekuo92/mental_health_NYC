I had an ez-pass in my car and every 4th exit or so it wouldn't register, so I'd get a huge charge and have to dispute it. I was sick of it, so I called to cancel about 2 years ago and they told me, "Oh, that's because you have an older style pass, we'll send you a brand new one". I still get maybe every 6th pass through an exit or so not registering.

To make it worse, their website is a humongous pain to use, and trying to call someone on the phone is no ez-task.

Is it just me? Or, have others had trouble with ez-passes? I love the convenience while on the road, but later, the inconvenience of dealing with the bullcrap of using their site and disputing charges is infuriating.

If it's just me, I'll have to figure out what I'm doing wrong and fix it, but if others have similar problems, I'm gonna be done with it altogether.
