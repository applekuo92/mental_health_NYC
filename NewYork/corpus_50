I'm not from NY but when ever I watch movie or tv series that base in NY there will always be scaffolding every where, seem like there's always unfinished construction going on around the city. I don't remember seeing these in other cities (in the movies). Now when ever I see these scaffolding in movie or show I immediately think this is NYC. 

Is it really like this over there ? are they building thing along the side walk everywhere at all time ?
