Hey,

I'm going to be coming to New York next month for an interview with a tech company. My wife and small child will accompany me for the weekend, and we want to scope out Manhattan. We would want to live somewhere on Manhattan island, and want to get a good idea of the best place to live for families with younger children. Right now we live in downtown Toronto near an area that is filled with families, with plenty of playgrounds and things for kids to do. Is there an equivalent for this in Manhattan, or a few to choose from?

We'd love to stay near those areas, or at least visit them while we are there for the weekend.

Thanks for the help!
