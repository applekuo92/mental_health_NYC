My roommate, a co-worker (we release music, curate events, and DJ together), and friend is younger than I am (I'm 27, he's 20).  He's a good guy and a good roommate, tho obviously a smidgeon immature at times (but he's 20 so yknow no biggie).  

I've spent the last 2 months trying to secure an apartment.  His parents would be guarantors as my credit is not stellar.  

You guys know how it is; you look at a million places.  First place we found that we liked, the LL cancelled on us as I was walking over w/deposit after a week of organizing.

And last night, my roommate dropped out of our second place, saying he couldn't ACTUALLY do all the things he said he'd be able to do, and his parents didn't want to co-sign after all, and "my bad".  

I'm so frustrated, but more than that, I'm scared.  I've been homeless once before, very briefly, in my life; sleeping in the park and so forth.  It wasn't fun.  

I'm responsible, gainfully employed, friendly, smart, helpful...dare I say even a GGG?  

I would love to find a fellow redditor as a roomie, or someone that can sublet to me, or both (i'm looking for a mid-december or January 1st move in).  without these guarantors and another roomie to halve the rent costs I'm at a bit of a loss and just plain scared.  

Any help would be very much appreciated.  Thank you for reading. b
