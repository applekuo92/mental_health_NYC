I am from louisville, Kentucky. My brother is leaving the to go join the airforce august 18. We want to do a week long road trip up to New York. We like the outdoors and can only camp along the way because our budget is only $1000. We are not interested in New York City but more around finger lakes. We want to go fishing for salmon and just see the beauty of the state. Where are good places to fish salmon and what are some cool places to visit near the south western part of the state. Thanks
