It's nearly impossible to read through a thread here without seeing a newbie assume that /r/NewYork is /r/NYC *and also* a regular user showing animosity to all things that relate to NYC.  

At the end of the day, no one is actually happy with the arrangement.  Why not create a new subreddit IE /r/UpsateNY that addresses exclusively things that relate to Upstate NY and use /r/NewYork to make the user proactively pick between the two?

The newbies won't stop because they're newbies.  As soon as we teach one, the next one comes along.  And the resentment probably won't stop either.  So why not just fix it?
