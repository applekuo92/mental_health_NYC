Hi,

 My name is Holly and I am a student from the University of Stirling in Scotland. I am in my final year at university and am studying Environmental Science and have a particular interest in Natural Disasters.  As part of my final year at university I  am undertaking a dissertation project and have decided to base mine in the area of  natural disasters and in this case, Hurricane Sandy. I dedicated part of my summer to my dissertation research by coming to New York and exploring the affects Sandy had on different communities within New York and New Jersey. I am interested in looking a the differences in planning and preparation and stages of recovery within the areas of New York and New Jersey. I gathered a lot of useful information during my time there but would still love to collect more information. I have made a questionnaire and would be most grateful if you would like to fill it out and share some of your experiences from Hurricane Sandy. Feel free to pass on my questionnaire to anybody you think would like to fill it out. 

You can find my questionnaire by clicking the link below.
