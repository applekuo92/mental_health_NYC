Hey there, I'm driving to New York with a few friends however we have nowhere to sleep. Is it legal to sleep at Walmart's parking lot? We're thinking the following two:


- one on Teterboro Landing Drive next to airport
- or the other at 2100 88th Street, NB

There's 3 of us and we're driving rented small car if that matters, all of us foreigners. 

No money for motel.

Also would it be legal to keep the car at Walmart's parking lot through the day while we are going through NY?

Thank you!
