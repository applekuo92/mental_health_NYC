Hey guys, I'll be going to New York state to work in the summer (I'm an 18 year old British student at the minute, 19 by the summer), and I had a few questions.

- What's the climate kind of like? I'll be heading out towards the Hamptons, and was wondering what the average temperature would be like. 

- Is the sea hot? I'll be by the coast, and was wondering whether it'd be hot?

- Are there main chain shops/restaurants in the Hampton area? Is food expensive (relative to the rest of America)?

- How much is a train ticket from NYC to the Hamptons area? Are the trains regular? 

-Final question (not related to NY but hey ho) what are the cheap airlines to fly across to the West Coast? Once I finished my job, I get to do some travelling at the end of it, and would like to go to Cali and was wondering who were the budget airlines in the US.

Thanks!
