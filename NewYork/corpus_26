Born and raised in NYC, but I've started to get a little sick of city life. Considering relocating in the next couple years. I've considered somewhere upstate so I'm still close to the family, but I've spent little time up there, and I'm sure its very different depending on where you are specifically. My question to you guys, whats your favorite part of Upstate NY? Whats out there that you cant have in NYC? Worst parts about living there?
