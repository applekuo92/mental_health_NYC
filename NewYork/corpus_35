I found it today, February 27th on the PATH train from 14th Street to JSQ at around 7:50 PM. I saw the crowd of people walk on and then noticed a DS holder with a giant pokeball on it, it looks new so I assumed the owner got it at the Nintendo store today. Before I could get anyone's attention the train left. If you lost it, or know someone who lost it today PLEASE contact me! I like in Hoboken but I would gladly mail it back to its rightful owner!

EDIT]:The owner has been contacted, thank you for the people who told me to check the friend code. Through this I found her tumblr where she has it posted. The tumblr has the same name as the Nintendo account and I have messaged her to arrange a return! Thank you so much for your help Reddit!
