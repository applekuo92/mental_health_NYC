I am a grad student and I was recently diagnosed with  depression and anxiety disorder. I was at the lowest point at my life and my parents suggested me to travel somewhere and take some time off studies. Decided to travel to NYC and wow, what an experience. This city is a gem. So diverse, so very inspiring. The city has had its ups and downs but one thing this city has in bundles is its never give up attitude and Inspiration in each of its people. To NYC, thank you for cheering me up this new year. Never change and continue to be this city of inspiration. 

Much love and a Happy New Year.
