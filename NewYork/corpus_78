I'm from California, moved to Tennessee. I can't get a new license here because I was flagged has having trouble with the DMV in New York. The only time I was in New York I was travelling by Amtrak and I didn't have any license at the time.

Calling the Driver Improvement Unit 5184740774 hasn't helped. 

All advice greatly appreciated. Thank you.

**Update**: Got help. Faxed the following to the DIU at FAX (518) 474-6208 :

Contact info
Last four digits of my social
Scanned copy of my driver's license
Residency for the last 10 years

and I added a little blurb of the situation and whom I was able to talk to. It's still not cleared up but I was able to get somebody on the line and they told me they'll look into it and when to call back. Hopefully this'll all be taken care of and I'll be able to get my new license.
