I am moving from Florida to New York soon and I have no idea what I'm doing. I bought an ultra warm puffy down parka from LL Bean and some sorrel snow boots. I've heard that I need a fleece jacket and wool socks and leather gloves for driving. What else do I need to invest in other than layers, sweaters, thermals, and hats/scarves/gloves? 


My car has all season tires and I've heard those are okay and that no one really uses snow tires. Do I need to do anything to winterizing my car other than getting heavier oil and low temp wiper fluid? 


Any tips are much appreciated.
