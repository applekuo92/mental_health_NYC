I went to boarding school about an hour north of the city in the 90's.  A ton of my classmates were either from or spent a ton of time in the city and it was like a lawless no-man's land.

Drugs were easily accessible, you could get into (almost) any bar or nightclub if you could pass for 18, and porn and hookers were everywhere.

Obviously, most of the porn is gone thanks to Guliani (and the internet), but do kids in NYC still have that kind of free reign they did back in the 90's?
