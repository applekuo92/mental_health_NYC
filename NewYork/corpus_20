Hi r/newyork,

My name is Sean Kim and my best friend, Lionel, was diagnosed with 2nd stage Lymphoma last year. He managed to beat his cancer, but not for long: His cancer returned a few months ago, and he is in need of a stem cell transplant for his bone marrow.

I can't believe I'm asking so much of you guys, but please, if you are willing to see if you're a match, come to Great Neck to save a life.
