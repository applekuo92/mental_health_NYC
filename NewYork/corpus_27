I'm not sure if this has been discussed before -- I didn't see anything in a quick history search -- but it seems like at least half the posts in here are about NYC and all of the comments are "check r/nyc." 

I don't know the logisitics or anything, but maybe we could move to r/newyorkstate or anything better that you guys can think of.
