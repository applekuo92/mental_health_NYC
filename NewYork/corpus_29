Hey /r/newyork.  Today I was informed that my friend Pierce Crowley has disappeared.  He was last seen in White Plains.  More information can be found [here.](http://newrochelle.patch.com/articles/missing-child-pierce-crowley-15-last-seen-in-white-plains)  I would really appreciate if the reddit community and especially /r/newyork could help get him home safely.  He's a good guy.  Thanks everyone!

*Update* It is looking like Pierce left of his own free will and this is a runaway situation.
