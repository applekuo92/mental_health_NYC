My boyfriend and I are celebrating 5 years this August and I'm planning a trip to Upstate NY. I'm completely sold because of the amazing list of wineries they have, but I'm getting so overwhelmed!

Can anyone recommend wineries that they've been to and really enjoyed? I'd like to find places that offer tours, wine tasting and food!

Thanks in advance!
