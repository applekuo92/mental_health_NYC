I know that during off-year elections, voter turnout is especially low. It's even lower for primaries. Even though no important positions are up, will anyone vote? I'll be honest, I can't find a single position which is up for election. But since they scheduled a date, something must be on the ballot. Even if its one person running unopposed, it's still something. Voter turnout is the lowest for library elections. Most local libraries have elections for the library budget and library trustees. But I assume you didn't know that. School board elections also have a very low turnout. So, my question is, when did you last vote in a library election, school board election, special election, primary election, or general election? The most recent election I voted in was a school board election in May.
