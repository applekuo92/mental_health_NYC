BUFFALO, N.Y. Authorities believe someone sprayed a 16-week-old Jack Russell Terrier with lighter fluid before setting it on fire.The dog was found on Herman Street on Buffalo's east side by a neighbor. Firefighters wrapped it up in a blanket and brought the puppy ...to the Buffalo Small Animal Hospital around 5:30 p.m. Monday.
Its hair is singed, its lips are swollen, and it struggles to keep its puffy eyes open. Doctors say the next five to seven days will be critical in the dog's recovery.
Dr. Rebecca Wagner, who treated the unnamed puppy, questioned, "How could somebody do this? It's just a terrible, terrible situation. Hopefully he'll make it."
The puppy sat quietly Tuesday. Doctors say he may still be in shock. He's being pumped full of fluids and pain killers after suffering burns all over his body. The dog's ears are "crinkled" according to Dr. Wagner, who said she believes lighter fluid was used to set the puppy ablaze.
"It had a smell to it, an odor to it. And the dog was singed really from head to toe," she said.
The dog has third degree burns across 30 percent of its body. Dr. Wagner says this is one of the worst cases she's seen. But she's hopeful the puppy will pull through and be adopted.
