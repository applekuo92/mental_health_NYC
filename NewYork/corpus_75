Howdy, New Yorkers. (If this subreddit is about NYC, then I apologize and I will post elsewhere.) I live in Eastern Ohio and on browsing Google Maps today, I realized that I am less than four hours from your state, which I have never visited in my life. I was thinking about planning a three-day weekend vacation to the area and I realized that there are three major cities on the Lake Ontario coast that I could visit: Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse.

Now, the obvious choice would be Buffalo, as it's closest and contains the most touristy of touristy places (Niagara Falls), but a) I don't have a passport so I can see the Canadian side, b) crowded,  touristy areas aren't really my thing anyway, and c) Wikipedia makes it sound like another Cleveland or Detroit: mostly post-industrial decay. I want to see the city and do more urban-type things as well as see the natural sites: go to museums and galleries, see landmarks and public works, eat some of the local foods, etc.

So does anybody have any suggestions with regard to these cities? Any input would be appreciated.
