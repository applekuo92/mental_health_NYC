Hey! So I will be driving back to NYC from Toronto this weekend. Since this is a ~9 hour drive, I was hoping to have a midway pitstop where I could spend the night and explore a bit. That said, I know nothing about the upstate NY area and would love some suggestions on where I should go? Syracuse? Albany? Cabin in the woods? Not sure what the possibilities even are. Thanks in advance! :)
