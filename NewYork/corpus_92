Hi there, I'm visiting your lovely city from Australia and would appreciate some advice on tipping. As part of a competition I have won a hair and makeup styling session. The promoter is paying the stylist, and it costs $200 for 1.5 hours of work. In this situation would a tip be expected? Many thanks!
