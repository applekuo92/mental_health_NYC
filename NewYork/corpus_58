So, after "The City" itself, what do you think is the best city in the state?

A few things:

1. Let's not sh*t on any cities we don't particularly like

2. "Best" can be defined however you please... but you have to tell us how you define it. Is it the people? The entertainment? the environment? A big mix? etc.

3. Yes, I know a large megatropolis is not for everyone, and therefore you may feel X is better than NYC, but I just thought it was a clever title. For better or worse, people rarely visit NY state as tourists and don't plan on visiting NYC... so which is the city you would recommend they stay in addition to NYC.
