I saw a recent post here and it reminded me of one of the best kept secrets in New York State.   I'm not sure how many of you visit this subreddit from points outside New York City, but I bet you didn't know that if you live, work or attend school in New York State you are eligible for a New York Public Library card.   The NYPL is the one based in New York City and it is hands down one of the best public libraries anywhere.  If you are a state resident, this entitles you to take books out physically from any NYPL but more importantly it means you can borrow e-books as well.

[Check out the T&C's for the NYPL eligibility here](http://www.nypl.org/help/library-card/terms-conditions#general).

If you live in the 'burbs like I do, you know that smaller, local public library e-book collections kind of suck.   The NYPL's collection, however, seems to have a lot more available.   I've joined it and haven't looked back since.   It's a great resource.

BTW, their [web page](http://www.nypl.org/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nypl) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+newyorkpubliclibrary/posts) pages are great too.
