At the risk of sounding uneducated, I am having a hard time understanding this, what I view as, sudden focus on universal pre-k. Both De Blasio and Cuomo have made this an issue. I don't have kids and I'm not married. When I grew up in NY I went to pre-school and pre-K (they're different right?). I am pretty sure these were at an additional cost to my parents and were privately operated. So why do we need universal pre-k and what is the allure? I'm really trying to understand why this issue is so important. Or is it?
