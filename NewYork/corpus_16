Most people have that one friend that is truly unselfish, always positive and such a joy to be around.  My friend Fidel is that guy. A struggling photographer for the past few years, he just recently landed a new job and needed to find a place somewhat close by so he could make it to work.  A few weeks ago he moved into a new apartment with some 'friends of friends'.  It all started good.....but then one day....after a couple weeks, they literally stole all his stuff, changed the locks and wouldn't let him back in.  They said he couldn't get even one change of clothes (let alone his computer) unless he paid a HUGE amount in the thousands.  He was being extorted.  Police were called but said they couldn't help, it was his word against theirs.

Fast-forward to last week. Former roomies start logging into his social accounts on his computer and start posting bogus and highly derogatory stuff.  THEN this weekend they call his employer and say he's a drug dealer and the workplace is about to get shot up, so his employer (which just hired him two weeks ago) had to let him go due to safety concerns.

He lost his money, his computer, his clothes, his job, his place to live, every photo and video he took/made over the past 5 years, and most likely his will to push on.  All because of these evil f****.  I'm curious if Reddit could somehow help him?  I almost don't know where to turn to myself.....but I really, really want to believe Reddit is the place where you can make a wrong a right, even though I don't know what that really is right now.  He doesn't deserve this.
