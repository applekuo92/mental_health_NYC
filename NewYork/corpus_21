My husband and I are currently looking into Mortgages. And having worked for a major bank in the past as a teller I have a distrust of them. 

Armed with that knowledge I figured that my fellow New York redditors will have some solid knowledge of the local banks and credit unions. 

If any of you have recently gone through this or just done the research I would greatly appreciate the input.
