Hey all,

I know it's not really upstate if you're an hour or two north of Manhattan, but I was just curious if anyone could suggest some good ideas of where to go apple picking outside of NYC (preferably not too far of a drive, near some scenic mountains or something).

I'd like to make a nice day out of it - pick apples, hit a good restaurant, have a nice day with my wife and our parents.

Thanks!
