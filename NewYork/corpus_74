I plan on moving to New York by june 2014 but all my friends and family continue to tell me I wouldn't be able to afford it. Is it really THAT expensive? i mean I don't understand how almost 9 million people can live there, but yet I can't? I'm a freelance photographer and a writer (Yeah how refreshing right? Another artist who wants to move to NYC). I do plan on finding a job as soon as I get there and working my a** off. My brother is also moving with me. So do you think I'll be able to find somewhere to live like in Brooklyn? I'm not by any means delusional enough to think I can afford an apartment in manhattan or anything like that. Where are the reasonably affordable places?Where do Writers and poets, painters and poets live? I don't mind living in a closet size space either. I plan on just crashing/showering/eating at my place anyways. which is pretty much what I already do anyways..

So any advice? Is it really that impossible to move there?
