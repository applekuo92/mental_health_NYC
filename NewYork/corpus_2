So I recently watched AllTime10's video of their creepiest websites and their #1 was about Surveillance Sites. Now, I've seen these before but I usually watch the ones like EarthCam. But upon looking through these cams of one of these sites, I've discovered something disturbing: The security cameras of your kindergartens and daycares are being streamed **live** over the internet for anyone to see.

I recently found [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/3g2z4q/anyone_here_live_in_climax_michigan/) and was able to find them, as well as two others which I've also contacted, but there are a few I can't find.

Can you help me find this one? Here are some screenshots of the feed (I've blacked out the faces of the children):

I won't post the link to the stream but if you live in southern New York and you recognize this daycare/kindergaten center, can you please tell me who they are? Do they have a website? Is there a phone number or a way to contact them? I feel like they need to be made aware of this.

Now, I know you might suggest I tell the police, but who, exactly, do I tell? And how sure are you something will be done about it?

Thank you for any help.

Edit: I know it may sound strange to some of you, but I'm actually trying to help. I've already contacted Bullfrogs & Butterflies in Michigan, The Growing Years in Burlington and Angel Academy in Illinois via telephone (and was hung up on twice, but I can't really blame them).

These daycares and preschools are **completely unaware** their cameras are being live streamed and we can safely assume neither do any of the parents of the children. If you recognize this daycare, you can either contact them yourself (I will provide the info on the stream once you've proven you're really who you say you are, etc.) or you can help me by DM'ing me their website/number and I will call them myself.

Either way, they deserve to know.
