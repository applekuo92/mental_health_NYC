You can [download the relevant forms here](http://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingRegister.html), find someone on the streets who is taking registrations, or head to your local [County Board of Elections office](http://www.elections.ny.gov/CountyBoards.html).

Remember, NY is a closed primary, so you must select The Democratic or Republican party if you wish to vote in the appropriate primary.

However you do it though, get your skates on if you want to be involved in this epic election cycle.

If you're already registered and not already listed as a Democrat/Republican, you can't vote in the Primary.

The last day to register is March 25th - but leave it that late and you'll have to do it in person. Mail in your forms TODAY.
