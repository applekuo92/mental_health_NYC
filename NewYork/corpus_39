Hello fellow New Yorkers! 

/r/Plattsburgh has recently been revitalized and we're trying to grow the subreddit.

 If any of you are from the Clinton County area or would like to visit some day, please stop by the sub and subscribe! We've got plenty of michigans to go around!

/r/Plattsburgh is for:

* The City of Plattsburgh
* The Plattsburgh "micropolitan" area (Clinton County)
* SUNY Plattsburgh
* Plattsburgh tourism

So escape the city and come on up to Plattsburgh! I hope to see you there!
