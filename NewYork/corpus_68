I work M-F and require a significant amount of rest due to my health.  

Throughout the night, I was promted by myDMV that my registration could not be completed, but as soon as I tried by midnight, or at least slightly past, that it went through.  

I'm incredibly upset that this may hinder my ability to vote for my candidate of choice in the upcoming primaries.  Is anyone else dealing with this?
