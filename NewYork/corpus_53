My friend just got back from visiting New York (lives in the UK) with her boyfriend and she's really upset because her digital camera with *every* photo she took of the trip is missing. I know this is a long shot, but worth trying. But has anyone found a camera in or near the YMCA Vanderbilt hotel?

If you have, please PM me. Thanks.
