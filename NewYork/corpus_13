My cousin Alex went missing from Berkshire Farm.  I live in Philly so I am at a loss for how I can help but I figured I'd appeal to the Reddit community for advice.  

From my understanding, his residence of Berkshire Farm is essentially in the middle of woods and mountainous area so I am gravely concerned for his safety.  This isn't the first time he's escaped from the facility, and Berkshire isn't doing much to try and find him except put out a missing person's alert with NYS troopers.  What can I do?
