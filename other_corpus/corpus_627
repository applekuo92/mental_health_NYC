The Avengers are all but beaten by Thanos, who has anywhere between most and all of the Stones in the Infinity Gauntlet already. Maybe some of them have even died by his hand, their bodies cradled and mourned. The current leader (Cap, Stark, etc.) says something along the lines of "What else can we do? We're entirely outmatched by him, he's ready to warp reality itself, and no one is coming to help us."

Suddenly, a familiar voice. "Sounds like you guys need some backup."

Camera turns, and we see Fury standing side-by side with Coulson, looking quite well. Behind them, we have Coulson's team and The Defenders, already suited up and acquainted with one another, cracking knuckles and posing for the hero shot with the triumphant music in the background.

Then in Pt. 2, after Thanos loses the Gauntlet but while he does the cliched "I'm still powerful enough to kill you all" speech, his head just fucking explodes and we cut to The Punisher chambering another round with a grin on his face. (Far less likely, but I'd laugh my ass off.)
