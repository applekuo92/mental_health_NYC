I ordered a Bedset online for 4K which included the Bedset ( headboard, footboard, posts etc ), two dressers, a larger dresser and mirror for the larger dresser. Ordered from appliance connection, an online company. 

We got the delivery about 3 weeks ago but I didn't bother to put it together because we didn't have out mattress yet. Insert today, and I find out the headboard is missing. I know HUGE mistake on my part. When they delivered, I signed for the delivery of 7 boxes. Which is true, I received 7 boxes ( at the time I inspected some things to make sure everything was in good condition and it was ). Upon trying to figure out a way to save my ass, I see the delivery was set for 7 pieces : head board, footboard, rails, 2x night stand , mirror and large dresser. The "7" pieces I actually got were all of those minus the headboard. The posts for the headboard were in a separate box which is probably why at the time I signed off to the delivery of 7 pieces. What can I do???? I know it's a huge no, no but we opened a credit card with this company to finance the set. If they do not work with me to send the headboard how can I go about disputing the charge and cancelling it??? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
