Quick question to the fine people of personal finance. I'm a 23 year old who has never had anything in their name so I never built credit. So I recently went on credit karma just to see what my score would look like, when I finish everything I see that my score is crap 552. So thinking that can't be right I notice I was sent into collection for a lab bill I never received in 2014 and that it's open. The bill is only $132 which I can pay easily, but I fear that my credit is now ruined. What do I do?
