Hello, 
  
Sorry if some things are off in my spelling and grammar im still slightly druged. 

  
I was admin today for acute appendicitis. I under went emergency surgery and have been in recovery for about 8hrs now. 
  
I do not know what my insurance will cover but i have a 4000 deductible 75/25 after that and 10k max.   
  
I only recently started to try to manage my money better, because of that I have 1k in savings, and another in Stocks.  
  
I know this isnt gonna be cheap and will probably have to pay quite a bit. I was just wondering if any of you have any tips for dealing with hospital bills and what is a good way to deal with them. 

  
If anyone has any info on what i can expect or has been through this, it would be very much appreciated. I have never had to deal with something like this and am a bit worried.

  
Thank you.
