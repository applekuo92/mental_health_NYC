I've started playing Dishonored and got to the part where the boat guy has to take us to our first assassination mission.

Does it really get better from there on? Ever since I've started the game I was very underwhelmed by the lack of contrast and colors in the game and the "cinematic black bars" hurt my immersion. 

The assassination of the queen or empress or whatever felt really underwhelming to me as there was no character development leading me to not give a shit about the empress.

Her kid being kidnapped didn't give me any motivation either and I felt that I'd rather just join the bad guys than go after some weakly developed character.

Should I give the game a chance by giving it a full playthrough or should I just move onto another game since I haven't started to *like* this one yet.
