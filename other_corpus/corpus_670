Downgraded to a studio here in Seattle and the pre-war bldg came with what the realtor called a Murphy Door (kinda hard to explain, video has full narration).  I'd like to make a... I dunno,  Murphy Box that attaches to the door and is on casters so it can swing around but the door doesn't have to take the load. (https://youtu.be/sitEeuRugNg)

Will be using a full-size mattress and would  like it really low to the floor.

Any advice would be awesome before i start my design b/c a) I haven't worked construction in 15 yrs and b) my wife doesn't think there's any way this will happen.

Thx!
