So I have a USB phone charger cable that hasn't been working properly. The drawing tablet that I use the cable for kept disconnecting even at the slightest of movements to the wire, and to rectify I had to remove and reconnect the cable. I had to do this everytime and I got fedup. I thought maybe some dust or whatever was doing something to the device connecting end of the cable and so I took a needle and started rubbing it across the inside of it. By doing this my HD that was connected to the adjacent USB port disconnected and reconnected a couple of times. Apologies if it's not the right sub.
