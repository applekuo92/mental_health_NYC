Hey PF! Long-time lurker and fan! **I just finished paying down my student loans making me absolutely debt free!** I moved to a very rural town (Southeast Missouri) to work after pharmacy school two years ago so keep that in mind when I start rolling out the numbers.

* I make ~ 80K a year working 48 hours every 2-week pay period. I finished contributing the maximum to a 401K (65K total so far since inception) and Roth IRA (35K total since inception) just this week. I pay $300 a month for renting a house and I own my own car. I have 12k in liquid savings. My company matches some stock contributions (Walmart) and I have good health insurance.

* It's been about 2 years since school and I left with 60k in debt. I used a lot of the advice in this Sub to get to where I'm at now. It took a lot of discipline and budgeting and consistency.  I was also working full time right out of school so that I could pay everything down (I was making 133K at the time but rolled to part-time now because I want to have time for other things)

* Now I don't know what to do... I have a lot of excess income and I live in the middle of nowhere. I'll be able to continue to contribute the max to a 401K and Roth IRA, I'll still have no debt, and if my money situation changes I'll probably just get a raise.

Where do I put my excess money now? Thanks in advance
