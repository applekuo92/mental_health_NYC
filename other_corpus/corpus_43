So naturally with adult life, comes some responsibility and recently employed. I decided that it's time for me to get a credit card and start building credit. I got a student credit card I've used only about 10% of what I can use on the card and don't plan on using it for the rest of this month. I tried to see when my payments would be do so I could make sure to have money in my regular bank account. Though it just says pending. I activated the card oct.23, and thought it was strange. I called the automated number and it said payment is not required this billing period. What does this mean? Does it mean from Oct to Nov or all the way to December?! Kind of confused. Also any other advice is appreciated, I generally know how they work pay in full on time, don't go over 30% of the cards limit, spend on small items not on large.
