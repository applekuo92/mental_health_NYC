Considering we are 6 days out from Skyrim remaster, there might be some people out there who have never gotten the chance to experience mods for Skyrim... Whether it be for them being console only out of choice or not having a good enough computer (myself being of both the former and the latter). So, for the people who have experienced mods, what mops would yall suggest for those who will be experiencing mods for the first time on consoles?
