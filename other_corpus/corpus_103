So the deal is I busted my ACL/meniscus playing basketball back in college about a year ago but I've graduated now and will be starting a new job in a Hospital full time with great benefits like medical.I've done some research on my town that I should go with a low deductible plan to lower the cost of the impending surgery I plan to have on my knee 6 months after I begin working. 

My question is it better for me to disclose the pre-existing condition(torn ACL/ Meniscus) when they do my physical assessment and medical history for the insurance plan? 

Or should I could not disclose it and pass their physical/questionnaire easily and slowly bring to their attention that I am having knee pain and have the surgery done 6-7 months after employment? 

Can they look into any past medical history I've had along with doctor visits? 

Lastly, is a low deductible plan the best for someone looking to have surgery soon?
