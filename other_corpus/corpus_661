I had avoided this due to not being a Michael Bay fan..


All I can do after watching it is eat humble pie. It was great. Some of the cinematography and shots in this film are incredible and not what I would associate with a Bay film.


Krasinski may have been cast just for the final 'phone call' scene but WHAT a scene it was. 

Highly recommend to anyone who was in the same camp as me previously
