Does anyone know the best high yield checking and savings options for online banks? I'm not really interested in the ones that require 10 transactions a month to get 2-5%, but the ones where I can get maybe .5% or more in checking and 1% or more in savings without having to make any effort except maybe direct deposit.

Currently I use ally, but they don't have EMV on their debit cards and still over a year after the liability switch, have made no effort to add this feature. They also only do 0.10% on checking now, which feels kind of low, and limited ATM reimbursements to $10 a month.

I use Schwab for a no FTF debit card that refunds ATM fees, but they don't offer good interest rates to justify parking my money there.

So far the only other option I'm seeing is Alliant Credit Union which is basically like Ally, and but 0.65% on checking, they have EMV on their debit cards, they refund $20 a month for ATM's instead of $10, and they seem to also support multiple savings accounts for the envelope style system of saving that I like.

So my question is, compared to Ally and Alliant, are there any other better alternatives, or are those 2 of the best no effort online banking accounts out there?
