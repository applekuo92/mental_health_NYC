I was trying to remember the name of a game at PAX 2016 that had a weird cartoon art style that was similar to Space Dandy in color (With light pink and blue). It was set in space with a hex grid and you gathered cards to fit your deck which contained your equipment like a ray gun. The monsters only moved and attacked if you moved into a new hex.

The name is escaping me.
