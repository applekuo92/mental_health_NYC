I'm wanting to take out a personal loan for a much-needed vacation but have no idea where to start looking or what to look for.  I'm looking for in the range around 10k, but I'll take what I can get.  Any advice?
        
          
Edit: Ok seeing as all immediate responses are not to get a personal loan, let me please please ask that you put that aside for one moment and give me advice on how to go about getting a personal loan, not whether I should.

Edit: And to give some more details, my income-to-debt ratio is actually very good right now, tho my credit's in the low 600s I believe.  I'm a long-haul truck driver and been saving for this trip for a while, but an emergency arose which depleted much of it.  I don't want to reschedule tho as family and friends are all on board, so looking into this.
