I ask this question because I only have Netflix, and some other streaming services seem to have more recent, popular movies. I'm considering getting an Amazon Prime subscription, because Prime has movies like Ex Machina, Sicario, and The Witch, as well as major franchises like Lethal Weapon and The Matrix. Soon, most of the Rocky movies and most of the James Bond movies are going to be added as well. While Netflix definitely has the best original content, that doesn't really cover movies enough, in my opinion. 

Netflix currently has recent movies like Spotlight and The Big Short, as well as a small selection of IMDB Top 250 movies like Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, and The Usual Suspects. The Disney deal means that Marvel and Star Wars movies will be streaming on Netflix, Zootopia is already available, and The Jungle Book is coming in late November. The top four movies of this year (Captain America: Civil War, Zootopia, Finding Dory, and The Jungle Book) are, or will be, on Netflix, and by the end of the year, with Doctor Strange, Moana, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Disney could have the top seven of 2016. It's hard to argue against Netflix, since it has the rights to some of the most critically and commercially successful movies of the year. Still, franchises like Back to the Future and Lethal Weapon have left Netflix recently, and it seems like more movies are leaving by the month. 

Since Netflix is usually seen as the dominant streaming service, it's hard to argue against it. Yet, Hulu has recent episodes of TV added quickly, Amazon Prime has movies that are less than a year old constantly being added, and HBO Now has an excellent selection of great, recent movies. 

I'd love to know what you all think, what's your favorite streaming service for movies?
