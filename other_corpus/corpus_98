Hi, recently my bank switch over from First Niagara to Keybank. I really dislike how the switch happened, all of my online banking is unavailable for an unknown amount of time. Another thing I dislike is that they are closed on Saturday's. My question is what bank is best for me? I'm a 20 year old, living on my own and in college. I have two jobs, both of which I can use direct deposit. Thank you
