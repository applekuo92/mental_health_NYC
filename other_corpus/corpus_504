Hi everyone

I'm finally moving out within the next year and I'm so excited as its been my life goal.

Anyways when I move out I plan to have least 10k In the bank. After that I will probably be able to save away 800-1000 a month. This will leave me no money to do anything else but eat , live , and go to work. I understand that saving is really important but when  is it okay to chill out a bit and start putting away less? If I want to take a trip that month and will only out away 500 that month would It be okay? When can I relax a bit?

Here is an estimate of my living expenses. I dont know how much they'll actually be . Could be way more or way less. I'm splitting everything with my bf I'll be moving with. He has agreed that he will probably have no money left over ( working part time and school) after paying everything. I on the other hand work full-time and will have some more money left over.

I bring home about 2k a month

So rent will be no more then $700 (1300 I'm total) . Rent could be as low as 600 though.

Utilities? I'm estimating  $100 a month but could be more. I'm in NYC and don't know. Could be as low as 50 of split. Not sure.

Transportation? $100.
Cellphone? $50
Wi-Fi ?  $30
Food? About 200-300


So yeah. I'll have about 800ish left over . I'm hoping for a raise before I move out so maybe it'll look better.

Anyways, if I have about 10k saved up ( or more) is it safe to begin to put in less money?or should I just be a zombie and save all i have? I want to feel safe.

Thanks guys!
