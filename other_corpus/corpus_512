I am a teenager who grew up in a Christian home, but is questioning her faith. Music opens up a philosophical part of me, especially if the lyrics are deep. I need songs in the genres of alt rock, alt pop, indie rock and indie pop that are about spirituality and questioning it, because I'm in some sort of mode right now.

P.S. I do know there is a another subreddit where I could post this, but this is more populated, and this mind a lot lately, so I just want to ask more people.

edit: I have made a playlist on youtube of all the song reccs from here and r/popheads (I posted the same question there) any songs I like will probably be made into a Spotify playlist but IDK yet.
