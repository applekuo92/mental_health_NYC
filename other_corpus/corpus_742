A little thought and talent could take this series a long way! The movies (and TV series) were cool (some cooler than others) and the premise is incredible. Of all the reboots and updates, why aren't these getting the treatment!? I bet Michael Lambert, Roxanne Hart, Clancy Brown, and Sean Connery would be down to take part in small roles and hand over the series to a younger crew of bad asses.
