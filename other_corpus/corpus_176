* According to the profiles of each, they have fairly similar asset allocations...Schwab has about 5% more into domestic vs int'l with total stocks making up 90% of the portfolio. Both have pretty similar allocations in which industries they are invested in as well.

* These do differ a bit more in regards to their bond allocations though.

**Am i overthinking this? I should pretty much stick to Schwab with the lower rate?**
