Let's make something clear here. I might be in college, but I'm a shy, quiet man. Quite idiotic to be frank, since I'm studying law in the hopes of becoming an attorney at a non-profit in order to push criminal justice reform. On top of that, I work at a social work organization on campus known as "The Center for Servant Leadership", where student coordinators organize community service events and recruit students on campus to participate in such events. As someone living in Texas, I'm sick and tired of hearing how our state is so pathetically behind other states in the US in terms of education quality, lifestyle, etc. And so, I joined the organization as a Voter Registration Coordinator, in the hopes to get college age students to learn the importance of voting and actually registering to vote.

Now, as a shy guy, you can imagine how mortified I was when I learned that I was he only male in the 13-member group. Yep. 12 women, 1 man. 

"Great! More shy, quiet moments that I'll remember about college. As if that hasn't happened to me before." 

Surprisingly, however, all 13 of them were rather cute and beautiful in their own way. But one of them caught my eye- Abby. See, whereas I was a senior, she was a Sophomore. I was Latino, she was White. I wasn't exactly the hottest guy on school, whereas for me, she was beautiful in every way. Her short, smooth blonde hair. Her glasses. Her body. Her piercing blue eyes and laugh that would make me smile even when I felt down. Everything about her was perfection. Until the horrifying mistake I did.

I guess I should introduce myself. The names' Sal. I attend a small, liberal arts university in a rural town in Texas. Our library is open 24/6, Granted, I am notorious to be the only one in the library past midnight; I enjoy working on my homework late in the wee hours of the morning. Even though it remains open, there is nobody at the help desk to help. The library consists of a basement, the main floor, and the second floor. Me being the one who enjoys the concept of dead silence and loneliness, I made my way to the basement and situate myself to write my 10 page paper due in a few days. 2 pages, and nearly 2 hours later, movement caught the corner of my eye. Started and mortified, I quickly shift my eyes to see what had moved. It was Abby. She too, came to the library at nearly 2 in the morning to work on her homework.

"Hi, Sal! It's nice to run into somebody this late at night in such an eerie setting... mind if I sit at your table and work on my homework?"

"No, ma'am", I replied. "I'd enjoy some company right now, that's for sure. If I keep writing essays this late at night, I might go insane".

She laughed. God, that laugh. It's so loud, yet beautiful and innocent in a way. I would glance at her every once in a while, trying to decipher what the reflection of her crystal blue eyes was showing me. 

A good 50 minutes had passed, and it was nearly 3AM, when I decided to suck up my courage and tell her my feelings towards her. It was just us two- what could possibly go wrong?

"Hey... Abby?" Her eyes peeked up at me, that warm smile piercing through my soul. "I... I've been meaning to tel you something." Her warm smile slightly flinched.

"F-From the moment I met you for the first time, I had thought of you as somebody special. You are incredibly passionate, intelligent, and care for the well being of others, like myself. You are a hardworking, intelligent woman who knows how to take care of herself. But most of all, you are you. You're a beautiful soul in and out." 

Her warm smile was a poker face at this point. "She's just as stubborn with boys as I am with women", I thought.

"W-Would you like to hangout sometime, and maybe... watch a m-movie together?", I stuttered. Light from her laptop reflecting from her eyes, I could tell they were no longer warm. Her poker face disappeared into that of a neutral face.

Nervous to look at her again, I shifted my eyes to my laptop. "You... you..." she stuttered. Her warm voice was replaced with that of a hellish one. She practically sounded like a serial killer. "You...", she kept repeating. At this point, I was packing my laptop into my backpack, terrified of even looking at her. 

"Is this how women act when someone they have no interest in-"

"**RUN**". **RUN**." It wasn't that she said to run, but the way she said it- that terrified me. It was like her beautiful laughter, only it echoed through the basement like a million demon voices speaking at one. The lights in the basement began to flicker on and off. I was beyond terrified. **THREE STRIKES... RUN**. I had never exited a library quicker than I did that moment. 

At this point, the entire library, as well as all the buildings and light post across campus, had lost power. Only the occasional peek of moonlight illuminated the path to my dorm. Problem is, it's a straightway and rather far. "**R**... **U**...", I faintly heard behind me. I refused to look at Abby- whatever it was, and took off like my life depended on it. "**N**..."

A group of students not far from me caught my attention. They seemed to be walking towards their dorms-the same building I lived in. Somehow, someway, I caught up with them. 
"H-Hi. Y-you..", i said panting. 

"Sal?!" Abby.

 She turned around, and faced me. She looked at me, startled and perplexed. I backed away slowly from the group. It was her, alongside a few of the ladies that I work with "No. No. NO. NO NO NO NO NO", my mind screamed. I had JUST seen her at the library! How the hell did she manage to catch up with this group of students when they were CLEARLY in my POV the entire time??!

"*Manitou*". "*Manitou*", Abby said. She might be white, but as far as I knew, she also had Native American ancestry in her. I assumed she was speaking in native tongue."*Manitou*", she said again.

Our friends and I looked at her perplexed. 
"Inside the building. NOW", she demanded. 

We ran into the building, and into our own rooms. Thing is, a giant window that is on the front of my room that looks outside is the same area where Abby and I were standing. Curious to look out, I begin to open the blinds. 

"DON'T", I hear in front of me. Startled and terrified, I shut the blinders tight and rely on the weak shadow I see of Abby reflecting due to moonlight through the blinds. Silence. Nothing but dead silence. She hasn't moved a muscle. It became so quiet, I could hear her breathing. I could tell make out her breathing through her faint shadow through the blinders. 

She turns at a 90 degree angle- and faces my window. Startled but silent, I back up slowly. She takes a few steps towards my window, and stops right in front of it. Her silhouette was still visible through the blinders. Mortified, I retreat to my bed and cover my face. She's still there- or at least I hope it's still her. 

*knock knock*. Someone was at my door. Having nearly suffered a stoke, I back slowly towards the door while keeping an eye on the silhouette to see who it was. Abby. It was Abby again. 

"W-WHAT?!", I exclaimed mentally. 
"NO. SHE'S STILL OUTSIDE. SHE TOLD ME NOT TO LOOK."
I peaked through my door's eye viewer to see who it was. It was definitely Abby. And she was holding a strange handcrafted object that resembled a wind chime in her hand.

I turn back to the blinders only to realize that there was no moonlight- no silhouette. Mortified, I turn back to the Abby by the door. She hangs the mysterious object near my door, and walks away.

Without moonlight, and being too scared to even peek through my blinds, I decide to hop into bed and sleep. As my eyes shut, I could make out the noise of heavy breathing coming from the window. I ignore it, and fall asleep. 

It is morning right now of the following day, and Abby has come over to my room to "check up on me". She's here with me right now, but I am unsure as to whether to trust her or not in what she does in my room. She seems to be... well, herself... but after last night... I am unsure.
