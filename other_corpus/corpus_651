Game will begin in 3, 2, 1...    
I'm talking to    
you, the perfectly sanctioned embodiment of imperfection.  Here's the lesson    
in broad generics, not specifics to the collective, introspective generations.    
Where there was once the positive, but now you live trying to see through    
to the other side, why confide in any lie?  You must abide.  Yes, I'm talking to    
you.    
Next Level.    
You can't cock the glock, because glocks don't cock. Watch the clock.    
Is D-day coming soon?  It's only noon and you're melting from shock.    
Talk yourself down from this meltdown.  The crown's too heavy and blue.    
Try some vernacular waltzin like Christopher Walken. Yes, I'm talking to    
you.    
Pause.    
That cyanide pill stuck inside of your mouth, spit it out. How    
could your last breath come so fast if your past cowers behind you now?    
Don't conspire with the pain, the misfires in your brain gone askew.    
You've been fed up.  Don't dare let up.  Get your head up.  Yes, I'm talking to    
you.    
Boss Battle.    
Boat's still afloat. Keep that record goin and go spin some positive notes.    
Dont let external forces or common sources dictate all of your quotes.    
Stake the claim to your name.  Feel no shame in your game and pursue    
your happiness and love blessed with conciousness.  Yes, I'm talking to    
you.    
Continue?    
Press continue in this venue.  You have more tokens. Truth be spoken.    
Your dreams aren't broken.  It seems you need a galaxy of energy to soak in.    
Meditate or pray away the dismay, and seize the day with clarity renewed.    
The importance is the distance you run until it's done. Yes, I'm talking to    
you.
