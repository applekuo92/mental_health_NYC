I currently contribute 6% of my paycheck pre-tax towards my 401(k) because my employer will match up to the 6%, dont want to lose any free money there. I am debating between maxing out my 401(k) this year, $18,000 contributed, knowing that i can borrow against my 401(k) for down payment of my first primary residence, OR just continuing my 6% and savings all of the extra cash in my savings account.

This might be trickier and have all sorts of ifs/buts involved, but thought i would throw out a few of my thinking points as to why i am debating this.

1) I am a single male with no dependents on taxes and by maxing out my 401(k) i would save some money on the federal taxes i have to pay this year. Since my 401(k) is pre-tax i would be using pre-tax money for the down payment and pre-tax money to re-pay myself as well. Ultimately this plan seems like it might be my tax evasion plan, a co-worker put the bug in my ear on this.

2) continue just the 6% and take everything else and save save save to just do it all with cash.

Regardless i will have the amount saved i need for my down payment by the time i plan on buying, just wondering if there is a real tax/long term advantage to messing with the 401(k) plan.
