My finances 22 weeks pregnant, working in a busy cafe and getting very tired during the day/week. I thought I'd ask ideas from women who've been there before. What are some things you enjoyed doing while pregnant? What relaxed you? What are some things you wished people had done?etc Also she's got a really bad cough at the moment any good remedies? Any helps appreciated thanks.
