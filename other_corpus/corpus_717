I'm an Irish-American (dual citizen), spent the majority of my life living in fair Ireland. Graduated from university this year, planning on moving to the states next September-ish. I'm aware having a good credit rating will really help with getting a rental contract, maybe a small car financing deal, but I have absolutely zero credit history in the US. Thinking of getting a credit card and using it as a debit card, only spending the money in my account, but how can I ensure that the credit rating I build up will count towards my rating in the States? If I open it with an American company will that work? (I have zero debt and a stable salary here in Ireland if that makes a difference).
