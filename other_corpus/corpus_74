What is the meaning of song "Super Taranta!" by Gogol Bordello?

This song is connected with their other song "Supertheory of Supereverything", which is song about guy who reads Bible the first time and starts thinking that God "doesn't have sense of humor".

"Super Taranta!" lyrics are:
"Second time I read the Bible
I was thinking, 'It's alright, man'
I was thinking najdedajdaj
I v dushe vse na gitarkah

Ai, ai, shadows of forbidden existence
Come with me, to the future now!"

What's that mean? It is suppose to be pro-religion song?
