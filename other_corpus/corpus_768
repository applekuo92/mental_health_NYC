It's actually more of a horror/comedy, and goes full Sam Raimi.  It reminded me of the tone that Trick R Treat or the second/third Evil Dead movies struck than anything else.  It's aware of the tropes of the genre, and subverts them.

The "cross-over" from the first movie is minimal, and you can enjoy this one while pretending the other Ouija doesn't exist.  

It doesn't rely on jump scares, and the few times there are those sudden jumps, they're well deserved and/or hilarious.  

Great characters, really solid performances, features a grown up Elliot from ET, and just all around feels really playful, energetic, and frighteningly fun. 

Check out the Official Discussion if you don't believe me, it caught me waaaaay off guard. The most fun I've had at a horror movie since Krampus.
