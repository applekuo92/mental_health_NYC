Hello, My mother recently informed me that she has breast cancer and lymph cancer. I would like your advice on how I can be supportive. I live on a different continent, I can't travel to see her for over one years time. We talk by phone once a week on Sunday and I don't know what to say. She informed me over e-mail today so tomorrow is the first time we would speak about this subject. I have no idea how to be supportive in such a situation. I have no idea what she may possibly be feeling. I have tried to conduct research on the matter but it seems every website offers advice that is board-line offensive ("talk about thinks they like", "dont tell them about people who have died"). I'm lost. I have no idea what to do. I apologize if this does not fit your criteria, is in the wrong place, or is insensitive. If it is please at least tell me where to go to find more information.
