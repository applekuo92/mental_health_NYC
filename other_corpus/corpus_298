Some background;
I'm a 19 year old college student and I'm trying to decide how to get my credit established. I'm a full time student in my second year and I make about $400 a month just working part time for my university. In the summer months I work at home making about $500-$600 a month but this year it should be more.

I'm thinking of getting a student card, possibly discover, as it has 0% APR for the first six months. I planned on trying to get this card in December so I could buy next semesters books and other items with it and then take advantage of the 0% APR to pay off my balance in the six months.

So my big question is is it better when establishing credit to pay my balance each month off in full, or is it better to make regular payments carrying a balance for the first couple of months? 

I'd like to think I'm a pretty knowledgeable young adult, but I'm unsure how to go about this. Any answers for this question would be greatly appreciated and any tips you have on how to build credit for a young college student would be great!
