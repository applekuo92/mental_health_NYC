Hello everybody. Thanks to student loans I have poor credit. While my credit score has improved the last couple years, it's nowhere near where I want it. So I'm taking steps to improve it. I have 0 credit card debt and no credit cards. Therefore I can only get one myself through a secured card. Or I could be added as an authorized user to my fiances (Who has excellent credit because I've used her credit the whole time she was in college.) I'm just curious which one would improve my credit at the fastest rate. Any input will be greatly appreciated!
