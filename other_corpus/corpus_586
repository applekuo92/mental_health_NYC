I've saved all my life, and have not recently gotten the opportunity and an incredible job and make great money. I don't know how long this opportunity will last but I do foresee myself making over $200,000 for the next couple years. Right now I want to buy a home for my wife and myself but I'm not sure how much I should put down what I should invest, how I should invest. Any quick tips for me to get the ball rolling and put some ideas in my head?
