This is my fist post so please forgive any formatting errors, as I'm sure there will be lots.

I have an outstanding bill from Verizon wireless that has been sent to collections. One credit report dates this in April 2014 and another as opened this month. The amount owed is roughly  $1100.

I would like to know the best way to handle this debt, as i am trying to fix my credit after years of neglect. I don't know if the best option is to fight the bill, just pay it, or what else to do.

I have a few issues with this bill. At the time, my wife and I were going through a tough patch in our marriage. During this time I called my cell phone provider to ask them about changing my passwords and such to secure my account. Shortly after talking to them, I was notified of other changes to my account. My wife had called to make changes to the bill, gaining access to the account through the use of my SSN. I called the phone company back and was told there was nothing they could do secure my account because she new my SSN. At this point I transferred my account to a different company and did not pay the early termination fees. I feel that I didn't have a choice but to break my contract with them because they could not secure my account.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and any advice or insight is appreciated.
