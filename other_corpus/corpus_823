I grew up in Las Vegas, and my dad would tell me about his love for the Dodgers and what it was like to see Kirk Gibson hit his home run in 1988. Since I was a boy, I've always romanticized the Dodgers and the game of baseball. We never had a professional baseball team in LV so the Dodgers were the closest we could get to hometown comraderie. Why do you love your favorite team?
