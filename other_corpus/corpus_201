This happened yesterday. I was hungry, so what better to eat than some chicken tenders breaded in Cheez Its? So took out a pan, put some oils in the pan, and dropped in the chicken tenders. I decided to add some stuff into the mix. I took some pepper and sprinkled it in. I also crushed up some pork rinds and added them. Then I had the grand chef idea to add a little chicken broth in. I don't eve know why. I told myself not to do it, as well. I knew oil and water don't mix. I still did it, though. Right when the broth hit the sizzling oil, a huge fire erupted from the pan. I freaked out and turned off the burner. The fire stopped, and I continued to finish up my tenders. They tasted amazing. This isn't the first time i failed really hard at cooking something that should've been easy to cook.


tl;dr: I made some pretty good chicken tenders by setting them aflame, almost burning down a house a second time.
