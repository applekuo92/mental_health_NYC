There are some really great podcasts out there like Freakonomics, Stuff You Should Know, and Revisionist History. Podcasts seem to be in an era where there's high levels of competition to provide high quality stories and information. Seems like that's what journalism used to be. Now I feel like reading the news is worse then wasting time. Its like there's only an intent to increase clicks and likes. It seems to lead to misleading information. At least there's still a great source of news and stories.
