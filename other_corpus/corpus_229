OK so I was watching pirates of the caribbean for the first time in a while, I don't remember a lot about when I first saw the movie, except for when the pirates first invade Port Royal, and they go knocking on Elizabeth's door and shoot the servant. I distinctly remember them shooting a female servant, but watching it now it's male. Am I just crazy or did they make some kind of change?
