So im 3/4 way through install and have all the wall tiles set. I used durock for the walls but didnt use a waterproof membrane over the top, just thinset and tile. I will not be tearing the walls out to redo them as this is way too costly. I am installing a pan liner to trap any water on the floors though. What is my prognosis on stability long term? Will my wall tiles fall off eventually from moisture penetration? What are any other concerns i should have?
