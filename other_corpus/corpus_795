My game is called Dot Swap, and It's been a few hours since my game's been published on the Google Play Store. Here's a screenshot of the Google Play Dev Console: [click](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzkj84fbefa7sxv/devconsole.PNG?dl=0)

Here's a screenshot of the screen when I click the 'view in play store' link: [click](https://www.dropbox.com/s/way02q6lg6mzs80/playstore.PNG?dl=0)

And of course it's no where to be seen when I search for it... Does anyone have any idea what's happening?
