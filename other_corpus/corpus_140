I'm looking to learn more about the history of Britain, covering a period (roughly) of 500 BC to the 1800s. 

I would particularly like to learn more about how the countries in Britain were eventually formed and love the Saxon to medieval periods. 

Does any great book out there just so happen to cover these specifics?
