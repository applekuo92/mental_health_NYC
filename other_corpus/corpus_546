Hey r/gaming, black gamer here. I know the whole BF1 black people drama has been ruining the game for some of you guys. But honestly is it that bad? 

I'm asking a genuine question here, I know the majority of gamers are white males and most gaming companies market towards that (no shame in that, I absolutely agree). But is this whole BF1 thing worth upvoting such blatant thinly veiled racism.

I know it's about historical accuracy and all. However the game was never going to be historically accurate. Focusing on the black soldiers issue seems so monotonous at this point.

When game devs see this they aren't going to worry about historical accuracy, they are going to worry about diversity in gaming not selling and thus stop trying to include that.

I don't know what my point is exactly but I'm trying to say most of the people complaining about this have such obvious racist intentions behind this. And it feels shit because gaming is becoming another thing that I, and most other black gamers, feel like we're being pushed out.

I understand your frustrations but please be more civil when discussing these matters.
