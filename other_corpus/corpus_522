A family friend has offered me the opportunity to buy a house that she owns. She is asking for $35,000 the property is worth approximately $80,000. I have $55,000 in my 401k that is fully vested and about $6,000 in cash. My credit score is 780+. I'd like to take a loan for the entire $35,000. The house is in move in condition, I'd use it as an investment property. I do not currently own a home.
