I'm on the train writing this, it literally happened a few hours ago. I decided to go home for my University's study break and booked a train. Me being the irresponsible traveler I am, i'm just scrolling through reddit instead of getting ready. Eventually it hits the time where I realize i'm probably going to miss my train if I don't get moving. Now earlier I had started charging my new iPhone that I got after shattering the screen on my old phone. I have a very long charging cable and it tends to get wrapped around things very easily. This is where the fuck up begins. In my rush I hadn't noticed the cable wrapped around my shoes, and when I jumped up to get ready the cable swung the phone up and slammed it on the ground with the strength of Hercules himself. So here I am on the train with my cracked phone, cutting myself trying to entertain myself on social media.
