This series is hilarious from start to finish.With just the right amount of feels. The plot involves a Government run by Magicians, who use Demons(Djinni) to fight in wars.They also make the djinni do menial tasks like driving cars or assassinating enemies.The main characters are; Bartimaeus,a Djinni,and Nathaniel,the kid who summoned him. The three books involve them; stealing a powerful artifact,fighting a Golem and finally fighting an army of Djinni that have possessed the Government.So basically,a bunch of completely insane plots.It also has a rebel faction that tries to destroy the government and an Afrit(stronger being) that possesses a dead body and runs around causing havoc. The books are set in Britain and told from Bartimaeus' perspective,which gets pretty funny because Bartimaeus has a snide comment on everything and everyone.
