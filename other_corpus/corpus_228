I work 8-5 Monday through Friday. I'm 30 and it took me years to get a decent job with that shift, but having a consistent sleep and work schedule is EXTREMELY helpful if you want to be more alert and productive throughout the day.

My alarm goes off at 4:40 every morning, even on my days off. Sometimes I roll around and snooze for an hour, but I'm usually out of bed by 6. I don't actually need an alarm anymore, I've been on this sleep schedule for a couple years and my body just wakes up automatically at the same time, my alarm just serves as a reminder of the time.

Soooo much less stressful if you just always wake up at the same time. My coworkers spend the first 2 hours of their day chugging coffee desperately trying to pull themselves out of a deep sleep, while I'm at full alert the moment I clock in without ever drinking coffee.

Now the sacrifice you gotta make is you gotta listen to your body when you get tired. Sometimes I'm about to conk out by 8 pm, other nights I end up awake until midnight. Still wake up automatically at the same time, like my biological clock has it's own alarm programmed in now.

The phrase "early to bed early to rise" etc etc definitely has some meaning to me.
