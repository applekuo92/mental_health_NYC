I have an i5 6200u 2.4GHz, 8gb ddr4 RAM, geforce 920mx 2gb. Will I be able to run Skyrim Special Edition with this specs despite being lower than the minimum requirements specified on the internet?

I'm able to run The Witcher 23-30 fps on low, Fallout 4 30-40fps on med-low. I'm just wondering if I'll be able to enjoy the remaster of one of my favorite games.

Thanks!
