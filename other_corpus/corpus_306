On a long enough timeline machine intelligence will greatly surpass humans at everything. 

But what about the next decade or so, what do you think machine intelligence will be like in the 2020s and how will it differ from today? 

I think one thing that people don't realize is machine intelligence in the 2020s will make sexual abuse or any other kind of abuse almost impossible to get away with. I predict in the 2020s that cameras will be able to read our emotions and body language better than they do now. So if someone suddenly shows up and is giving off a large number of body language or emotional signals that something really bad happened, the camera will realize that and inform the right people. As a result, it'll be harder to get away with abuse. 

On that note, I think mental illness undiagnosis will become more rare for the same reason. Cameras will be able to distinguish small changes in our behavior, emotions, writings and body language that could signify the start of a mental illness. 

Right now, machine intelligence in the form of google greatly enhances our cognitive capacities. I think machine intelligence will do the same for our social and emotional skills in the 2020s. 

Other than that, I don't think strong AI will exist in 2020. Narrow AI will be better at more things. I think they will surpass humans at all video games (as opposed to the current crop of AI which can only beat humans at 3rd generation video game consoles). 

I think we will start seeing the benefits of devices like Watson in medicine and other fields. 

Self driving cars will be reasonably common. Not everywhere, but people will see them daily.
