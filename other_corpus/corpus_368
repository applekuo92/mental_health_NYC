I need some ideas for where to paint furniture. I cannot paint in the house/garage. Can I paint it outside? If so, how do I protect it from animals/bugs getting in the paint?

Project is one bare wood piece and one laminate piece both getting painted white. Oil base paint and polycrylic top coat. From what I read it could take up to a month to cure.

Any help is very much appreciated!
