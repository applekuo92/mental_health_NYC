A pretty simple question... I've been curious! If an employer matches up to 8% pre-tax, and I've chosen to contribute 8% post-tax, do they tend to match off of the % so I'm fully matched, or would they go off of the dollar amount, meaning I'm not maxing out their match?

(I was advised to switch from pre-tax to post so that I can put more away for a house down payment.)
