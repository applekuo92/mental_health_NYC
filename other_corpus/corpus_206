**Sometimes I get too angry.** Something bad happens to me or someone I love. Then, I get extremely angry at the person or people that caused that bad thing to happen.

## My car got towed and it sucked

My car got towed a week ago. I drove some friends and myself to a restaurant near us. But, there were no available parking spots in this restaurant’s parking lot. So, we parked in the nearby [McDonald’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s) parking lot. Little did we know there were a couple of well-hidden signs warning people they would get towed if they wrongfully parked in the McDonald’s lot.

So, my car got towed. One of my other friend’s cars got towed as well. It felt super shitty. I had to pay $325 to remove my car from impound. Luckily for me, my friends chipped in to help cover the $325. Things ended up not being too bad. However, I became irate when the tow company employee came up to my friend and me to tell us that our cars had been towed.

The employee who told us our cars had been towed was an asshole. He enjoyed telling us that we’d have to pay $325 to get our cars back. This man talked about how he had gotten great pictures of our cars being wrongfully parked because it was still light out when he took them. He happily told us that we wouldn’t be able to pick up our cars until Monday even though they had been towed on Saturday.

*In the face of this mean-spirited, unkind man, I lost it and got really angry.* My friend whose car also got towed lost it as well. Some of our friends who were there became irate too. In the moment it felt so, so good to get mad at this man. It felt good to yell at him and tell him he had no decency. In the day and a half after my car got towed it still felt really good to talk about the shittyness of the tow company and its employee.

However, after a certain point, it no longer felt good to be so angry at the tow company or its mean employee. **Instead, it just felt embarrassing.** I felt embarrassed that I had yelled expletives at someone in public. I felt embarrassed that I had lost my composure to the point where I was mean and disrespectful to another human being. And, I had now wasted two days of my life being angry.

If I hadn’t been so angry or so filled with mean-spirited feelings towards the tow company, I would have been more productive. *Maybe I would have been productive to the point where I did $325 of work to remove my car from impound.* Or, maybe I would have only done $100 of work. Either way, feeling angry for a bit and then letting it go would have been a much healthier thing.

It’s healthy and good to feel angry from time to time. When someone is mean to you or something shitty happens, you should feel angry. But, it’s not healthy, good, or okay to take that anger out on someone else by being mean or disrespectful to them.

When you’re mean to someone who was mean to you, they’ll respond by being even meaner and more unkind to you. Responding to meanness with meanness only creates more meanness. And the world doesn’t need any more meanness or unkindness than it already has.

When my friends and I were mean to the tow company employee who had treated us poorly, he upped the ante by treating us even worse. What do you think happened at that point in the interaction? If you guessed that my friends and I were even more angry and mean to the tow truck employee, then you were right.

**Again, being mean felt good in the moment, but I was disgusted with myself in the long run.** My parents had taught me that “two wrongs don’t make a right.” Yet, I had tried to fix a wrong by committing a wrong myself and found out that two wrongs just make everyone feel worse.

## Disarm meanness with kindness

If someone is mean to you, it’s okay to be angry at that person. But, it’s not productive to be mean back to them. Instead of being mean to someone who was mean to you, be kind to them. *If you respond to someone’s meanness with kindness, you will likely throw them off guard and disarm them.* In fact, the person who was being unkind to you may start to treat you with a lot more kindness. Here’s an example:

Recently I posted one of [my articles](http://jackkaufman.net/be-like-louis-ck-increase-revenue-by-using-comedian-marketing/) to [r/standupcomedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/). The article was received well, but one person wrote angry/unkind comments about it. Instead of responding to these angry/unkind comments with my own anger, I responded to them with kindness.

I was mad at the people who wrote mean comments under my post. But I didn’t respond to these people with anger or meanness. I took a few moments to collect myself and responded as kindly as I could.

If I had provoked the proverbial beasts by responding to their meanness with my own unkindness, the result wouldn’t have been good. The commenters would have felt badly. They also would have likely lashed out at me in anger, which would have made me feel badly too.

After responding to the mean commenters with kindness, they either didn’t respond or responded with kindness as well. A tense and potentially destructive situation became a constructive one.

**It’ll be tough for you to be kind when people are mean to you.** After all, when people belittle your work, personality, appearance, or other personal characteristics, it hurts. It’s natural to want to hurt the people who hurt you. But, if you uplift the people who hurt you instead, you will be happier and you’ll make someone else’s life better.

Feel the anger you need to feel in a constructive, private, and kind way after someone is mean to you. *Then, respond to their hurtful actions with kind actions.* It may seem counterintuitive, but you’ll live a better life by following this piece of advice.
