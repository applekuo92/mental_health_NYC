Hi, sorry for the off topic, but you may know my question. I use to read some hours a day, and always used a daylight incandescent lamp (about 3100 k). But know in my country incandescent lights are forbidden, I tried with halogen, cfl, led... But my eyes hurt... What light do you use? If you could help me I would be very grateful.
