My son recently turned five and I've decided to give him an allowance of $10/week. To 'earn' the allowance he has to try hard, behave well at school since his 'job' is to learn. 

I worked with him to set a budget $2 to savings, $1 to charity, $5 for fun and $2 for gifts (Christmas, birthdays, and the like).

This is similar to how my father did my allowance as a child and I used a check book that he didn't need. I do everything online and eventually I'd like him to track it via a spreadsheet or mint. But to help him learn math, I'd like him to initially do the math by hand. 

Does anyone have suggested (already built) printable spreadsheets for something like this? I can fairly easily build my own. But, I figure people must have already done this.
