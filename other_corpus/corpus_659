Been on Craigslist for a few weeks now and I really need a car to replace my old honda beater  that was in a car accident (not at fault). But the asking prices on there are just ridiculous, most of which are late 90s-early 00s with more than 160K miles and they're asking for like 3.5K-4K and some of them haven't even had their timing belt and water pump done yet. That is the same price range I got my old honda beater a decade ago  but it had 75K miles and was running well. There are also pos cars on there that have some kind of transmission problems or any major problems really and they want between$800-$1500. Simply put, hunting for an old honda beater on Craigslist has been very frustrating and I don't know if I should just get a pre owned car from the dealership. It'll cost more but at least I don't have to deal with mechanical problems anytime soon.
