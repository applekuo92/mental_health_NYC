I've always found this issue paradoxical.

Almost by definition, increasing technological unemployment goes hand in hand with increasing post-scarcity. Think 10-15 years down the road when future Watson type medical Expertise AI can do most medical diagnosis.  Sure lots of humans Doctors will be un/underemployed - but that AI can be replicated endlessly out to 8 billion on the whole planet for pennies each.  

We don't have that just yet, but we could build post-scarcity college & adult education - why don't we?

All the tech is there - you can see it with Coursea, Udacity, Khan Academy, etc, etc - but its all still on the margins of education.

Building a post-scarcity education system is much more achievable too; it doesn't require huge political change or a referendum 

Yet - even though UBI/technological unemployment & post-scarcity are so closely coupled - why is it only one side of this equation seems to get all the attention?
