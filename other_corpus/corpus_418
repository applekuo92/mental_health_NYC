Near the end of the last episode when Randy was describing Star Wars and how everything now a days is "'member.....member! member.....", it struck a chord in me. I see clearly the exact meaning of the 'member berries, now I see the metaphor clearly.


Entertainment is just destroyed by nostalgia. Nothing is original anymore, imagine how many fresh original ideas would have been made if the energy was put toward new original ideas instead of remakes?I get nostalgic too, we all do, but god damn this show made a point, nothing is original anymore. People hype shit up all the time, the show was right. The latest Star Wars was not even all that great. On the front page of Reddit today, people were excited about the Nintendo Switch remastering Elder Scroll's Skyrim. That game was released 5 years ago and me and every other gamer played it to death, I want something new, but obviously not everybody. Instead people are excited about a remastered Skyrim. This was exactly South Park's point. People are being consumed by their nostalgia and creativity is being suffered because of it. Its ok to be nostalgic and play your old video games and remember your childhood, but its no ok to want remakes and remasters all the time. Thank you South Park. You are always wise......


TL;DR - People are excited about a remastered Skyrim, rather than wanting a new Elder Scroll's game after 5 years
