I understand that biodiversity helps promote the continuation of life through increased chances of survival in case of some sudden calamitous event. But whats the point of saving last few members of a dying race, especially if they don't have any beneficial uses to humanity? If anything, just preserve DNA/fluid samples for future reference. I don't mean to be insulting but objectively, it does seem like resources could better be utilized elsewhere.
