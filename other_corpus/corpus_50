I notice music can often be described with a mood, such as 'uplifting' or 'sombre'. Suppose two people listened to a particular mood of music for the first time in their life, would they be in agreement of what kind of mood that music created? Is it possible for someone to listen to 'uplifting' music and feel personally that it is 'sombre'?
