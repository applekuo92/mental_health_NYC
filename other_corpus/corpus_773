Do I still have to type 300 characters, to get a good conversation going?  Okay.  

In MULHOLLAND DRIVE, halfway through the movie Naomi Watts turns into the other hot lady, or something, but it never loops all the way back to the beginning.  But in LOST HIGHWAY, it starts out with Bill Pullman, flips into the story of Balthazar Getty, then somehow flips right back around to the beginning of the Bill Pullman part.  If you were watching the movie on a loop at a movie theater, you could go in AT ANY TIME, stay and watch things happen, and then leave when you see "This is the part where I came in".  And if you haven't seen Lost Highway, sorry about the [SPOILERS].

PULP FICTION quite famously looped around with the structure, but the framing device of the coffeehouse robbery means it does seem to have a beginning and an end after all.  Oh well. 

So, what other movies have "Mobius loop" plot structures?

PRIMER, perhaps.
