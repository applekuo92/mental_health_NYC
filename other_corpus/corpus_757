So I'm a fairly normal dude in my late 20s. I Work full time, focusing on building my career and starting a family with my girlfriend that I live with and also share financial obligations with. I have always had a nerdy side I enjoy the occasional fantasy novel, play video games but I don't make it something that consumes my life, I enjoy "normal" social stuff as well. Growing up I bounced around different clicks and could get along with just about anyone but I always felt shameful about my nerdy side....

Anyways I started playing a game in which the main character uses a longsword so I started researching info on longswords (I have a obsessive googleing problem) and before I knew it I learned quite a bit about swords and such. Eventually I ended up ordering a sword for a couple hundred bucks on a website with a shit return policy and it's on its way via ups and I have not told my girlfriend for 2 reasons 

1. Even though we are financially stable we usually talk about purchasing things we don't need.

2. She is for sure gonna roast me for being a man-child

Oh man feels good to get that off my chest

Tl;Dr bought a sword and now scared of girlfriend
