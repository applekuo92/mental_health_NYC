Some of my old student debt is $3000 at about 3% APY. Currently I'm paying $140 a month for it. At this rate it should be paid off in about 2 years. Or I can pay it off early and stop paying the extra $140 per month (although only $8/month interest). But I have minimal savings and I wanted to build a $10k emergency fund just in case (I have access to about $25 credit card credit). Any suggestions?
