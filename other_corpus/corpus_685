A new Officer arrives in Afghanistan and is being shown around by a Sergeant. They walk by a donkey tied up in a pen and the officer asks what it's purpose is.

The Sergeant explains "The men use it when they have certain...urges. it gets very lonely out here"

The Officer looked a little disgusted but says that while he doesn't approve, he can understand.

Six months go by and the Officer is getting urges himself and decides that he has to go use the donkey.

Hes banging away, balls deep in the donkey, when suddenly the Sergeant walks past, sees what the officer is doing and stands there with a look of confusion and disgust on his face.

"Am I doing it right? Isn't this how the men do it?" asks the Officer

"Well, no sir, they usually just ride the donkey down to the next village where the brothel is"
