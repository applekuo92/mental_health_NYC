I have been studying Humanities and Social Sciences at an Bachelor and Masters level now for 4 years, and have, reluctantly accepted the use of Academic English in my writing. My question however, is why do we use such a complicated form of English to get our ideas across. I do understand why there needs to be a certain form of professionalism involved, and I also understand the use of jargon in any field, scientific or not. My question is just that what is wrong with using a professional English language, including jargon, rather than these sometimes highly and increasingly strange and, simply put, hard to understand sentences and paragraphs? I feel it comes from some sort of monopoly on information, but hope that I am wrong. Hope someone can help me.
