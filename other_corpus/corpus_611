My family has a 150 gb per month data plan for 3 people. We often times max out our data shortly before it renews every month. We live in a pretty rural area and we can't get a better connection than our current one. I've been wanting to buy and play the witcher 3, but I'm worried that installing the game and all the updates for the game will take a massive chunk out of our internet. How much data would it cost to install all the updates for either the witcher 3 base game or the ultimate edition on ps4 or xbone, and could I sustain that on my current connection.
