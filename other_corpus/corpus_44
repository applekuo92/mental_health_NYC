I was wondering the other day, if IMDbPro is worth subscribing. Anyone around here has a subscription? What kind of information do you have access to?

I know I can get that information on IMDb website, but I figured it would be better if I read some opinions of those who actually have a subscription on it, so they can share their experiences.
