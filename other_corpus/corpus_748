My mother in law decided to take a year off of work in order to finish a masters in nursing. During that year, she ran up about $50k in credit card debt. She has an income of about $80k/year and is barely making her minimum payments on her card. I'm trying to convince her to sell her rental house, which would give her about $45k in profit, but any advice is welcome. Are there any other options that we could pursue?
