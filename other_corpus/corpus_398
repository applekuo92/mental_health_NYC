In my history classes we were taught that life originated in the Fertile Crescent (somewhere around Baghdad, between the Tigris and the Euphrates, if I am wrong please correct me). That human life originated in the Middle East, where it was once known for its abundance of natural resources. Looking at it today, most of the Fertile Crescent appears to be arid, dry sand where not much will grow. This led some people to suggest that life, humanity as we know it, actually originated in Africa. (Where the origin of crazy shit like Ebola and Marburg came from).  

So my question is: in today's society do we believe life came from the Middle East or from Africa? And if from the Middle East, given the climate and the desert, can we infer that all fertile lands will inevitably become stretches of empty desert?
