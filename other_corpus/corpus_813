And this redhead comes in. After checking out a few items, the redhead sees what looks like an extremely old dollar coin selling for $15,000. The redhead takes a very close look at the coin and sees that it is a fake. She goes up to the blond and tells him about this, and he dismisses her. 

She responds, "I've got a Ph.D in American Studies. I could expose this shop and it would really affect you." He goes inside to discuss this with his wife, then comes back and says, "Alright, thanks for letting me know. You can take any item of your choice for nothing, just don't mention about the coin to anyone. I'll need your card so that I can charge it the minimum amount." It's a deal. She comes back with a set of coins worth $120,000, and he 'charges' her card. She leaves.

He goes back in to meet his wife. She asks,  "Do you really think this was a great idea?" He responds, "Yeah, she's gonna get crushed by the tax."
