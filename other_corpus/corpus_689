When we eat, say, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, some of us might be able to handle 4-5 before starting to get that nauseous "sick" feeling that we need to stop. How exactly does our body know it is getting too much sugar and "where" does this physical sensation originate? (The best I can explain the sensation is that the "gut" seems to feel nasty)

Also, how is it that some people like [Matt Stonie] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBlMl9BOanY) can destroy a dozen of these doughnuts without even a hint of feeling sick? Is he missing some kind of signals/receptors in his body?
