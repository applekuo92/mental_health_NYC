were the same one from Harry Potter.  I used to love Clash of the Titans, the original 80s version not the reboot.  I also knew Maggie Smith had appeared in other movies before Harry Potter including one where she worked on film with Daniel Radcliffe before Harry Potter. But I never realized that she was also in Clash of the Titan.

I was just watching it and it kept nagging me that a certain goddess seemed familiar so I had to hit IMDB to see who she was. Maggie Smith.

I am sure I missed a few other actor connections between older films and newer films. What about you guys?
