This is in response to a comment that was made exactly one year ago by /u/Alienm00se:

He speculated that the market is headed for a crash, and it was a good idea to sell out of large caps over the next year and start investing in hedge positions to shield against the crash. He also speculated that gold is going to possibly drop to $850/ounce, and it would be a good buy when it drops below $1050. I set a reminder to see where we are a year later.

Well, guess what happened? No surprise here. 

The closing price of the S&P 500 on 10/21/2015 was ~~$2018~~ $2052. 

The closing price on 10/21/2016 was $2141.

The S&P 500 is actually up ~~6%~~ 4.3% even after the tumultuous roller coaster ride we've had this year. Certainly, ~~6%~~ 4.3% pales in comparison to the raging bull market we've had where we've seen it soar 20% in one year. However, it is still a decent return. Periodically selling off during the past year would have resulted in missing out on those gains as well as possibly locking in some losses since we had a few months where the market fell and then rebounded.

[Gold did not go below $1050 once all year. The lowest it was all year was exactly $1050.80 on Dec 17, 2016.](http://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html) Today it is $1266. That being said, [I still do not recommend gold as an investment](http://www.aaii.com/files/images/articles/9298-figure-1.jpg).

[The most prudent advice is, as Warren Buffett recommends, invest in low-cost index funds, and invest long term.](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/08/10/why-warren-buffett-thinks-putting-your-money-her-2.aspx)

Your buddy who's got a hot stock pick? Forget it. Some conspiracy theorist on reddit says the market is overvalued and headed for a crash? Not a chance. Buy index, hold long, don't try to time the market.

EDIT: I had the original value wrong. It was $2052, not $2018.
