So we have eliminated our high-interest cc debt. We have 1k in emergency fund (easily accessible) and 2k in cds for emergency fund. 

We own our cars. I work very part-time and go to school. I will have my BSN in May 2018. Husband works FT and is in Navy reserves.  We have a 3yo. 

We owe 94k on our mortgage and still have PMI. We need to pay down an additional 9k to get rid of PMI. 

Hubby has about 80k in low interest school loans. 
I have about 25k in low interest school loans.

We have little savings as we traditionally spend what we make but we/I am trying to change that. 

Husband is currently deployed so making more $ than usual for 6 more months but his salary will return to normal after that. 

What should we do with the "extra" income over the next 6 months? It will work out to be around $40k.
