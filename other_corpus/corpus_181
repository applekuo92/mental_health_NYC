When Caleb's first watching the video of the sessions with the old AI's... the bit just before the robot is banging its hands against the door until the shatter off - why does he say "Jesus Christ!"

He's only seen a pair of legs being built up, and then Nathan trying to get the robot to write, then picking it up off the floor in the next room for some reason. Did they cut something?

I *think* it was him witnessing abuse - but nothing in the scene looked like abuse.
