The last text I got from a friend was his account number. He needs 1000 baht which i guess is around $20-$30. I've never wired money before, but when I tried to do it on Chase, it says I need his address. Unfortunately, I think my friend needs the money to pay off his wireless bill because he's not texting me back his address. Is there a way to wire money without his address?
