I'm taking a painting class this semester and my professor is very much into the abstract-ish style of painting - lots of shapes, random colors and scribbles, photographs with circles painted over people's heads, really angry looking slashes of paint, etc. Here are a few examples that I remember from class [1](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/8e/a9/98/8ea998552cd40d164efb1bc53fb68127.jpg) [2](http://www.welcomestranger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_2014-01-06-07-31-17-1.png) [3](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o68Jq4UhWbs/Sh1BEg6ouLI/AAAAAAAADd4/GsY68h6mwrs/s400/arss_john_baldessari_08_h.jpg)

The issue is that... I don't think I really understand abstract art. When I look at it, I think it's interesting and all, but I don't feel impressed or awed by it like I do other paintings. However, I really need a good grade in this class! As trivial as this may sound to some people, I can't afford to have this impact my gpa (I'm applying to med school next year). 

So my questions are - can anybody help me understand what's so great about abstract art? How do you create abstract art? Can you "plan" your abstract art, or does it have to be more spontaneous? I like to work mainly with watercolor, and I'm also studying abroad so I don't want to go and buy oil/acrylic tools - so is it possible to create good abstract art with watercolor, given that I feel like it requires a little more planning? 

Also, I'd love to discuss this topic of having somebody tell you what kind of art to make. I feel like maybe students need to be told, in order to expand their horizons or whatever? but at the same time, this sucks so much and all I want to do is paint what I like without worrying about my grades! I think it's very anti-art to try to force yourself to paint things you don't want to paint.
