Go to netflix(USA) and open up Burn Notice Season 4 Episode 19. Fast Forward to 7:58 and its the rock and roll song in the background. You only hear about 30 seconds of it.
I need help identifying this song. No matter what I tried shazam, music identifier, etc, I was never able to identify this song, and if you can please share the title and author of it with me.
