Basically,this book has a shady organization with crazy powers, a bunch of alien beings and a bit of amnesia thrown in for fun,whats not to like? Quentin Drake wakes up in a strange hospital with no memory of who he is and why he has a bunch of injuries(kinda like Jason Bourne).However,where this book differs from the Bourne series is that here we have a bunch of people called The Community,who have access to artifacts that endow the user with strange powers(like mind control or turning metal into rubber).Quentin has to try and get his memory back, and try to figure out why his friend died with sand stuffed inside his guts.All while the Community and a bunch of mysterious killer beings are trying to stop him.
