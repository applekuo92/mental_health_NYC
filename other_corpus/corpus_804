**Facility Log**


**Monday 10/17/16**- 4 AM: Today is my first day back since the.. uh, incident that happened last week. It's been uneventful, as it would happen both my co-worker and I are a bit less excited for the facility walks. During our first facility walk we discovered nothing out of the usually, although we did steer clear of the area of the building where we had the unpleasant experience that seems so fresh in my mind.


**Wednesday 10/19/16**- 5 AM: My co-worker and I have decided to enter the decrepit part of the facility, we have no choice due the fact that there seems to be a door open in that part of the facility. I wince as we pull the double-doors to the forgotten facility open, the smell of fresh and cool October air hits my nostrils and brings my nerves and my guard down. We pass through the doors that almost seem like a gateway to a different dimension. I flip the light switch, nothing happens. "Huh, that's odd. These worked less than a week ago." We pull out our mag lights, the click of our buttons is audible but no light emits from the flashlight. We pull our phones from our pockets only to find that they aren't working as well. A sudden flicker and suddenly everything comes to life, our flashlights, the florescent bulbs and the pinging of incoming messages vocalize from our devices. The door to the offices comes open slightly and then closes. We close the garage door that was left ajar and go back to our offices without any event.


**Friday 10/21/16**- 4:30 AM: An odd fixation to inspect the empty facility overcomes us, we wonder back into the place that we've had so many experiences. We find nothing out of the ordinary and we head back to our office. My co-worker excuses himself to the restroom and I continue my work on the facility log and a few signs that need to be posted throughout the facility. An email comes through, it's from my co-worker in the restroom. It's five pages of signs with the attached message to print them. I do exactly that. My co-worker comes back from the bathroom "I printed those signs that you wanted posted." He tilts his head in confusion. "I didn't send you anything to print, I haven't even drafted the signs yet." He lifts the freshly printed signs from the industrial printer. "Uhhhhh, you should look at this." I walk over to the printer and take a look at the signs, the first sign was normal. "Do not leave doors open." every sign after was far from normal, each with the message. "It watches" and a shadowy figure hidden behind the message. "Is this your idea of a sick joke, you dingus? This isn't a thing that we should joke about." He looks at me devoid of all emotion and flush of color, "I didn't make these at all, this isn't something I'm just having a joke about. I know nothing about these."

**Saturday 10/22/16**- 5 AM: I work alone tonight, my co-worker is enjoying the day off and I'm here writing this facility log. A open canvas for me to compose my thoughts and events of the night. My co-worker walks into the room, "What are you doing here?" I ask him. "Just collecting some stuff that I left in my locker." He grabs a few trinkets from his locker tells me to have a good rest of my shift and leaves. I notice that he's left his keys here and text him teasingly that he won't be able to drive home without them. He calls me back "What the hell are you talking about? I've been home all night." I freeze in total confusion. "Do you have your car keys with you? I ask him. "Of course you dunce, my car is parked out front." I ask him to check anyway. "I can't find my keys anywhere, but my car is still out front.. hold on, it's on right now. The lights are on." I scramble for the keys on my desk and find that they indeed have my co-workers beloved school grad keychain on them. I inform him that his keys are with me. "Impossible, my car is running out front" He walks out to his car to see if anyone is in it, the second he opens the door it shuts off. He informs me that no one is in the car and his keys are no where to be found. The call goes silent and the phone call drops.
