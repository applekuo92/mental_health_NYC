The conclusion was, that everybody only acts in his personal interest. Humans teach each other the goal is to gather and control as many resources as possible. Maybe it could be called "ego" is the problem ? However, I have not yet figured out why evolution came out this way. Why did evolution not lead to humans that act with the global well-being, including nature, in mind. I believe that this could accelerate the development of mankind much more.


We would not have the financial industry that produces nothing and only drains resources, pharma would not try to sell useless medicine and hide side effects, there would be no companies trying to make money by cutting down the rainforest or overfishing the oceans and risking mass extinction. There would also be no debt and interest based money system which benefits only a few and we would not need to waste resources on military and wars.
