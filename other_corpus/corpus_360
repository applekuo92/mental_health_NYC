I am in a very tight pickle. I want (and have wanted) to fly a 3'x5'  flag in front of our house but the 2 standard methods are not allowed (rental).  
  
I can't dig a hole in the lawn to bury a pole or drill any holes in the eve's of the roofline to hang the flag, per requirements of the lease/owner.  
  
I am in need of creative ideas on how to be able to fly Old Glory without causing an issue with my lease agreement.   
  
A few ideas I've thought of are:  
5gal bucket w/ cement and guy wires to hold down pole.  
Fashion a clamp out of 2x6's and lag bolts to clamp onto the eave to give me something to bolt a pole to.   
Don't know about the practicality of either, but in my head they sound good.
