Hello readers, and welcome to our weekly thread for images, videos, and gifs related to books. If you want to share an interesting youtube video you found, a picture of your bookshelf that you just reorganized, or a gif with books in it but don't have a thought provoking question or opinion to share along with it, you can post it here. 

Note: the rule about self promotion still applies, so while you are welcome to share a video you saw and loved on youtube, please don't spam with your own channel. 

Also, if you like what you see on this thread, be sure to check out book-related, image-oriented subs like /r/bookcaseporn[1] , /r/bookhaul[2] , /r/bookshelf[3] , /r/discworldtattoos[4] or /r/literaturevideos[5] throughout the week.
