Hey
Could you give me some recommendations for movies which go along the lines of yip man, the Kung Fu series or mb even The Last Samurai. I have watched close to none of these fighting movies meaning I'm kind of a newbie and don't even know the famous ones. Just give me everything you have. Thx have a nice evening
