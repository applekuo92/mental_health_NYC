The last time I had sex was 2 months ago, before my last period and I had an IUD at that time. However, at the end of my last period a month ago, my IUD ended up coming out. 

...And now my period is 6 days late.
I've tested 8 different times (the most recent being two days ago) and they've all been a hard negative.

Should I be freaking out or is this normal? I'm deathly afraid of being like one of those girls in "I didn't know I was pregnant" and suddenly popping out a "miracle" baby.
