Predator. Aliens. Terminator. They Live. The Hitcher. Assault On Precinct 13. Evil Dead 2.

What was it about the 80s that led to all these action flicks with great horror elements, and horror flicks with great action scenes? You'd think the two genres would go together like peanut butter and chocolate but the only movies I can think of off the top of my head that aren't deliberate retro throwbacks (like The Guest and Death Proof) would probably be Dog Soldiers, the first Resident Evil flick, World War Z, and possibly The Purge.

What led to this renaissance? Aside from a general aversion to risk-taking in today's Hollywood, is there any reason why we haven't seen much of a return to this style?
