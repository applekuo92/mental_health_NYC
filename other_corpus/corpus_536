I noticed that no one seems to have mentioned the (Carnegie medal winning 1996) YA book 'Junk' by Melvin Burgess, and was really surprised as it is possibly the most haunting and engrossing book that I read as a young teenager. 

Set in/around Bristol UK during the 1980s, against a punk culture backdrop, it tells the stories of a small group of young teenagers who get caught up taking heroin as runaways. It absolutely blew me away when I first read it at 13 - the accessible writing style, the heart breaking subject matter and characters that will always remain with me. 

Least of all, aiming such brutal subject matter at children I always though to be very daring. I remember the book being passed around secretly when I was 11 or 12 by other kids as parents were often put off by the front cover (featuring a syringe). Burgess grants his younger audience great respect by not sugar coating or sheltering them from the brutal realities of the subject matter, and I remember really appreciating that as a child.

I was wondering if anyone else has read this book, and whether it was more a British thing? What did you think of it?
