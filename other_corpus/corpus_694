So I was walking through the park with my father, and we saw two dogs humping, so I asked "Papa, what are they doing?"  "Making a puppy" he responded.

A few hours later it was my bedtime, and all I could think about was the dogs humping, so I went to talk to my father.  When I went downstairs I discovered my father on top of my mother.  "What are you doing to Mom?" I asked.  "Making you a baby brother." said my father.  I responded "No, flip her over!  I'd rather have a puppy."
