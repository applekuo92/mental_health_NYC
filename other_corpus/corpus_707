I took a job in a different state (CO) but am planning on moving back (to AZ) at the end of this year. I was here the beginning of August and will be here til the end of December. When filling out tax paperwork for the company I put the family member's address that I'm staying with in CO, so I'm wondering if I completely waived my residency by doing this.

I kind of looked through some various schools websites to see their take on it, but it seems like it heavily relates to "intent" which I feel they could skew either way.

Did I give up residency by taking a job in a different state and putting that state's address on my employment paperwork? Thanks!
