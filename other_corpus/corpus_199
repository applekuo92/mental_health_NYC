Over the past few years, I have had had an incessant itch on the lower portion on my sack. Without thinking about it, I would just scratch it. Sometimes it would hurt because the skin down there  is thin and I probably caused small tears with my scratching. 

I have been single for over 2 years and I just stated dating an amazing woman. To be sure I am ready for our "special dates," I took out a mirror to make sure that everything was kosher with the equipment. To my dismay, the lower portion of my sack now looks very blotchy. 

I hope my new girlfriend is not too overly freaky so that we can have tame sex for the first few times so that she doesn't have to look down there and discover my disturbing surprise. 

TL/DR: I have blotchy ball sack due to aggressively scratching over a period of a few years. 

LPT: Never "scratch your nuts," pinch and roll instead.
