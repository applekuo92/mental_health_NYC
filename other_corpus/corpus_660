I know we can induce visual experiences in people who already have a functional visual system, [for example, in this subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwOoqkLwL40), or those who had a functional visual system but lost some functionality due to disease or injury. However what I am unaware of, is if it's possible to induce visual experiences in individuals who have been blind from birth, e.g. those that have no eyes, via stimulating or inducing the relevant activity in their brain.
