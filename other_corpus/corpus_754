Explain the cosmetic and biological rejuvenation tech advances that will allow senior citizens to pass for college students.

Having volunteered in nursing homes, that advanced aging shit scares me. I don't want any part in looking so fucking old.

Thankfully, I'm young enough to probably see looking like senior citizens get obsolete and become one for the history books. But will someone explain *how?*

How will it be that I'll look the way I was in 2019, in 2079?
