I had a Lasik consult yesterday and am pre-emptively scheduled for the $4000 procedure next week. I have the cash,  but it's my entire emergency fund so I'd rather open a 0% APR Care Credit Line and pay it off in 18 months. The procedure is not covered by my insurance and I do not have an HSA.

I am almost legally blind so I'd love to do the procedure ASAP and be able to see like a normal person!  

Is the procedure tax deductible in the year it is performed, or the year it is paid? I will not be itemizing on my 2015 return, but will be on my 2016 return and if I pay off the Lasik completely next year, will have the 10% of AGI to itemize.

Is there anything else I'm not thinking of?
