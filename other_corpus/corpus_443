So I live in Latvia and I'm finishing my major (English Philology) right now. I speak Latvian, Russian and English fluently; I have a fairly good knowledge of Swedish and I can *understand* a dozen of other languages. I also can do pretty much anything that requires mental work if I'm mentored on the subject. 

That being said, I've been struggling to find a job for months already. 99% of available jobs are IT based, and when I went to a job fair, 100% of employers were seeking for IT people. Ugh. 

Of course, there are companies working with languages, but there are so many people in our country speaking English/Russian that employers don't give a damn about the fact that my language competence is a bit higher than that of an average JƒÅnis. 

As concerns translation agencies, the amount of money they pay... ugh, McDonalds pays more. 

And as for teaching someone, everyone looks for native speakers and don't even want to consider someone who's not. 

I'm anxious about the whole thing and I've lately been considering moving to Sweden or even the U.S. (or basically anywhere I can get a job lol, nothing's holding me back here), but I feel like I won't find anything but IT there as well (the more so when google finally finishes their "machine translating" project). 

Someone might say "but hey just learn programming", but I don't like that. I've taught myself the basics and I don't enjoy it.

Right now it feels like all I did was just postponed my job application to some UK factory by 4 years. 

Are there any other options for me?
