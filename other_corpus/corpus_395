It's only a matter of time right? It seems the internet loves ripping on millennials (or at least enjoy the subject of it, regardless of how they actually feel about them) so eventually some big-wig executive will get an idea and make it.


I'm guessing it'll be as 'funny' as The Big Bang Theory with a varied cast of white people (and their one black/gay/foreign friend) as they struggle with living on their own for the first time. 

Watch them struggle with the concept of cooking, the labours of laundry and the joy of job-hunting. It'll be basically be The Sims: The Series.
