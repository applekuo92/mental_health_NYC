Johnny was sitting in class and after everything the teacher said he'd reply "how bout that". "2x2 equals four" said the teacher, "how bout that" said Johnny. "In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue"  the teacher explained "how bout that" said Johnny. Well it wasn't long and Johnny was sent to the hall. After a while the teacher went out to get him and asked Johnny if he had learned his lesson. "yes said Johnny and I wrote a poem while I was out here" The teacher wanted to hear it and so so Johnny recited "when I was in the hall I saw a cockroach go up the wall" . That's very good said the teacher I would like you to recite your new poem to the class, but leave the cock out it's offensive. Soon Johnny was standing in front of the class and he began his poem "when i was in the hall I saw a roach go up the wall, with his cock out. How bout that!"
