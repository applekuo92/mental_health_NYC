So....im redoing my basement. There is, what i call a "modified pittsburgh bathroom" downthere. The pittsburgh toilet is just a toilet in the middle of basement. Ha. My basement has a full bathroom. The walls are painted cinder block. Right now the shower is 3 cinderblock walls and a somewhat sloped painted cement floor. It just has a 6in floor drain....the same as a normal basement floor drain. My question in this....can i tile right over the block and the cement floor and find a drain cover to fit. Or will i run into problems with any water that gets between the tile and the cinder block. Thanks in advance.
I can post pics when i get home if that would help
