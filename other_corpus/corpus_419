There seems to be a real lack of lan gaming cafe's in London (probably good reason too).  Maybe they generally aren't done well, but just wanted to get a feel for how popular this would be.  

I'd try and make it more of a immersive social experience with tournaments, players of the week,  start players displayed on a big main screen and awards given out.   

No COD players allowed, obviously :)
