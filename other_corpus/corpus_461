So far, I am very impressed by graphic style and overlay. They really outdid themselves with animations and lighting effects. The combat animations are VERY fluid, especially watching horsemen mow down infantry and spearman poke scouts and flip them over!

I'm loving the government system too, the card system is very neat and more fun to micro manage than social policies.

Also...Sean Bean.

Some great features from Civ 5 are missing, tourism doesn't seem to provide any bonuses beyond accruing a cultural victory, religion seems more basic without founder belief bonuses (could be wrong about this), and tooltips seem somewhat lacking (you need to go to the civpedia to remember what wonders you have do).

As with Civ 5, I'm sure we'll see things more fleshed out with expansions.
