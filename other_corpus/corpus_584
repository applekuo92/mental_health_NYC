Looking to finally begin investing after much anticipation. I am a 22M. 1 year away from graduating in Biochemistry. Debt free. Making $1800 per month. Expenses total out to about $800 per month. Emergency fund made and a few thousand in savings. 

What should my portfolio look like? My goal is more long term investing as I am not in need of immediate or short term money. As I find a more long term job I will obviously look into a 401k with matching options. Should I consider an IRA and bonds now or go for a more high risk strategy in the market? Percentages would help a lot too. (80% stock, 10% bonds, etc)

Thanks, guys!
