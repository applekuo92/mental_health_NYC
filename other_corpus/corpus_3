Ask more questions than you make declarative statements.


Debates: If you spend more time asking questions than answering, who works harder to justify their perspectives you or your opposition? Do you want to levy disagreement without seeming pushy or brash; how could break down the points you disagree on while remaining open to input? Want someone to stop and seriously consider a point; how might you phrase that point to accomplish that goal?


People: Want to establish a rapport with someone, help them to remember you, or get information from them; what could you do conversationally to give them a positive impression or find out something from them? 
 

Work: Want to show your boss you're interested in their input, you want to do better, and are invested in things other that collecting a check? How would you most simply communicate this initiative to them? Want to show your employees you care about them as people and about their ideas, their concerns and needs? How might you elicit conversations on these points?


Women: Want a woman to take you seriously as personal prospect? How might you earnestly demonstrate how seriously you take her as a person & prospect (in that order)?


Boss: Want to generally be a boss in all social settings and engagements? How might you go about that?


Genuine people genuinely like it when you ask them about their thoughts and ideas, disingenuous people are disingenuously indignant about being questioned; might this be a useful social cipher?


If I went to fast for anyone, please, don't hesitate to ask questions.

EDIT: The above is an illustrative -- don't actually go around trying to be the Riddler. In conversations/arguments/etc. simply try to ask MORE questions than give declarative statements; most people can't actually ask that many questions in a row, it takes practice, but in conversation there will always be a back and forth.
