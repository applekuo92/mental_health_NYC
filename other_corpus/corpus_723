For me my favorite time online was on Killzone 2 on the PS3 it was during a moment in high school were I was maturing different friends, stuff like that so I always played games alone. Killzone 2 is what I want battlefield online to feel like a big map but not huge it is now, tons of choke points/ mini full scale battles that basically get really hectic. I always thought the medic was the best class in the game, but at such an early age I didn't really heal much, mostly myself . I can't get that feeling from an online game anymore and he makes me sad a bit, i guess that means I'm maturing more or getting older my taste in gaming is changing. I just wish they would remaster it though it seems like Gorilla games has gone down in quality lately with the latest killzone . 

Edit: Also really excited to play CoD4 again. They should've just released CoD4 again for PS4 instead of this new CoD.
