So I'm going to start out by saying that this story terrifies me. It's not a very long story but I was told it when I was very young, so it freaks me out just the same.

So, when my grandma was a little girl she used to get these... feelings. For a long time she would only get good feelings before something good happened to her or her family, and then she started getting bad feelings. The first one she had was a few days before her mother was due to give birth to twins. 

The next day her mother went into labor and was rushed to the hospital. The feeling was making her shake back and forth, and she was crying while in the hospital waiting room. When her brother asked her what was wrong she couldn't explain what was wrong. The twins both died hours after being born.

My Grandma brushed it off as anxiety about the prospect of having two new siblings, and went on as usual. Then a few years later on a snowy, icy Sunday in December (we live in Wisconsin by the way) her family was all piling into the car to go to church, when she was struck with the worst feeling she had ever felt. It was a feeling of impending death. She screamed and cried and begged her family not to get into the car, and she refuses to get in. She was telling them they were going to die if they went out on the roads that day. 

Eventually her mother forced her to get into the car. She remembered saying, "Well I guess I'll meet Jesus today", in exasperation.

Her family didn't die that day, but when she got to school the next day she learned her best friends mom died in a car crash around the same time she had the feeling.

This is where she lost her power. She said it scares her so much she started going to church more and more and focusing on God and that her feelings slowly went away. To this day she strongly believes that the feelings were from the devil, and that she's better off without them.
