I don't imagine it was a picnic for them but we all know a lot about the British and the German side of things and it seems that people overlook Austro-Hungary's contribution in World War 1. 

Does anyone know what it would've been like to be an Austro-Hungarian soldier in World War 1? Did they do anything differently to other nations? The fact that they were basically two nations in a single army possibly meant that a language barrier could've existed depending if they would have Austrian's and Hungarians in the same group. Or was it always Austrians and Hungarian's being separate?
