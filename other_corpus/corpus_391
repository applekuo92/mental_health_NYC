My current job does a 4% match but you only get to keep the money after 3 years. I don't plan on being there for that long. Should I even both to put money in? I'm 26 and my wife is 23 with a household income of about $40,000. My wife and I save on our own. We take out 5% of each paycheck and put it manually into our savings account (an account that we don't touch for anything). 

If I won't be meeting the requirements to take the company contributions with me, should I just keep doing what I've been doing or start contributing towards it? We started saving about 3 years ago and are at about 15k in savings so far. I would like to increase that with employer contributions but I have to find a place I would like to stay at long term. Plus I like the security that if we ever REALLY need to money (emergency, etc) we can get it within a couple hours. At some point we'll have both. A small emergency fund (couple thousand bucks), a bigger retirement savings account, and a 401k with an employer.

Thanks for reading.
