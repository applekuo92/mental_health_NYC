Dear Reddit,

My grandmother is the trustee for her grandchildren's inheritance that is coming from her Mother's estate. She's looking for options on how to invest the inheritance because the money is not to be dispersed until the grandchildren are 25 years of age. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to go about investing the money?

Thanks!
