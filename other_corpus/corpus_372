Hesitation is the enemy. In any given action, it messes with our rhythm and flow. In social interaction, it makes us prey to dominance. It makes us seem less trustworthy, less assertive, and submissive.
Never anticipate failure. You have to push those thoughts out of your head as you focus. Our anticipation of failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, not for some mystical reason, but simply because the hesitation inhibits performance(in whatever context). And in more extended situations, we stop taking steps toward success when we've stopped to feel bad for ourselves.
The broaden and build theory of positive emotions also supports the notion that hesitation and fear prevent us from successful endeavors, from the smallest to the largest. The broaden and build theory states that positive emotions expand one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Negative emotions have the opposite effect. These effects aren't just general, but apply to specific physical tasks and mental agility especially.
Eliminating hesitation, and fostering a positive attitude only serves to decrease anxiety and increase performance. The effects of eliminating hesitation alone should create a feedback loop that improves your mood, which spills right back into the feedback loop.
Moral of the story, the power of positive thinking is real! More so, the power of negative thinking is greater!
