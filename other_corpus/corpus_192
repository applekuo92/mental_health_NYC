My wife and me are looking to build a college fund for our newborn nephew.  We've talked to a bank, and they seem to think a "trust fund" set up under an EIN would be the best option, as a 529 would not work appropriately with the funding he might receive from FAFSA.

Background info to help with some decisions:
I'm 32, my wife is 29, our yearly income is about 165k not counting bonuses.  Lots of job security, promotions not impossible.  We're 7 years into owning our first home which will be paid off late 2024.  We have no children, just animals, and are not going to be having children.  
My sister & her partner are mid-twenties, working in restaurants full time and able to rent a nice apartment.  Their yearly income is ~75k joint with tips.  They intend to have at least one more kid in the coming years, and both are hoping to go back to school over the course of the next few years.

In a dream world, they would both get promotions or their dream career out of college.  I'm worried that making a 529 would ruin his chance of FAFSA, which from what I am told would cover a pretty large chunk of his loans.  

Our bank suggested talking to an attorney and making a EIN/Trust fund set up for him, so that it will not affect his FAFSA loans.  A 401k was also mentioned however it didn't sound like an option that was "best" for everyone.  

I'm looking for opinions on what the "best" course of action would be here?  I am looking to put 5-8k away per year for him.  And if he chooses a trade school or something else, the money could be used elsewhere.  I would also like constraints, because I am okay with my sister having the ability to put money in, and see what is in there, but would like a "safety" to avoid any possible issues.

Sorry for the mess here, it's a lot more confusing to do this then I thought it would be, and googling for this information was not any help.
