Hello fellow double-Xers, I need advice and wasn't sure where to go.

I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend yesterday, and took a morning after pill today at about midday with no issues. I went back to the boyfriend's house later on (about 3pm) and had sex again, this time with a condom, but it broke! I've tried searching the internet but couldn't find any answers, do I need to take another pill, or will I be ok with the first one? I know it takes about two hours for the medication to be fully absorbed and start working, so I'm unsure about this 3-4 hour window.

Sorry if this is not a great place to post this, I just wasn't sure where to go. If you know any other places/subreddits where I should put this question, please let me know. I appreciate your help friends!
