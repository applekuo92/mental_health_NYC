I have realized that I know very little about most historical things, and part of that is because textbook learning doesn't really grab my attention. The few historical fiction books I've read, however, really make the stories come alive and I'm able to remember it much better! 

I really don't care what historical event(s) it's about - anything to help me increase my knowledge would be great! I just want it to be well written, interesting, and historically accurate. Any suggestions? :-)
