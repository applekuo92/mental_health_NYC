I think I've fallen in love with Higuchi Ichiyo. If you're not familiar with her, she's a Japanese writer from the meiji era. She passed away very early in her life. Her only translated work is *In the Shade of Spring Leaves*. In includes a combination of her biography and auto-biography (an auto-biography of sorts -- she wrote a literary diary of her life). The second half of the book includes 9 short stories.
