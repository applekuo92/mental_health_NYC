The IRS withholding calculator says we'll pay less tax by filing two separate "Single" status returns than filing one "Married Filing Jointly" return. I don't mean "Married Filing Singly". I mean two returns with the "Single" status.

Is it legal to be married and file two separate returns with the "Single" status?
