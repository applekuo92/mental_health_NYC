I recently had my first soup dumpling today out of curiosity. (saw a lot of people try it and it looks and sounds delicious).

When I had it the soup was semi congealed and had floaty slimy bits in it. I assumed the soup would be clear. Was that normal for a soup dumpling? Or did that restaurant just make it their own special way?

I didn't really like the texture of the soup that's why I'm asking. If it was a thinner soupier soup (if that makes sense), I feel I would have liked it more, that's why I'm asking. 

PS. The dumpling and vinegar part was amazing.
