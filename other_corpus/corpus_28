2 of the 3 songs i've ever submitted here have been downvoted to 0. I don't mind that the songs i've written, recorded, and overall put a lot of work into might not be considered good, but having your post not making it past 30 minutes above 0 points kind of reduces its visibility. A lot.

I don't think I'm the only one noticing this either, considering a lot of posts I have looked at are showing the same results. Posts from other musicians that I've upvoted and interacted with also don't seem to make it past an hour of visibility at most (with exceptions of course).

Again, I don't mind if the general opinion is that I'm producing bad material. I just think the way this is working right now makes "Original Saturdays" kind of worthless for the entire sub.
