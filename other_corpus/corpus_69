For my entire life I've been ambitious but I have one serious problem that holds me back.

Whenever I achieve something big (although it's not always that big), I'm so happy and I feel so proud that I lose any motivation to do further work or improve myself.

I believe it is because I feel so important and feeling important is the main need of human.

I've been trying for few years to overcome this problem and I didn't succeed, help.
