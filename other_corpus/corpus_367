I personally believe that it should be possible to 100% complete a game for the first time without taking a single hit of damage. If you've read anything I've written on here before, you probably know that.

Now, this doesn't mean that I want games to be without challenge and that I want the game to be super easy. What I mean by this is, I would like to try and see if a game can be completed and challenging WITHOUT trial and error.

This is an example of trial and error. There are obstacles and harmful things in the game that you cannot possibly know or learn about until it's too late, and it has already hurt you. Not the player's fault.

Basically, this creates a punishment that wasn't really deserving. The game is punishing you for not knowing about it, despite the fact that the only way you could possibly know and learn about it is to have it punish you for such in the first place. In other words, punishment is unavoidable, making it less of a punishment and more of the game being a jerk to you.

I somewhat believe that the game should give you fair instructions and a proper method of teaching the player WITHOUT having the player taking damage from that. I don't believe players should learn that lava can kill them only by falling into it first.

The reason I believe that games shouldn't be made this way is, because it creates a more frustrating and unstable game the first time around. Sure, maybe the SECOND time around, you can play the game without taking a single hit of damage, but the first half, you're playing the game by running and testing each little piece of the game, and then using that for future runs.

So, what I'm trying to ask is, is it even possible to create a fun and challenging game without the need of trial and error?
