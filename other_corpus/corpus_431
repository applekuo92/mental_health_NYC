When I was very young, I remember playing through Ocarina of Time. At the very end when you had to fight Beast Ganon, the cutscene that shows after the castle collapses and he shoots up from the rubble and transforms, and then during the fight I just had intense chill bumps all over , then that final cutscene when Zelda holds Ganon down with the power of the sages and link delivers that final blow to Ganon's head, oh man, to this day still gives me chills. But however. This was not my first "emotional" memory from a video games. It was more like my first most intense memory. When I was in about 2nd or 3rd grade I believe, I had Star Wars: Republic Commando. I loved this game. In my young mind it was basically Halo but re-skinned as Star Wars (as I was a huge Halo fan). Anyway the game was amazing, and one character I had a strong tie with. Sev. The sniper. The Commando with a blood splatter hand print on his helmet. He was my absolute favorite. *Spoiler* at the very end of the game, when the team of commandos were being over-run by too many enemies and were trying to escape, Sev got left behind and said he'd meet them at the LZ (or something of the sort. I haven't played the game in quite some time). When the commandos almost make it to their exit, Sev comes across the scanner and says, "Guys...there's too many of them.. I'm not making it out of here, alive.. you'll have to go on without me." Immediately I was heart broken.. After fighting back and forth over the scanner, the Commandos realize there is no way to save Sev, so they leave. As a kid I hated this. I thought about Sev for the rest of the week and I talked with my friends at school about it and I remember them agreeing that it sucked lol so anyway. I was just wondering, what's you guys first emotional gaming memory?? (Sorry for the long post btw)
