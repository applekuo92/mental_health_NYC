All those adults doing boring stuff. In the end its all for our children! I want to see a two year old screeming about bedtime while doing quadruple somersaults. What toys will they play with? Magnets? Imagine being 10 years old again in a bouncy castle in zero G.

Thats an idea that science fiction left untouched. The fun of not having to care about crucial missions and honor and danger. Just a child running on the capsule walls playing catch screaming and laughing.

Can you imagine the fun of throwing those jumping rubber balls? What about rc toys? 

Please tell me what you would play in zero G. I can't stop daydreaming.
