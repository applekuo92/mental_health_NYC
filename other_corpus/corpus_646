[This is all from my dream]

The submarine is hard to destroy, so the advisor suggests to encapsulate it in eternal time-loop instead. From time to time the discussion is interrupted by yet another wave of zombies attacking the villain's base, so the villain and his advisor have to personally defend the base (probably due to lack of minions?).

Zombies have nothing to do with good guys from the submarine. During one of zombie waves the advisor recognises his own mother among zombies, but cold-bloodedly shoots her down with other zombies.
