What, in your opinion, would be the most intimidating World War tank? IMO, it would be the Mark V Male tank from late WWI (and small service in the German defence of Berlin in WWII in 1945). With two heavy cannons and machine guns, it's something I would not want to fight. 
Sidenote I'm just thinking as a general look at the tank. I'm not too worried about design flaws or performance limitations, I'm just looking at the broad view of the tank.
