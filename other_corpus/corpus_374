My girlfriend recently bought this $90 tub of hair product to use after a shower. It's been about three weeks of her using it, and **it smells fucking putrid.** Rotting fruit and a stale fart could almost describe it. I've mentioned I didn't care for it but she said it takes time to get used to and her hair to get used to new product.. A few days ago, I couldn't take it anymore. So I emptied out the tub and filled it with mostly just water and a small amount of her regular hair conditioner. After a shower, I watched her massage the stuff in her hair and I felt happy knowing my home wouldn't smell like a trash dump anymore. 
"My hair has finally gotten used to it!! It works great now. I'll definitely have to buy some more of this."
Ninety fucking dollars for the scent of butthole.

**Tl;dr Girlfriend buys bad hair product, I fill it with water because I hate the smell and she ends up loving my secret concoction so much that she plans to spend MORE MONEY ON IT.**
