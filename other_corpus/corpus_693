So I bought the Standerd edition of Gears of War 4 on the Xbox store, and In the description it says I will receive the whole gears of war collection in a message within one month of purchase on the Xbox store. How long did it take u guys to receive it? (Just purchased yesterday, just trying to see how long it takes.)
