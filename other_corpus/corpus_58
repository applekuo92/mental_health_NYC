I am a fairly squeaky clean new player to the battlefield universe. I have always liked first persons but never played battlefield at all. I have a high regard for WWI and lost it when I found out a new game was in the making. I preordered buy have been lookin into building a team. All if my mates are on steam and so being the only one who owns the game I wanted to see if any of you nice people wanted to have some fun together.
