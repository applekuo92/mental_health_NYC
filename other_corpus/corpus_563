If I could describe this book in one word it would be charming (no pun intended).  It is a story of a recently widowed man named Arthur Pepper who finds a charm bracelet that belonged to his wife as he sets out to discover the story behind each charm and the life his wife lived before they were together.  Main themes are love, loss, aging, surprise and fear. It was a terrific book that I could not put down.  It is a very easy read and one of the most uplifting stories I have read in a long time.  Definitely recommended.  "I do not want to forget the past, only to move on from it."
