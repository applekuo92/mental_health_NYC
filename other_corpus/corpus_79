I wanted to provide some films for some little little kids, but I want them to be super simple enough to follow (heck, when I was little, I couldn't even gather in A Bug's Life that the grasshoppers were forcing the ants to split their food), so what I'm looking for is something that expresses most of its simple concepts visually. 

Fantasia so far is the only one I've thought of.

Something black and white would be great to introduce to a young child as well. A silent movie in a Charlie Chaplin kind of spin.
