I despise tactical shooters with super high TTK. They all play the exact same to me for the most part. I like games with lots of movement. Gears of War, Unreal Tournament, TF2 scout etc. Way more high octane and skill based IMO.

Thing is I don't know a soul who plays on PC and the people who do have mics all sound like they've never been outside a day in their life so it makes me feel weird. I don't want to play with them.

Also the player base on these great games (UT2016, Quake Live, not sure about Toxikk) just seems horrendous. I'd probably also play L4D2. I hear DOOM MP is dead on PC. Not too much interest in single player games unless internet is out. I would play something like Fallout for that. I guess I could also look at halo online. I hear GOW4 is dead on PC.

What am I supposed to do?
