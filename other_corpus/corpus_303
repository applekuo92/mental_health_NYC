The starwars prequels are often heavily criticisized by fans as being horrible. To me at least, i think the story that they were going for seems to be actually more interesting than the originals starwars. It has politics,conspiracies, moral grays, love,betrayal. All of the characters seems to have the potential to be compelling, the doubtful jedi protagonist. A ruler in love with the potential villain of the story. The best friend mentor that loves the villain like a brother but is forced to kill him. The dark lord who acts like a puppet lord, weaving his plans in the most practical manner, playing both sides so he can win in many ways. The characters has serious potential.

Do you think it would be worth it to reboot the prequels, If yes, in what way will we do it?
