1st question: [This website](http://mriquestions.com/how-does-b1-tip-m.html) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKp67IqQjH4) show that the angle of precession increases when you apply the RF pulse. However, [Section 5.00 of this website](http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/chem605/) shows that the cone of precession flips but the angle doesn't change. Could someone please explain what exactly is happening to the net magnetization vector?

2nd question: [This website](http://mriquestions.com/off-resonance.html) says that if the frequency of the RF pulse =/= Larmor frequency then it would precess around the Beff axis in the rotating frame. Does it mean that in the stationary frame it's precessing in 2 axes (the z axis and Beff axis) at the same time?

Thank you very much.
