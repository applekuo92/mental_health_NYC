Whenever i hear about electric car charging stations, someone always suggests they wont be efficient unless they can charge much faster. I would like to know how they plan to improve the charging rates.

I would guess it depends on the leads of the battery in the car. For example if i buy a new electric car now. Does it have a max charge rate? Say 5 or ten years later much newer cars have faster charge rates for the batteries, and faster output for the charging stations. 

When a certain charge rate does become standard, for batteries and car chargers, will the slower batteries be left behind? Or can the batteries just accept whatever input speed they get from the charging station.

I guess the answer im looking for here is really: Which will determine how fast your electric car will be able to charge, the battery or the charging stations.

Thanks!
