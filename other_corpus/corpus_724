Hey all. I have been wanting to try making a detailed cast of a human skull for a while now, but cant find any good tutorials. I have done plenty of looking, but none are what I am looking for. I want to be able to cast and mold a human skull, while still being able to preserve the details in the final cast. More specifically, I want to have the hollow nasal passage, the optical nerve passing, etc. I know that I would have to rotocast to make it hollow, but dont know how to preserve the details. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
