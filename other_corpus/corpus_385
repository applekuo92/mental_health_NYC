I'm pretty sure this isn't the right sub but I don't see where best to post.

I'm looking for a film probably from the 90s about a guy who more or less trasforms into a very graphic power ranger. The whole film is very violent and very gory.

I think the main character who was charged could also rejuvenate his spikes and stuff.
