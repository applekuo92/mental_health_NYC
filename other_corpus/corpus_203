I had an idea for fallout 5, the idea is that you play the first half of the game in pre apocalyptica and the second half in apocalyptica, get to experience the great war, possibly as a soldier, battle radiation and in the end decided on which path you take end up as a super mutant, a ghoul, or as some sort of authority figure for a civilization.

This story would take place in California, and include many of the attractions of Cali. 

Maybe a prequel to the NCR or the BoS?
