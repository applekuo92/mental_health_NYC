TIFU last week, not today. 

It all started in my little flight abroad. I took business class and enjoyed the free food that came with it. With the amount I hate my ass was like a dam holding back my vast reserves if shit. 

I went to the bathroom to led it go, and damn, it shot out at power similar to a .50 cal. 

After letting my volcano erupt, I went to reach for the majestic ass spray... great. The water power was under 9000. Barley any water came out of the spray. Couldn't wash my ass with that, so like a North American, I had to use toilet paper only. 

I've only ever used toilet paper once before, and that was when some cunty kid broke the water sprays in the bathroom. So I wiped, and wiped my poor virgin asshole. I wiped with force. Too much force.

I probably wiped for what was 10 minutes because I wanted to make sure my precious asshole was clean, as water is a easier method to clean with.

Few hours later on the flight my asshole was itching... it hurt. It felt like ants were probing around there like poor Eric Cartmen in the South Park pilot. It felt like satan was tickling his pickle with my asshole.

After more unbearable itchiness and pain, I went to the bathroom to see the damage. It was a bit awkward tryna look down there, but it was red. It burnt. Trying to put cream there after the flight only lead to what felt like I was being fisted by satan himeself.

TL;DR I am not a good North American.
