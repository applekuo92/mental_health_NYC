I can't understand this game.

I see swarms of different resources: production, food, faith, policy...

And tons of numbers.


All I have to do with all that stuff is constantly click 'Next turn'. 

Some researches are being made, my soldiers pointlessly roam the map and I just hit 'Next turn' until the new research/production is ready, choose production... and then this 'Next turn'-spamming starts over.


What am I doing wrong?


I'm sure that's not the way this game is supposed to be played â€” but I don't know what else to do.
