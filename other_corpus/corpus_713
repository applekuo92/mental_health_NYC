Hi, I haven't played a battlefield game since 4 which I didn't really like, but I loved bad company 2 and battlefield 3, I have just about enough for one new game and although the reviews are looking great I was interested to hear what you guys think, I would only really be getting it for the multiplayer and will most likely be getting it on PC, thanks.
