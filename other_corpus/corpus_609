Given the current political climate in the United States, and the sheer volume of submissions that go against [Rule 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/about/sidebar), we are implementing a short-term policy: Any submitters who post political or politics-related content (as per [Rule 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/about/sidebar)) will be banned for seven days.
