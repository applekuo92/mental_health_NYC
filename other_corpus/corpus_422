Some backstory:

Currently, my work is offering me a health insurance plan that costs ~$50/month via HSA. I'm full time, and will be making ~$30,000 this year, and ~50,000 next year. 

Until now, I was always on my parents health insurance plan, and thusly, I want to shop around. I'm 21, not married male, and I don't get sick; I haven't been to a doctor or hospital within the last five years. I have a low risk job, and I'm in the prime of my youth, I just want to save as much money as I can knowing full well that I will not utilize the health insurance company in any way over the course of next year. 

In short, I need help finding the absolute cheapest premium on the  cheapest bronze health insurance plan that meets the U.S government's guidelines. My enrollment for my work ends in the next couple days, while shopping on nationally sponsored website healthcare.gov doesn't begin until the first. Any help would be both greatly utilized, appreciated, and passed on to the next future generation!
