I bought a crazy super deluxe pool noodle from costco for $18 when normally they are $50. My dog got a hold of it and ripped some off the nice coating on it and i dont know what i would need to repair it (stock is gone).

It would need to be waterproof flexible and non toxic  or sticky. Does anyone know a product that would work?
