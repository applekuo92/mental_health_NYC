... when the plane crashes, and they are stranded in some desert. Fortunately they survived with only small injuries. These Christians, John and Steve, start walking under the heat of the desert sun. After a few hours, they see a mosque in a distance. John wanted to make a plan.

**John**: Let's go to that mosque, disguise ourselves as Muslims, and asks the Imam to spare us some food and water. I'm gonna call myself Ahmed.

**Steve**: No, I don't want to disguise myself as Muslim. Sounds like a bad idea...

**John**: Alright... If you don't want to disguise yourself then fine. Let's just go.

John and Steve walk to the mosque. John opened the conversation with the Imam

**John**: Salaam Alaikum, Imam. My name is Ahmed. This is my friend Steve. We are travelers and our plane crashed...

**Imam**: MashaAllah! Come on in Brothers! Let me get your friend Steve here some food and drinks.

**Steve**: Oh my god, Thank you. Thank you very much!

**Imam**: ... and for you Ahmed...

**John**: Yes, Imam?

**Imam**: Ramadhan Mubaraak!
