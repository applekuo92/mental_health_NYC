Hello,

I applied for a auto loan for $6k at a credit union to buy a car from a private seller and got approved. I wasn't able to talk to the banker because he went home for the day when i tried to reach out to him. but since i was approved will the bank give me the $6k in cash to buy the car? or will it be some other method? just wondering because the person i want to buy the car from wants cash only.
