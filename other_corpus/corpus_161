Hello everyone.

I'm looking to start my own business. Nothing big. No employees. Just me, myself, and I. Just doing my work under a business name so I can be taxed correctly, and I can make write-offs.

I'm 25 and quite clueless about this stuff, and no one around me knows much about this. I'm also in NJ, USA, if that means anything different.

Please and thank you for all advice you can help me with!!
