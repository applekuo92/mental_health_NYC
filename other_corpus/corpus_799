I understand that sugar, though to some degree necessary in the diet for optimal health, is bad for you in excess. High sugar intake is apparently related to heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions. Fruit, however, is considered good for you, because of the many vitamins and minerals they provide. Fruit is also high in sugar (fructose?). Is this sugar still bad for you? How do the benefits of its nutrients and consequences of sugar compare to each other?
