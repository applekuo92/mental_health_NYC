I'm talking about smooth running, graphically amazing, flawless MMO/PVP, large scale gameplay. 

Please no EvE, I knows it is great but I have 2-3 hours every other day and I want new, beautiful, massive game play. Most recently I played/ragequit Archeage and play WarThunder and Planetside 2 (Live free or die), still, because they're great. Thanks!
