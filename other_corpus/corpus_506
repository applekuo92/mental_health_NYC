Obligatory "this didn't happen today, but it did just recently happen"

Short....well, it happened. I was eating my wife out in our dark bedroom, when I realized something didn't feel right with my front tooth [I have vinears up front]....ran my toung across my front teeth when I realized one of them cracked in half and I was missing the other half. SHIT!

So, I tried to inconspicuously look for it while continuing to do my husbandly deed down there without killing the mood, but couldn't locate it and had to turn the lights on and look for it because my fear of it getting lost deep inside her was growing. 

Needless to say, I jacked off that night.
