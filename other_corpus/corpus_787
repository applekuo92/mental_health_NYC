I'm looking for minimal but atmospheric techno albums similar to Microgravity by Biosphere. Something that has dance floor aspect with emphasis on fat, mesmerizing bass, but has nice textures and cold atmosphere too. Crude and hypnotic techno. Tech house will do also, but nothing too polished please.
