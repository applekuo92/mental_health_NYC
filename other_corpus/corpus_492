I've been a member at NECU(.org) since around 1998, I live in NH.  

Lately I'm getting very annoyed with their continued investing in placing ad's everywhere to generate membership, rather than having better savings rates or having better service for members. 

Would anyone have suggestions for other CU's in the area? Does longevity mean anything to a CU? Am I losing out in anything if I go to a different CU? Currently I have checking, savings, and a low interest cc with them. Rates on both checking and savings are near non-existent. 

Considering ServiceCU.org if that makes any difference.
