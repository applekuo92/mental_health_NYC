What is the perfect "finale" song for you? That is, a song that you think is the absolutely perfect credits song to a really wholesome movie, or the final song in an album which makes you shudder, or the song you are convinced will ring in your ears as you take your last breath?

My shortlist would consist of:

* **[Roy Buchanan - Sweet Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJqHrAvfckg)**. An instrumental blues piece featured as The Departed's credits song. Sorrowful but bittersweet, it sounds like a reflection on difficult times gone by.
* **[Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard - Now We Are Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xButjfhZWVU)**. This song was the theme song of the movie Gladiator. Sung in a "language" made up by Lisa Gerrard, it deals with the feeling of liberation and accomplishment.
* **[Chopin - Nocturne Op.9 No.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGRO05WcNDk)**. A Romantic era piano piece by the prominent composer Chopin. To me it almost feels like it plays out to the universe; a humbling piece of humble piano music. I absolutely love the pause between the first two notes.
