I used to play this mech game, your mech was blue, and could switch between a walker mode and a flight mode. Most of the time, you were in an arctic area, and one of the weapon was a continuous beam on top of your mech. I don't exactly remember when i played it, but it was around 2000. Anything comes to mind ? I remember having a crapton of fun despite not knowing the controls, but now i shouldn't have any problems with them.
