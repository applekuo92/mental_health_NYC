So Ive had my car almost 2 years now, but it seems like I have been upside down since I left the lot. Bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic last Febuary for 9600 or so abouts. I put $2500 down and I pay $199.24. I have only been late twice. Other than that all on time payments usually made before my due date.

But I find myself in the predicament of needing a bigger car now, so to trade it of course I need the payoff balance. Its currently about 7300 right now. I just need advice on what to do in this situation.
