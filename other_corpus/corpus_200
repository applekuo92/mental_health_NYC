Just like title says. What scripts or abandoned movies would you like to see turned into an animated movie or graphic novel. Personally I wouldn't mind seeing some of the Batman or Superman scripts turned into something. There are just way to many cool or odd scripts out there of Batman or Superman. So put what you wouldn't mind seeing.
