I saw the video the same as you guys yesterday day and I have to say I'm intrigued. I've owned many Nintendo handhelds over the years starting with the og gameboy. That said I've never owned a Nintendo home console and their exclusives besides Zelda haven't held the same charm and nostalgia that they have for others. I get on "the internet" after seeing the switch excited to see what other people think and am both surprised and a bit confused as to the amount of people excited to play third party games on the go like remastered skyrim(xbox360 skyrim I can see) and red dead 2. Everyone seems to expect this to be on par with the PS4 and Xbox with a minor deficit in power. I'm not sure we all watched the same video because what I saw was a small compact tablet. Does your iPad run skyrim and call of duty... no? Then don't expect this thing to. That said I expect this to be the most powerful gaming tablet available and tablets continue to amaze me with how fast they are catching up to consoles but I feel like they will always be a step behind simply due to size. One thing with gaming on tablets that I hate is touch controls and this device thankfully has controller support built in and I love that I have the option to play the games on my tv since most of my handheld gaming is at home on the couch anyway. Also I feel like I'm reading comments from the Wii U days all over again with people hopeful that third parties will flock to Nintendo because "this time" it will be better. I know that Nintendo made the comment that this is a home console first and for most and honestly I think they shot themselves in the foot with that. I look at this as a successor to the 3ds which I felt like was a poor half step up from the ds and I feel excited I like everything I see. I just think people need to manage their expectations with this and take it for what it really is nintendos next handheld that will play Nintendo ass games and it's cool.
