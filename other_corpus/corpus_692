I'll be early separating at the beginning of next year. Being that it's earlier than expected, I don't have much in savings at all. I was pretty terrible with saving the last few years, and I take responsibility for that. Anyways, my plan is to move to Chicago, and just rent a room for about $500, work and take a class before moving to San Francisco in the Fall to attend City College for a year before transferring. Though I don't have any savings, my GI Bill will be paying out nearly $40,000 in housing allowance my first year at City College. I'll be living in Student Housing, paying about $800 a month. My question is, would I be able to get a loan to cover my first year of rent, and first few months of random expenses before my GI Bill kicks in? Would this be advisable? Thanks for the advice, and let me know any other clarifications I can make.
