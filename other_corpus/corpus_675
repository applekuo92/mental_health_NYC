I am currently working on fixing up my credit, as quickly as I can, and I was wondering if it was worth writing a goodwill letter to Chase Auto. I have a 30-day late payment way back in 2013. The car has been paid off since July 2015 so it's a closed account.

Will creditors look at letters for closed accounts?

**Background for possible letter**

I had a bad year in 2014 with over 7 months of unemployment and my credit has taken a huge hit, but I've tried patching it back up. It was at a 502 and now it's sitting at 637 according to TU.

-I got an unsecured card and made on time and early payments for 2 years. I tried to keep utilization under 30%

-Paid 30k worth of debt in a year

-Had a charge off completely removed from my credit history

**Possible obstacle for Goodwill Letter**

I have another 120 day late account regarding my student loan payment...I buried my head in the sand when unemployed - Do not recommend this. I finally had the loan deferred for a few months then put it on IDR when I finally got a low paying job.

I was hoping to contact Great Lakes directly and see if they would be willing to take off the late account report if I signed up for auto-enroll...I'm not sure it that would work, though. Should I address this account before sending Chase a goodwill letter?
