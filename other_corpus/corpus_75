I feel like people mainly associate flasks with keeping drinks hot, even though most flask manufacturers also state how long they can keep drinks cold. 

Filling up a flask with water and a few ice cubes (or just a cold drink to start with) can keep your drink cold all day despite being handled. Much better than plastic bottles. Only drawback is flasks are a bit bigger than their plastic counterparts for the same capacity, so it might not be useful in every situation, but it's good for gym sessions, picnics etc.
