Most people who go into near death experiences describe it as "peaceful uninterrupted sleep with no dreams"

Idk about you but i know a few people who often say "i wish i could just sleep all week" 

Verdict: Id rate death 5/10.

While it does seem nice to just "let it go". Being alive is sensational. Pain, agony, suffering, be thankful for it (i guess). After all, if we dead we dont get that sweet sweet hot water in the shower.
