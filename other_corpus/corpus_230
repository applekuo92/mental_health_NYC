Don't know where to post. My recent marriage has completely broken down (couples counselling, separate bedrooms, sex once since the wedding, complete disconnect on all levels, he knows I want a separation) and I started a course in counselling and psychotherapy. Not the ideal time but I wanted to do it and it gives me focus. Anyway, we have small group projects.  So it's me and two guys doing a project. One guy is 14 years older than me (no biggie),  well-read, funny, has gorgeous hands, totally on my wavelength with the worldview. I have an absolute burning, yearning desire to be kissed by him. It's all-consuming. It's weird though, seeing as how I'm still married but am dying to feel this man's lips on mine. Have you ever felt this?Advice/thoughts/feedback welcome!
