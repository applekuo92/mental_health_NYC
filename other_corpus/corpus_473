I am the owner of a Vizio E320-B0 TV, and it's being less than cooperative with regards to legacy consoles. When I try to use my SNES or N64, I get an "Unsupported Mode" message- it doesn't happen with my Gamecube, luckily. This also doesn't happen on the Sanyo in the living room, although it looks awful since it's a 46". 
  
I need to get rid of the CRT, but I want to be able to play legacy consoles without the bullshit. What's going on, and how can I fix it? My best guess right now is a Composite>HDMI switch, since I tried a cable converter box and it didn't work.
