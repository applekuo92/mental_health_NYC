I'm a teacher in Illinois and this has and will be my only career. I plan to put in my 35 years of teaching and retire. Since I've started, I've been told not to trust the pension system and not expect my pension. This seems a bit of hyperbole. 

How do I evaluate the risk of the whole thing somehow going under? Or not getting a fraction of what was promised? I've put in 9% of my salary towards my pension every year (some people don't know this.) There have been several attempts to reduce pension benefits, but these have been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional as the IL constitution says you can't reduce a pensioners benefit. States can't go bankrupt, right? 

So right now I'm maxing out my Roth IRA and my 403(b), partially so that when I need more cash flow I can contribute less and partially because I know I won't get social security and if something happens to pension, I would be completely screwed if I had no other retirement savings. But now I'm worried I'll have the combination "problem" of having too much saved for retirement and not having as much spending money now. We live comfortably and within our means. 

My question (or in just interested in hearing people's thoughts on, as no one can tell the future) is: what are the chances of me not getting my full pension? Is it silly to save so much for retirement now and worry about the pension? Which would I regret more: saving too much now and paying the opportunity cost of not as much cash flow now, or not saving enough now and something happening to the pension when I want to retire?
