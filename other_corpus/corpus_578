Just looking for the specifics on how she should tackle this loan. I don't know all the information and she's being slightly fearful/ignorant about the details so here we go. 

Loan is about $5,000.

Loan has been defaulted.

She's been making regular payments again for a year and a half now.

Interest unknown. 

She does not own any credit cards and has no other debt.

My question is mostly about improving her credit score. Should she pay it off completely all at once? Should she keep making regular payments now to keep a recovering line of credit, (or will having this defaulted loan still active be worse for her credit)? Or (and this might depend on the interest) just pay off most of it and make regular payments for a year or 2 to keep that line of credit going?
