Following up in literally any capacity is easy, and really means a lot. Some examples: Did you help someone with an issue at work? A week later a quick email "hey just a follow up so I can scratch you off of my list. Is *issue* still working ok?" Or when I was working for myself as a field tech. Help a customer and do a good job, they'll remember you as good. One succinct follow-up call a week later and they'll remember you as stellar. The effort/return ratio here is astounding; it's so easy and it means so much to people. In my current capacity if I ever help ANYONE with an issue I always follow-up and I genuinely feel everyone appreciates it. Also, depending on your occupation of course, it can very often lead to more work, referrals, or promotions because it opens up the opportunity for such things and proves to people that you care about what you did for them.
