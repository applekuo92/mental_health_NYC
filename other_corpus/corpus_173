I'm on my phone so I'll try to make it short. My parents, dad being in his early 50s and mom in late 40s are worried that they have not really have a financial plan, as of now they live a lifestyle they can afford but if something was to happen theres no savings, no nothing. So since they paid off some debts and freed up money, instead of just putting it into a savings account, they came across Primerica and they are being sold their services, mutual funds, managed accounts, etc. Because a friend of them actually had apparent success with them and actually have received returns in their investment.


So I ask, are they about to get scammed or they are actually, besides the pyramid scheme of things, a viable way to have some sort of planning for the future? I also ask for myself because being 25, I don't have a plan, besides finishing school and finding a good job afterwards. 

I hope this is the right place and thanks in advance for any replies!
