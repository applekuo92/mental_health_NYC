I'm a year out of college and am almost at the point where I have my safety net saved up in a savings account. Once I have that saved up, I'm deciding between maxing out my 401k and saving for a down payment on a home, likely both. 

I want to save enough to avoid PMI, and I don't know whether I want a home in 1 year or 5 years, so I don't want to simply throw it all in a savings account. What's the best type of account to use for this situation? I need it liquid enough to be able to take it out with a few months advance, but want to earn money on it in case it sits there for 5 years. 

I'm earning $120k/yr pre tax. Hopefully I'll have the down payment saved up in the next year if that matters.
