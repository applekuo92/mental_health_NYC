So a few friends and myself decided to go see a movie,in the theater there was this couple, around the age of 18 or 19, before the movie they were they were messing around and the guy was trying to be cute and he said "baby you're one in a million"..........

I immediately responded with "statistically that means there's more of you"

She then looked at me, then looked at her date and said "he has a point, who else is one in a million to you huh!?"
10 minutes of arguing later she leaves, he chases after her and neither return for the movie.
