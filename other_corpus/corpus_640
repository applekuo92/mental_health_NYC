Hey, I'm rather new to reddit, and I just made an account so I could post somewhere that could actually help and NOT direct me to another forum where I "should post". Anyways, I've tried all the solutions to this error including updating my video drivers, updating directX, putting in all the launch commands, simply restarting the PC, using the windows compatibility troubleshooter, and even re-installing the game twice. None of it has worked, and its really annoying me since I'm an avid player. 
 
My most important specs are:
-Windows 10
-Nvidia Geforce GT 720 (Video Card)

Also, whenever it does this, the CS:GO process is still running as a backround process.
