Think about it..  Have you ever felt like saying something but weren't sure if it would be taken the way you intended it?  The only way it can be not taken how you intended it is if you concede that it wasn't how you intended it.

So that is to say, if you just deny that you meant it any other way, you can always say exactly what you want exactly as you mean it.  

The trick to this is to firm the intention before you even say it, because if there's uncertainty in your voice as you say it, it will cast doubt on how you meant it.  This a strange phenomenon I notice in social interaction.  It's the "confidence effect," and it's quite simple.  The more confident you are in saying something, the less likely people are to challenge the nature of it.

I think this basic point can be applied to anything.  Hesitation is pointless, and maladaptive.  It literally screws things up, messing with our rhythm and flow.  My old baseball coach used to say, "if you're going to throw the ball away, throw it all the way away."  The lesson there was, if you're going to fail, fail!  Hesitation just screws things up.

From a pitcher's standpoint, this is why when guys get the yips, or a "disease" where they can't throw the ball anywhere near the target, the cause of it is overthinking and a complete lack of confidence.  The treatment is always psychological.  Well, sometimes the psychological effects cause physical mechanics to change, but that's besides the point.

Hesitation is the anticipation of failure.  Trust that you can do whatever you're trying to do.  If you fail, be surprised and learn from it, but don't let it discourage you or cause you hesitation on your next attempt.  Have confidence that this attempt will go well, so don't hesitate mid-attempt.   That is certain to only wreak havoc on the attempt.  Go all-in.

Honestly am I making any sense.
