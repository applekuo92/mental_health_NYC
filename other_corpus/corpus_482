Good afternoon, I'm D.S. Ryelle, author of *Barefoot on the Couch*, *Exilium* and several more books. Thursday marks three years since I released my fourth (and possibly most controversial) book *Early One Morning*, a historical drama that was meant to feature a Pagan priestess getting dragged into the trial of Jesus, but ended up being a freewheeling mix of anger, romance and power struggles. *Early One Morning* was followed by the previously mentioned *Exilium*, and will eventually be accompanied by prequel *The Devil's Bride* and a second sequel, *Maggie Have I Known*.

Since the entire seven hour block seemed pretty daunting, I'll just be here from 2-5p Eastern (11a-2p Pacific, 5-8p Brit). In case you don't believe me, ~~here's the proof of my subservience to cats~~ [my humanity] (https://twitter.com/DayaRyelle/status/781564208819298304). I also have a [site](http://dsryelle.wordpress.com), but no dot com, as I've always been a starving ~~artist~~ novelist, and a [GoodReads page](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7359763.Dayanara_Ryelle).


I'll try to keep up with questions and commentary as best I can, so don't worry if I don't get to you right away! (And please feel free to discuss any of my other books, if you've read them.)




**FAQ**

*Do we -have- to talk about "Early One Morning"?*
Not unless you want to.

*What's with all the strikethroughs?*
It's the equivalent of a cheeky aside or whispering under your breath on a game I play. Feel free to use it. ;)


*Why did Jesus/Yeshua tell Julia to call him Josh? Isn't that too modern?*
Not exactly. According to my research, Yeshua is the Aramaic form of the name Joshua; so theoretically, if the apostles spoke modern English, then yes, they might have called him Josh. ~~When they weren't busy calling him "master".~~

For the curious, Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua; while in formal Hebrew, he would have been called Yehoshua.


*What are you working on now?*
A whole lot of nothing! I was working on an adaptation of *A Christmas Carol*, but I must have gotten too proud of myself, because my muses suddenly shut up!
