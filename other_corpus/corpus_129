Aviation communication is heavily reliant on 2-way radio which is entirely unusable when someone is taking up the frequency, and yet I've not heard of this happening as method of sabotage. 

It's not difficult to get a 2-way radio, you need a licence to use it but that's not going to hinder someone with bad intentions and in the civil aviation world it'd be near untraceable.
