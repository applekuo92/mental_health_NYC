BF Bad Company 2 was the first fps I ever played and spent a crazy amount of time playing. I haven't owned a Battlefield since then (due to studying) but I recently bought a playstation 4 and I've been thinking of getting BF1. My question is, is it worth it? How has the Battlefield franchise aged? Like wine or like a sliced avocado stored in the fridge?
