Forgive me, I really am clueless when it comes to investments. I'm trying to learn online but this stuff is confusing as heck. I recently got married and I'm trying to organize our finances and whatnot. We each kept our own checking accounts and moved our savings into a high yield savings account. Things are looking good.
Years ago I worked at a place that had a 401k plan and I got it up to about 10k. Then I moved on and started my career at a place where 401k isn't offered yet. So I asked around and heard that I should take that account and turn it into a rollover IRA account. I still don't understand what it is, but I did it. It's been sitting for a few years without any contributions (I know that's bad, im sorry) and it hasn't moved much. It hovers around 10k and sometimes dips to as low as 8k. So I'm just curious about the advantages of investing in this account versus, say, putting money into our high yield savings account where I'm guaranteed slow but steady growth. Is it mostly tax purposes? Apologies and thanks for any information.
