Hi,

I'm thinking about buying a used keyboard. I don't really play, but I'd like to mess around in my free time, and maybe learn.
I live in an apartment, and don't want it to be loud, do my question is: 

Do keyboards come with a headphone jack, or Bluetooth capability so that only I can hear myself? If so, is it pretty standard, or is that something on more expensive keyboard?
