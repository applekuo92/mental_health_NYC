Hi guys I just saw the witcher 3 sale on steam and after watching some videos it looks definitely cool enough to be bought.

However what really got me is the dialogs and the story, the gameplay looks meh to me.

So should I buy the base game, or the DLC are packed with story too ?

Or should I buy only of the 2 DLCs ?
