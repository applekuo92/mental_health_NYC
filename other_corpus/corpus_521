Hi /r/gaming - long time lurker, first time poster.
I'm nearing the end of a lengthy postgraduate university course, having gone a number of years telling myself not to upgrade from the humble playstation 3 (mostly due to fear of losing all academic productivity).

The joyous moment of regaining some guilt-free gaming time has arrived, and I'm rather tempted to rush out and remind myself of how rubbish I happen to be at first person shooters. 

However I'm equally horrified by purchasing a PS4 now, only to have the newest iteration announced/released inside the next 6-12 months.

Could someone of with a more detailed understanding of the current market please help out an individual who's in "the night before christmas" mode over here.
