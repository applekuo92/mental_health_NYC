Think about it like Fallout Vegas but with millions of zombies wandering.  Think about Z Nation with the giant waves of zombies that come through.   Trying to keep settlements and towns stocked, provisioned, and well defended.  Trying to get gas means protecting the pumping stations and wells all over.  Rival factions etc. 

It could be the most epic game of all time.
