I've been working for a small company (less than 30 employees) for two years. I'm getting a promotion and going from hourly to salary. I am vaguely aware of the new overtime law and how it will apply to me at 40k/yr. My boss is a huge cheapskate in all aspects of his business, especially when it comes to labor and the treatment of his employees. He keeps stressing how when I move to salary I'm going to have to work 50+ hour weeks. However, I know that he doesn't track the hours of salary employees (I'll be 1 of the 2 people currently on salary).How do I go about ensuring I'm getting paid correctly when it comes to overtime? I have yet to mention this to him because he is VERY intimidating and a huge asshole. It feels like he is expecting me to just not report the overtime I work. I have a feeling that if I did say something about it, he would revoke the offer or try to schmooze me into ignoring it. Not sure how to approach this situation. 

P.S. I only was originally offered 35k and thanks to you guys I had the confidence to counter at 40 and he accepted!
