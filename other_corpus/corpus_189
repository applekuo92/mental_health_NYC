I keep having issues with paying my student loans through Nelnet. This is the 4th time I have paid my monthly bill only to have my payments not be allocated properly. For some reason they keep taking both payments for to different loans and putting them both on the U.S. department of education loan. That means they cannot refund to wrong payment to put towards the correct account because they do not have access to us department of education. I am starting to get very frustrated and am getting no help from Nelnet. I cannot be the only person this is happening to.
