My military career is coming to an end next year after my enlistment ends. I have over $25,000 in my savings and zero debt. No car payments, college loans, nothing. The only two bills I have are internet and cellphone. I'm happily married, and me and my wife are looking to move back home to Hawaii after all is done. I don't have a job lined up yet but various family and friends have offered. I'm unsure about whether I'd like to go to college or enter the work force. Also, having been overseas for over half my career, my credit is likely non-existent (I think). I'm looking into opening a checking account with USAA here shortly. Where can I go from here, /r/personalfinance?

Edit: Forgot to add, I use Mint on my phone to track my finances religiously.
