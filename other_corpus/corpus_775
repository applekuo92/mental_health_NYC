There's been a lot of talk and speculation of how Nintendo will go about porting games for the Switch.  Storage and cost are usually the largest issues people bring up.

I feel like I know exactly what Nintendo has up their sleeves.  

Nintendo has been working very closely with Nvidia on this system, and has borrowed quite a bit from what Nvidia has been doing with their Shield line of gaming consoles.  One of the killer-app features of the Shield is Nvidia GeForce Now.  It's a game-streaming service where the actual game is hosted on Nvidia's servers, and streamed to the player's game console.  A monthly subscription fee gets you a library of games to play whenever you want, and there are premium games that you can license on top of that.  They've had some large 3rd party developers, such as Square Enix license games for the service.  I just finished playing through Tomb Raider (2013), and even on my meager 25mb Comcast connection, it had very few hiccups.  The subscription model works great for me because I don't have time to play video games as much as I used to and I can play a variety of games without having to risk the cost of a full game each time.  

My prediction is that we will see a similar service announced by Nintendo just prior to the launch of the Switch where we will have a constantly-growing library of first-party Nintendo games as well as tons of 3rd-party games (likely something from everyone on that list of developers they announced with the trailer).  THIS is how we will get Skyrim.  THIS is how we will get around any storage issues with ports.  This is what Nintendo has up their sleeves for the Switch.
