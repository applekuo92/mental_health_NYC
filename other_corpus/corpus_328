I wonder if  hundreds of years from now people would celebrate Kal-El day and children would hear stories about how Superman saved the planet from countless threats like Doomsday and Darkseid, or how the Guardians created the Green Lantern Corps to fight evil throughout the galaxy just the way we hear stories of how Durga defeated the evil Maisasur or how Moses split the Red Sea in half to make a passage for his people or how an omnipotent, onmniscient,  omnipresent entity called god created the universe in 7 days. Wouldn't it be cool if the new gods replaced the present god/s?
