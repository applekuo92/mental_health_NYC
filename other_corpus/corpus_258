I am a junior in high school. Up until now, all of my classes had been extremely easy for me, even the AP Chem class I took as a sophmore. However, my grades have started to slip because my classes are getting difficult. I've never had to study before, but I'm really worried because my grades are slipping and I don't have any good study habits. Do you guys have any really good tips on how to study?
