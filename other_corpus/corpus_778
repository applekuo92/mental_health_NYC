Hi guys. Live concert streams are getting more and more popular. Like yesterday I was just browsing YouTube and found that Martin Garrix was streaming his concert in Amsterdam live. Was glad to find that stream,  cus the video was quickly removed after the live concert. 

I have also watched streams of live concerts like Red hot chili peppers, Rihanna, Chance the rapper, Alicia Keys +++ the last 6 months on Apple music, Tidal,  Red Bull app and YouTube. 

But it's kinda hard to keep up with which artists who are streaming live and on which platform. 

Have searched for any subreddit or thread where people can post live streams they find but can't find any. 

Let me know if u have a site where I can find it or if you want to be a part of a sub where we post links when we find them :)
