Hi guys,

Sorry if this isn't the right place, I'm really just crowdsourcing advice.

I've lived in the UK for three years and worked for two, though I am actually from the US and will be moving back there next year. For the past year (since I've known I would be moving back), I've sent my savings home every month, but I have a portfolio here (including investments, pension, emergency and some regular savings) of around £12k. 

As I watch the ££ plummet in value compared to the dollar, it doesn't seem to make sense for me to keep sending home money every month (sending home £400 before Brexit got me $580, now it's down to $480). If this were normal currency fluctuations, I wouldn't mind just holding out for a year or two before transferring any money overseas (I have a solid portfolio at home, and won't *need* any of this next year specifically), but I get the impression that this could be a multi-decade issue.

Basically, my question is: continue transferring home monthly savings, and then do a lump sum when the exchange rate looks best? Or hold out until the GBP recovers, whenever that may be? Having just done the math, I stand to lose about 20% of my money here if I transfer it home now (compared to if I had done so in May or June).

Thanks in advance for any of your thoughts!
