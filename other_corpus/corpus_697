My wife and I are looking to buy our first house in the next 6-8 months. We've done some classes and I'm doing a lot of research on my own. My situation is as follows. 

Right now, we don't have kids. We are looking for a place that will comfortably accommodate us for the next 5-8 years or so. Kids are a possibility but not certain, and we don't want to buy a place that's too big and overpriced in the event we don't have them at all. My thought is that, likely, we'll be selling this house within 10yrs. 

On the savings plan we are on right now, we anticipate having about 10â„… of the total home price down in cash. I understand that bigger down payment leads to lower interest rate. However, how big of a deal is that difference (say, putting 20k down instead of 30k on a 300k house) if I don't intend to pay the entire term of the mortgage? 

That is, if we sink that cash in as a down payment, is the mortgage interest savings over the 5-10yrs we actually pay on the mortgage worth the extra cash up front? Or are we as well or better off making a more modest down payment and keeping some extra cash on hand if we just plan to move on in the reasonably short term?

Hopefully that makes sense. Thanks in advance.
