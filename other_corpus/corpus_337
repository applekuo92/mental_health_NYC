"I was just a total bitch to some bro at the gas station. He deserved it though. He asked me what time the game started and I asked him which game? '...uh. The Huskies, sweetie. Hahahahaha! Which game... that's cute that you don't know.' Then he turns to cashier and says 'women huh?'"

"What'd you say?!"

AwesomeBitchGF  
"'Well, sir. There happens to be multiple football games on today. I'm not a mind reader. And if I was, I'm sure I would find a blank slate up there. Fuck off, thank you very much.'"

"The cashier was dying."

I couldn't be more proud!!
