The heat is on in more ways than one, and Natasha can tell that Sergey is getting close. She tries to stop him and ask, "Do you have protection?", but it's too late.

Two months later, Natasha is late, so she takes a pregnancy test. Sure enough, she's pregnant. In tears, she tells her parents. They ask how it's possible. "It's an accident!" she swears.

Her father goes and finds Sergey and demands he handle arranging the abortion. The communist government had heavily restricted abortion, however, and so Sergey had to bribe doctors to try to perform the procedures. He tried and tried, and several doctors were willing, but yet the procedure was never successful. No matter what the doctors did to try to terminate the pregnancy, the child lived on.

Finally, in desperation and losing faith in the Russian healthcare system, Sergey took out a loan and flew himself and Natasha to Paris to try one more procedure. Finally, this one was successful.

After the procedure, Sergey asked the doctor, "Why were all the efforts in Russia unsuccessful, but yours wasn't?"

The doctor replied, "You see, in Soviet Russia, accident survives you."
