So I got into a conversation about how reality show winner rarely make it big in the industry even though they won. I brought up the point that winners rarely last longer than most one in wonders in general. So I got to wondering "what percentage of artists only chart once?"

I think to be fair, the percentage I'm looking for doesn't necessarily mean they hit the top 40 only once, but they came and went relatively fast. So an artist can have 2-3 songs on the chart at once, but then is never heard from again. 

What do you guys think? What would you say is the odds of a reality show winner staying relevant compared to a typical artist who rose naturally? Anyone read any solid study on how fast that revolving door of talent is?
