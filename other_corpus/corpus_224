I'm currently in university and thinking about some topics I can do research about. I've been enamored by the use of statistics in baseball. I was thinking of trying to incorporate MLB statistics in a possible study in the future.

What are stats do you think is indicative of a player's skills (WAR, etc)? What stats could I check into for a possible injury (i.e. lower avg fastball) and what stats should I be wary of when comparing players?

If this infringes on the community rules, I apologize.
