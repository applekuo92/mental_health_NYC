My wife and I are currently renting [**$1,260 a month - heat & hot water included**] and we're at that stage in life that we want to start looking at houses.  We make pretty good money, and both work for the state.  2015, I brought home a Gross Income of **$67,825** and she took home **$54,323**.  Resulting in our total to **$122,148**.  We recently got pre-approved for **$400K loan**.  Obviously we're looking between the **$200-$350 range**.  We  currently have **$7,000 saved up [$1,000 a month into saving]** and looking to have about **$10,000 to put down.**

Loan Officer, a guy through work, said we should aim for 5%, but 3.5% is where you'll probably end up.  He also suggested going into our 401K if we want to look into that route.  What are the pro's and con's for that?  We don't really even have much to begin with, but I figured if we only take out between 2-4 grand, would that even be an issue? There's usually a 10% fee or something?  We don't plan on having children, these are our careers;job wise, and our goal in life is to have a nice home finally.

More back story:  Been married to my wife 2 years and together for 8.  We both started off with bad credit and shit jobs.  She didn't know how it worked, and I sort of did.  I kept putting off school loans, which at the time didn't think was a big deal, but I'm now paying those off on time, and more than minimum.  That's pretty much the only debt we really have. I think I owe a total of **$17K** on one and **$5K** on the other.  We make an automatic payment of $125 and $52 respectively on each one.  I don't really care if we got to pay that off until I'm dead in the ground.  I fucked up, and it is what it is.  Fast forward to present day, both of our credit is really good.  Especially hers, she never went to college [smart girl], and now understands how credit works.  We pay off the full balance owed on all credit cards, before the due date and we've never been late on payments. This includes car payments as well [$300/$245]

Another thing I might add, which may be weird, is we put all of our bills on a joint account credit card.  It helps me keep track of them all in one place, we get cash back on purchases, and we split the payment [which is normally around $1,000-$1,500] to twice a month before the due date.   I'm the leader on our fiances, which I've pretty much learned on myself by either learning from my mistakes, Google, or friends.

I apologize in advance if these questions have been asked/answered before.  I'm BRAND NEW to the fiance game, and home buying game.  I'll answer any question as best as I can.
