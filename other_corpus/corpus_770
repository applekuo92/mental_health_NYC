Lately when I look at the night sky I see a lot of moving stars, or at least appear to be stars. Now satellites would be first guess, but on occasion I have seen some clustered together. I wanted to know if any astronomers had any explanations as this phenomenon seems to be a global one, after doing a quick YouTube search. Thanks.
