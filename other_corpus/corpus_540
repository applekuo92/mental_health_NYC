I'm standing there in the game panicking and it's only a video game. And they did this stuff for real? Balls of steel doesn't even do the soldiers justice.

It was hell on earth and they were right in the middle of it. You see your friends die right in front of you and just sort of have to get on with it. You're constantly one bullet or explosion away from death. It's chaos. You've got bullets flying in all directions, screaming from those dying or those giving orders or both and you're expected to shoot the enemy? You just sort of shoot in the direction you reckon the enemy's bullets are coming from and hope. And this was the early 20th Century, before all the technology the current soldiers have (whom I also respect).

To all those that fought in World War 1, I tip my cap to you and may you rest in peace.
