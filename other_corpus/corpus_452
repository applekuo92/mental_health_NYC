A husband and wife were having dinner at a very
fine restaurant when an absolutely stunning
young woman comes over to their table, gives the
husband a big open-mouthed kiss, then says
she'll see him later and walks away.

The wife glares at her husband and says, "Who in the hell was that?"

"Oh," replies the husband, "She's my mistress."

"Well, that's the last straw," says the wife. "I've had enough. I want a divorce!"

"I can understand that," replies her husband, "But remember, if we get a divorce it will mean no more
shopping trips to Paris, no more wintering in Barbados,  no more summers in Tuscany, no more Jaguar in the garage, and no more 
yacht club. Not only that,  but no more diamonds, no more credit card, and large bank account. But the decision is all yours."

Just then, a mutual friend of
theirs enters the restaurant with a gorgeous babe on his arm.

"Who's that woman with Bobby?" asks the wife. "That's his mistress," says the husband 
                                                                  The wife looks at him for a second and then says,

"Ours is prettier!"
