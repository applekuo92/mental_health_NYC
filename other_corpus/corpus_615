Like a lot of Prime members, I preordered Battlefield 1 in plenty of time with the understanding that it would arrive on release date. It didn't, and won't for a little while longer. I did a little research, and discovered that I'm one person among many having the same problem.

Two Chat conversations and a phone call to customer service failed to provide me with an answer as to what's going on. As a matter of fact, none of the CSRs seemed to understand (or at least acknowledge) the crux of the issue: i.e. the discrepancy between the product's expected delivery date and when it would actually arrive. They just kept thanking me for my order and repeating the delivery date.

I didn't want anything more than an acknowledgment and explanation. I'm not out on the hunt for refunds, credit, or anything else. Shit happens, you know? Anyway, I'm just posting this to let anyone else in the same situation know that you're not the only one having the issue and that interacting with customer service will provide neither an explanation nor resolution. Not a complaint: just a fact. 

See you on the Battlefield. Soonish.
