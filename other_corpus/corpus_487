Hi everyone,

I'm a full-time employee with an older Infiniti that runs well but has had some issues, and I am looking into a good deal on a used Honda Accord. The only problem is that I've only got $2-3k of the $8k the seller is asking for. I generally have $800-1,000 left over every month, which I was putting toward my student loans before. I have a $5.5k emergency fund, so for this I'd be taking a chunk out of my emergency fund and then leaving a bit in it just to have a safe amount to fall back on.

Would getting a used auto loan be advisable in a situation like this? I have a pretty good credit score and history. I'd be able to pay off the loan in a few months (five to six months), but I'm not sure if the interest charged each month would even make it worth it.

Thoughts?
