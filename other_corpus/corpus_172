Reflected light...

The moon, street lamps, dock lights, fone lights...

Why do I see a single and distinct reflection of the moon on the water...rather than a dispersed reflection of the moon or multiple reflections of the moon.

Reflected light is always pointing towards me with its greatest intensity. 
 
Why? How?
