I say this because I just watched "nosedive" the season 3 premier of Black Mirror and thought it was a wonderfully uplifting ending (in its own weird way). I'd also put six feet under's s2 premier episodes ending up there as well with Nate sitting on the beach with his father, realizing the beauty of life in his own realization of his mortality.
