While reading about the recent DDoS news, I followed a rabbit hole which discussed a bunch of different shady companies, and related people, who were using supposedly hijacked IP ranges. One of these ranges was 1.3.3.0/24 so that the hijacker can throw up a "greets" page on 1.3.3.7 (get it?) I'm just wondering if ARIN, APNIC, RIPE, etc actually allocate the ranges, how can someone just hijack and keep them?
