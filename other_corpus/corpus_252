Hello Gaming, 

I have a lot of friends and family in my life that I believe would love today's consoles but just cannot get used to modern control functions. 

An example: My dad and my fiance both love grand theft auto, rocket league, etc. and after watching me play it for a few minutes, they would like to try. They can move around and look around, but just not at the same time. Add any other button combinations to basic maneuvering and they put the controller down and walk away. 

I'm looking for a simple game, or a very detailed tutorial that works on these tasks specifically.  Or if you have any other advice on overcoming these obstacles, please help where you can, thanks!
