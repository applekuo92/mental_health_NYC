I know that David Bowie's been exhausted on this thread, but can we just talk about one of his underrated albums? Like, severely underrated?

Outside follows a concept:

**MURDER IN ART**

It stars many different characters, such as:

Nathan Adler, Algeria Touchshriek, Leon Blank, Ramona. A Stone and many more.

It tells an intricate story of Nathan Adler, a professional detective, trying to figure out as to what the hell went wrong with the world and as to why this new **ART CRIME** has sweeped across the nation and if he could put a stop to it.

Sadly, the story was never finished due to David Bowie's untimely demise in 2016. May he rest in peace.

It propelled Bowie back into the spotlight, but it's not talked about much in the fandom.

Well, what do you people think about it?
