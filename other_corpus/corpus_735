I just wanna start by saying that the budgeting info here has helped me so much recently with my savings goal. 

Another goal is to up my 668 credit score, and I just got a credit card but am very nervous about using it. Does setting up automatic payments affect me negatively in any way? Any other tips or first time credit card stories people wanna share?
