Very Very good film. 
If you can handle it i Recommend you to see it in 3D or even IMAX 3d if you can.
The magic scenes  are very well done and make the screen come alive.
The  crazy mind bender scenes are made for 3d.
However  if the cost for 3d is way more probably skip it  as there maybe is a total of 12 minutes of scenes worth it the rest can be done in normal mode 

Bendict still comes off as a little broody,and a few scenes it seems like he just phoned in his performance.

MadSMikelson or whatever his name is one of the better bad guy's


Now to look forward to a SHIELD  tie in with the TV show as it's clearly heading there.

All in all it's not perfect. the pacing is way off.
It doesn't flesh out "magic" enough, it's pretty much like Oh yeah this thing exists  cool  now move on. and it could be a bit longer.

8.1/10
