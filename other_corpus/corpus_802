Hi all, im 27yo, I make good money at my job but my employer is slowly starting to shift away its pension for its retirees and I fear that soon it will be cut entirely in favor of an extra 401k match instead.

I fully fund my Roth IRA every year, I put in 5% to my 401k and they match up to 3%, but if in the unforeseen future should they lump sum out my pension or cut it before my 5 years vestment at this employer, should I be bumping my 401k contribution up to compensate for that possibility? I've read that most advisors consider the pension a bonus but at the rate it would pay out if my employer decides to keep it, it would be a healthy payout on a monthly basis.

Thanks
