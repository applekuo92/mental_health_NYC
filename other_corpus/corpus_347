Up to to now my parents have been doing my taxes for me, So this would be the first time doing it alone. Also this year I started working freelance gigs and started bringing in an income of roughly 84k a year. 

What would be the most affordable way to pay taxes? Should I get a business license and do taxes through the business, make myself an employee and then file taxes on myself separately? Or should I just file all the cash and checks in my name?

I have no idea how taxes work and kinda scared now that I have to file alone, I feel like if I forget to file a 1 check I'm gonna get thrown in jail for tax evasion or something.
