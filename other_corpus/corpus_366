Hi /r/personalfinance!

I'm just about about to start a business with 4 other co-owners, splitting ownership evenly at 20% each. From my share I expect to take home close to $20-40K from the business in 2017 before taxes. I also have a full time job where I make $50K with benefits.

Are there any good books or other resources to help structure business taxes, business expenses, right offs, etc., and how all that intersects with my personal taxes? 

Also, I am fairly sure I should seek counsel from an accountant, but I don't really know where to start! I'm 24 and need help! Thanks :)
