Looking to open a high interest savings account.


Emergency savings would be around $15k.
House down payment would be around $50k.


I won't be making future deposits to these accounts- so accounts that stipulate you must add additional funds every month won't work for me.


What do you all use and what would you recommend?


Also, is there any risk to these High Interest Accounts? I can't wrap my head around how they can offer up-to 10x the interest rate of other banks. Any info is appreciated.


Thank you.
