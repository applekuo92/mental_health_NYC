One of the primitive reflexes of a baby is to simply imitate what they see others doing , which is how they learn to control their own body (using the person in front of them as a "mirror").
But how does it work in the baby's brain? How can he imitate things by using connections in his brain that he never used before , and how does he even know where they are?
