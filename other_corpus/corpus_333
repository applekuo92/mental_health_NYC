Hello PF!

I read the rules and FAQ (sorry if I missed anything), and made a throwaway since some people know me.

Last year I made $55,000 and saved $11,000 in my 401k and $5,500 in my Roth IRA.

I recently got a new job with a small company and now make $72,000. I want to max out my 401k and Roth IRA in 2017.

Now I've heard that my company limits our contributions to 15% of our salary, which means I can only contribute $10,800. I hate the idea that I got a 30% salary increase but can now invest LESS than before. (If you're thinking I should have found this out sooner: this is the first year the company offers a 401k).

I read about "highly compensated employees" and 401k limits, but I don't get it. Why would my employer limit me, a non-HCE, to invest less than the IRS limit? HCE's will still max out their 401ks by investing 15%, so those of us making <$120,000 are the ones who are effected!

What should I do? Get a second job, change jobs, open a brokerage account? I hate the feeling of missing opportunity for compounding while I'm under 30, but this is my dream job. Has anyone been in this position?
