I am the only women in senior management in a startup tech company.

I have always loved to cook and bake, and have never really had much of a sweet tooth myself.  As such, I've been bringing food, generally baked things, to my jobs for the better part of 15 years.  Even when I worked in restaurants, I would bring in stuff I made- I lived alone and could never finish it all.

My husband brought up last night that I may consider stopping this behavior at my current company given my recent promotion.  He pointed out that there have been many articles written that show that coworkers may perceive women who bring food to share as being more matronly and nurturing, both of which (apparently?) negatively impact the perception of someone's authority in leadership.  

This honestly never occurred to me.  It breaks my heart to think that I should stop a behavior that I enjoy immensely and that I believe my colleagues also enjoy because of some backwards, old-school idea of a "woman's work", but I am also struggling to get my "place at the table" in our management structure in this specific company.

What are your thoughts, twox?  Is this one of those situations where we say "fuck the patriarchy" in the same way that I wouldn't cut my hair short to be perceived as more traditionally masculine, or is this a more nuanced thing that I should be sensitive to given the fact that I am already under the microscope in this position (I am not only the only woman in senior management in a tech role, but I am the only woman in management at ALL at this 70+ person company.)

(as an aside- my husband is NOT stating that he thinks I should stop bringing in the snacks.  I don't want twoX to jump all over him for planting these ideas in my head- he has been my biggest champion in fighting for my "right to parity" within an industry and company which are not friendly to women.  I think he was honestly surprised that I had not considered this previously.)
