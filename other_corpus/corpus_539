This fucked up was happened last month, but it is a lesson for any of you who also uses Uber.

Last month, Uber had a promotion which gives you 30 free trips which worth RM5 each. (Yeah, I'm a Malaysian) I entered the promo code and decided to spend them to a supermarket located about 20 km away from home.

With 30 free trips like this, I think of a smart way to save some money:

> Assume travelling for 5 km costs RM 10, I can let the driver to drop me at somewhere near 2.5 km then didn't pay anything, since 2.5 km trip costs only RM 5 and the RM 5 Promo can cover me up. Next, I can have another driver to drive me to the 10 km destination and still didn't pay a cent.

With this method, in theory, I can go to that 20 km place by spending all my promo codes without paying anything. It works out perfectly, for the 40 km round trip, I only spent around RM 4. (One driver drove me to somewhere else...)

Only if I wasn't that **lazy**.

On the way back, I told a driver about my plan. He agreed, that he will accept all my forthcoming trips all the way back to my house. I told him to stop me before the RM 5 fare mark, plan my next under RM 5 trip, have him to select me as passenger, repeat the process until I get home.

After a week, my Uber app logged me out. I tried to log in again and it say that my account is disabled. I e-mailed Uber support and they say their system detected that I am riding with same driver multiple times and banned my account.

Sorry for my bad grammar.

**TL;DR** I tried to be smart on using promo code by splitting trips into multiple smaller ones, had same driver to fetch me home because too lazy to wait for next driver, and got the account banned.
