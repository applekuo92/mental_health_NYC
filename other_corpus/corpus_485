Pretty basic question but this sub seemed the most fitting!  I routinely use all 3 types, I use borax with my laundry and boric&orthoboric for ant&bug baits and dusting,  but am wondering what differences, if any, there are amongst these 3 forms (if they are in fact different forms!)

My curiosity was piqued when reading a product label, an ant bait product, and it said *"sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Borax)"*, when other products on the shelf next to it were saying 'orthoboric acid' - is this stuff the same or are these different?  It's disconcerting to think an insecticide is a laundry additive as well!

Any help in understanding/differentiating these is appreciated, thanks guys!!
