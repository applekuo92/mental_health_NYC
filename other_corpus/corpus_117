My understanding is that NAFTA is a free trade union that eliminates most tariffs. My understanding is also that the TPP would do the same.

How do American tariffs work ? How high are they? My understanding is that states that have 'most favored trade status' have lower tariffs than those that dont. 

When people try to sell the TPP they state that tariffs are so low already signing this agreement will not have any negatives on us. We are gaining access to markets. If that was the case I do not see why other states would lower their tariffs on our goods in a free trade union. What do they get out if it? If out tariffs are already so low that it does not impact trade than there is nothing in it for them.  

What other trade restrictions other than tariffs would the TPP changed? 

This question is about more than the TPP. Its about how American tariffs work and hiw much they would be reduced with the TPP.
