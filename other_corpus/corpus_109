If you're a teacher and you have a 403(b), or you're thinking about starting one, this is a must-read.

It's about how 403(b)s aren't regulated as strictly as 401s are, and as a result, the fees are much higher than they ought to be. In the end, it can be a difference of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Please help me get the word out.
