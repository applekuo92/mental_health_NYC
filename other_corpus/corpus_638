The report screen doesn't do enough to explain what happens most the time. And it's frustrating seeing habitual trollers and AFKers days in a row be unpunished for their offenses. I've resorted to using report bug for the exreme ones (2 players jumping up and down top of midlane, refusing to surrender while trolling). This shits absurd and it's the same player 3 days in a row now. There's no option for that beyond "intentionally sabotaged" which hardly comes close when it includes that, refusing to play, feeding enemy, and abusive chat.

I get its more work. Maybe on the report player for bad reasons allow us 100-150 characters to explain?
