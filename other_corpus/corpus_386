The internet company I work for granted me 1000 stock options last year.  These vest after 100% 4 years (25 each)  or if the company goes public.  This year they are in talks to convince everyone to convert their options to phantom shares. I am being told that this is for my benefit because payout will be guaranteed on a schedule, whether or not there is an IPO.

Am I being misled?
