I worked for 18 months in the UK and saved roughly 16000GBP. I transferred around 3k when I moved back to the US, but left 13000 in a UK bank account. I was stupid enough to follow the markets and believed the uptick in the exchange rate was a sign that Brexit would be a no. I'm now stuck with either transferring the money now and taking a rather large hit from the amount I was expecting to get or letting it sit a while longer and hope the exchange rate improves.

The money is in an ISA that earns roughly 0.5% interest. If I transferred it here, it would just go right into a non-retirement investment account. I don't foresee needing the money any time soon, so its really just a matter of deciding which makes the most sense. Any suggestions?
