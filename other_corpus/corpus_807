I was driving around my campus, which has many, many stop signs, with crosswalks at each one. Me being a courteous person, I usually allow the people to cross in front of me. I pulled up to one such crosswalk, and I see someone waiting to walk across. We do the quick "You go, no you go" as is custom, before she folds and begins to walk. This is where I fuck it up. I want to make sure that I don't move the car as to not hit her. She's walking pretty close to the car, and it wouldn't be pleasant. However, I go to press down on the brake pedal, my foot slips from the brake to the gas, and I accelerate very rapidly. Thankfully, all I manage to do run over her foot, which she was surprisingly forgiving about, but I shudder to think what would have befallen had I been a second later.
