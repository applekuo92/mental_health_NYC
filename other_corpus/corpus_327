It was yesterday, I'm still recovering.

I work at a coffee bar. Usually I'm there around 7 am, and we get to deal with the crazies real early. Some meth heads, party boys, drunks, homeless, etc. It was a normal day.

Except I was extremely hungover. That one kind where you can barely feel where you head is, let alone talk to people or provide a service.

After 10 mins of barely surviving behind the counter, I asked the other guy working with me to take a break and have a smoke. He's cool with it, like always, and I head out to the back with my cup of coffee.

I sit on the stairs, in the back of the joint. One homeless dude comes by asking for change, and I just keep on puffing my cigarette, kinda looking away. He wanders off in silence..

I turn back to my cup of coffee which this dude obviously swapped. The stink and texture of this liquid shit hitting my lips. I am in shock.

He enjoyed some coffee, I tasted some obvious sort of shit.
