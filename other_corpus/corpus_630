The only game that i have never beaten was a game called Towers: Lord Banif's revenge.  
Ive tried looking up walkthroughs just to know where i went wrong and figure out how the game ends but I've never been able to even find a reference or review of the game.  
Towers was a game boy colour game,  but i recieved it as a loot bag gift whwn i was young from a kid who's father worked in videogame technology.  
Was this a prototype game and unfinished+undistributed? 
Can someone show me how it ends?
