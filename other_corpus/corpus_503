My wife's parents will likely declare bankruptcy soon (in Colorado). Her dad is paid on commission and hasn't made any income in a couple months, while her mom has been out of work. While we haven't cosigned any loans or anything with them, I need some advice on what to do. My wife and I do financially fine for ourselves, but are young (23) and are trying to build savings. 

My wife's car is still in her dad's name, so he has 3 cars in total under his name. I assume he will lose one of them, as I doubt the bankruptcy court let's you keep 3 cars for 2 people (my wife's dad and mom). We are starting the process of transferring the car into my wife's name, but since the transfer is close to filing, will we lose that car? 

What are their housing options? I assume they will likely lose their house. My wife and I live in a one bedroom apartment, but could make it work having them move in if living on the streets is their only other option. 

Since they have no income, my wife and I will likely have to pay for their living expenses for awhile. How do I handle this? While my wife and I have been smart about our budgeting, it's difficult to suddenly have 2 dependants. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.
