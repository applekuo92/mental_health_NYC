Hey! I've been curious about eating a real American Mac n cheese. I found a recipe that tasted soooooo soooooo bad, so I won't be using that ever again. I was supposed to use some mint leaf crap, so I'm pretty sure that isn't a real Mac n cheese recipe.


Now I'm curious about the Mac n cheese the common American eats. How do you make it? What do you eat to the Macs? I fried bacon to mine and it ended up being the only thing I ate from that dish I made.
