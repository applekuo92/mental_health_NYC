An inheritance came that I want to invest what's left after taxes. Paid off all debt, but didn't buy any major 'stuff' (car, house, etc), just want to invest it. Thing is, the outcome of the election has me pretty spooked (how certain outcomes could affect the markets). I already have old investments, and those are not being meddled with much, they've been going a long time and I just sit out the bad and enjoy the good, overall they've done ok and I'm sticking those out come what may.

It freaks me out to have a big liquid savings account just sitting there doing essentially *nothing*, but I am really struggling to focus on investing it lately. Is this a merit-able reason to hold off for a few months, or am I just being paranoid?
