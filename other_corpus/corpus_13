So recently I've found myself in a situation where I can no longer afford to wax my area. I love a smooth area, so I've been plucking it. The only annoying thing is that it seems like every few days more and more hairs are growing back!!! Is there something cyclical about hair removal? What kind of hair removal do you do? I've tried shaving but I hate the dark spots under my skin from the hair there, and I think it's rather itchy. I also don't have much exfoliation materials at home. Is there something I could DIY use, like a sock? (No sugar at home, but I do have salt...would that work?)

I hope it's appropriate to post this here!
