The guy sees this and thinks to himself, "I bet a steak is way cheaper than what I usually buy at this store, I should try that!" So the next day he cooks up a well done steak, takes it to the store, and when the cashier rings him up, puts it on the counter. The cashier looks a bit concerned and says, "Sir, I'm sorry, but we can't accept this as payment." "What do you mean?" says the man. "Just yesterday I saw someone pay with a steak and there was no problem at all!" "Yes sir," the cashier replies, "it's legal tender."
