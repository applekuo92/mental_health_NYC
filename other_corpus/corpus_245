Long story short, I received a mail from ARS collections in the mail. I called them to get an idea as to what this was about. They then respond with, "We're a collections agency, we don't do any reporting to the bureaus."

So few questions:

1. Is it possible to collect debt not on your credit report?
2. If it isn't getting reported, could it one day be reported?
3. Should I repay this any way?
