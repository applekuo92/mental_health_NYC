Hi PF! 
This has been a personal demon for me for the past two or three months. My SO lived and grew up in CT, before his mom moved closer to family. He has always wanted to move back, and I have always wanted to live out of state. This last month I suggested we move there. He would go out first because he has family to stay with. His Dad also has a small side business flipping houses and offered to employee him while out there. 

I would stay in UT while he got settled, made sure the work with his Dad would be stable, ect. Great plan right? The only issue is that this LDR is killing me. I can't take it any more and it has only been two weeks since he left. Long and short of it I planned to move out in December; I want to move out sooner. 

So here is my questions PF I have about $5000~ in savings. I am thinking it would be easier to find a job, apartment, ect. If I am out there but I am scared my savings won't be enough before I find work again. I have look to get another job while in UT but can't seem to get past the location. The other side of it is that my SO's job with his Dad looks like it would be more of a side job where he is paid under the table. It's enough that he should be paying a 1099 (taxform) but he is having issue getting housing because he doesn't have any paysubs or a contact of employment. He's looking for another job now. 

I know the smartest move would be to wait until he has another job or I have an offer from a CT company. However I tend to be a go where the wind takes me kind of person. I just don't want to end up homeless in a city I've never been to. 

TL;DR Would $5000 cover the cost of a move from UT to CT with no job lined up? Only basics being taken via car (clothes, family photos, ect?).
