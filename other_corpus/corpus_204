Do you guys have any ideas for a short film that you were never able to create, or would just flat out love to see be made? Well i'm asking for them! Nothing too crazy (Ex: Justice League vs Avengers, or an Alien Invasion) but something practical. You can go as in-depth as you wish in your idea, or just drop a one sentence idea! Help me out! I'm not asking for your money, or any sort of funding, just your ideas! Comment or PM me!
