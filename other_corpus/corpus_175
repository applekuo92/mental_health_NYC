I (30) recently started a new job at a NFP and was reading this NYT [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news).

Disclaimer: I only have a slight idea of what I'm talking about.

My current investment portfolio is:

- 403(b) through MassMutual 50/50 split between [VSMAX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=vsmax&ei=Rk0LWJmPIoS6mAGFwLWIAg) and [RDHTX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=rdhtx&ei=Mk0LWIHBFMaGmAHpyJrgDQ)

- [VASIX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF%3AVASIX&ei=Fk0LWPH1EoGmmAGr-r_wAQ) which I contribute to personally as my finances allow

- My Roth IRA [VFIFX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF%3AVFIFX&ei=zkwLWNmkBs-ymAG88bu4CA) 

- A small chunk of change in [DSNY](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:DIS) for giggles (Star Wars made me do it)

My question is primarily whether the 0.78% ER on my RDHTX 403(b) needs to be addressed.
Additionally, are there any glaring mistakes in my portfolio?
