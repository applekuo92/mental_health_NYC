I just watched the movie, and despite the critiques I've heard, I went into it mostly blind. I thought it was rather well done. One scene in particular really caught me. Xavier and Magneto are talking at the end, and Magneto asks Xavier if he ever wakes in the middle of the night, worried that "they'll come for you, and your children." Xavier responds that he does, and he feels pity for the people that come looking for him and his students.
I went and looked up "Xavier and Magneto" and the first link was of them playing chess in one of the earlier movies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWDDVuxFboI
Basically a rehash of the exact same dialog, but I thought it was well done. I really enjoyed the relationship portrayed by Stewart and McKellan, and I'm glad the more recent movies are doing a good job of continuing that rivalry and friendship.
Also watching Wolverine go crazy on his escape was just plain fantastic.
I've heard a lot of people saying it didn't live up to the hype, but frankly going into it without a huge build up of 'best move ever' - it was a good sequel despite the Phoenix ex machina at the end.
