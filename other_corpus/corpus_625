So in my signal processing course we are told that an Anti-aliasing filter goes before an ADC. I have a vague idea of what aliasing is. Could someone explain or show what happens with and without this filter before analog to digital conversion? I can't seem to wrap my head around it. I thought preventing aliasing was so that we could get back the original signal, but does an anti-aliasing filter also cause information loss by removing certain frequencies?
