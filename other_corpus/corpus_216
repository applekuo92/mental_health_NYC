I'm 21 years old. And up until 3 days ago I'd never "dealt" with periods.

I was with a friend and we were talking when she started having blood run down her legs. She ran to the bathroom and was really embarrassed. Meanwhile I just sorta stood there holding her handbag.

I had no clue how to react. She was obviously embarrassed. Basically I'm asking for advice as to what the women of twox would like a male friend to do in the case of one of these emergencies in case it ever happens again.

I just want to be supportice and helpful and i have absolutely no clue what I could do in these situations.
