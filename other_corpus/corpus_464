My company announced they are going to freeze my pension contributions as of January 2019.  I will be 53 at that time.  The company will offer a lump sum at that time.  I donâ€™t know an exact amount yet but my best guess is that it will be around $750,000 at that time (Jan 2019).  401k Contributions currently 7% + 6% company matching.  In January 2019 they will contribute an additional 4% to 401k  in lieu of the pension plan that is freezing.
I plan to work till 62. (12 years) and spouse till 54  ( 6years)
I need to determine where to roll that lump sum pension money to.  We have next to no ROTH set up but our combined income is around $150,000 so we currently need the tax deferred contributions of the traditional 401K and would prefer to avoid the tax hit we would take rolling anything into ROTH now.


My Age 50, Spouse 48
Mortgage balance 185,000 on a $340,000 house
My Employer Sponsored 401K : $213,894
My traditional IRA :  $24,881
Social Security Estimate at age 67 :  $2527

Spouse office just started their 401k plan a couple years ago.  Contributing 3% with 3% matching.  
Spouse 401K :  $10,000 (Est) ROTH
Spouse IRA :  $290,000 
Social Security Estimate at 67 :  $2000
 Estimate Pension Lump sum I need to roll over in January 2018: 750,000

So where should I place the estimated $750,000 pension roll over when it happens in 2019?
