I'm studying french literature and am learning to go more in-depth in the texts than I was previously inclined to do as a reader. I was quite happy of the improvements I recently made, especially regarding poetry. 

But yesterday, a friend I asked for suggestions of short stories in English recommended me to read Nabokov's 'Signs and Symbols'. I was quite unsure what to think about it after reading it, and I went to check that [awesome analysis](https://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/dolinin.htm) on Penn State University website. It struck me that I don't think I would've been able to come to half of these conclusions by myself. Since I didn't like that much the story before reading the analysis, and that after the analysis my opinion changed, it saddened me that I basically didn't like it because I wasn't able to understand it, which seems to me like a problem.

So my question to you would be : do you think such deeper comprehension of text comes with practice? Is this story harder to appreciate than most others? (I doubt it since it's a classic.) Have you experienced something similar at one point?

(Here is [Nabokov's story](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/05/15/symbols-and-signs) if you're interested.)
