Hi all,

We all know about IGN, Kotaku, Polygon and even the smaller bigger sites like VG24/7, Rock Paper Shotgun and Destructiod but I wanted to see if you follow any other smaller websites.

My thoughts are sites like:
*[goodisageek.com](http://goodisageek.com)
*[videogamesuncovered.com](http://videogamesuncovered.com)
*[gamerant.com](http://gamerant.com)
*[nintendoeverything.com](http://nintendoeverything.com)

Would be great to see some more! Also be interested to see why you go to those particular smaller sites you read.
