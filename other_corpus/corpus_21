And frankly, I don't understand why people hate it so much.  It was fun, balanced the large cast well, and felt like a consistent and authentic extenuation of the original.  It was very pulpy and I expected as much, being that I enjoyed the original.  Was it corny?  Not so much as the first, but in spots, yes.  Was the action on par:  Yes.  Was the suspense on the same level?  Yes, but not until the end.  I really enjoyed it and hope they make a third.  What do you think?

Edit: To all that are downvoting:  I took the time to provide my reasons for enjoying the movie, can you do the same for your downvoting?  I'd honestly like to know the reasons why.
