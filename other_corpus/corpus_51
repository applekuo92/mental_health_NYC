Last night I watched Deliverance and Dazed and Confused (odd combo, I know). During the scene in Dazed where O'Bannon is giving licks to Herschfelser, he makes him squeal like a piggy, similar to the assault scene in Deliverance. Dazed is set in 1976, Deliverance came out in 1972, so it's possible the characters would be familiar with it. Anyone else notice this? Thoughts?
