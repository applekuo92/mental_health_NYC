In reviewing my family's documents I remembered that 25 years ago we had an attorney prepare a family trust document. However, none of our assets have ever been transferred into the trust. There is no pour-over will providing that assets will be transferred into the trust upon death. My family owns less than $1 million in assets, I have a spouse and two kids and figure everything will go to my spouse or my kids 50/50, and our family and asset situation is not complicated. 

At this point, should I just leave everything as is and not bother transferring anything into the trust? I understand this means that upon my death the trust will fail and essentially be null and void.
