I would figure a non-EQ'd recording would just sound...live. I just don't understand why we have to cut out frequencies that are naturally contained within an instruments' timbre in order to make it sound right, especially when two acoustic guitars, two singers, and someone on a djembe sounds perfectly mixed when it's happening right in front of you. Are we doing a form of self-mixing in live, acoustic settings? And/or is there something about multi-track recording that adds something that needs to be mixed out?
