In The Truman Show, there is only a single occupant (Truman) who doesn't realize his reality is fake.  Everyone else is an actor. The entertainment comes from Truman's naive behaviour.

In Westworld, 99% of the occupants (droids) don't realize their reality is fake and the 1% (guests) are explorers. The entertainment comes from the guests' conscious behaviour.
