Hi ladies! I figured you'd know the best way to answer my question as I've always been helped by you in the past! 

I recently started sleeping with a guy and lost my virginity to him. He's wonderful and caring and I like him a whole lot! 
My question is though; when he fingers me, it feels like I need to pee after a while. Is that normal? I know I don't actually need to go as I'll try beforehand but will get nothing! I'm terrified of urinating in bed :( 

Any advice or help on what this could be?
