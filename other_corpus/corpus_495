There have been a lot of posts that say

1) that time travel doesn't exist or we would have proof already

2) that it is possible, but people don't travel to our time because it's dangerous or boring

3) that it is possible, but we will never see it because timelines will always split off

4) that it hasn't been discovered yet

but maybe it's just the time cops doing their job... and they've been really good at cleaning up messes... after all, their technology would be far superior to ours.
