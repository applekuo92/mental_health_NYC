Hey guys! I have a relationship issue that I just need some insight because lately I've been going crazy and I know I shouldn't be feeling like this. 

Some background, my boyfriend and i have been dating over a year(7 months of dating but exclusive, and 6 months officially if that matters) and lately i realized that he's been snap chatting a girl quite frequently. I brought it up to him that i saw that he's been snap chatting her and he said that she's just a friend and i told him it made me feel a little insecure because i never heard of her before and we talked it out and assured me it wasn't a big deal because he would never do anything to betray me (side note i asked if he was emotionally invested in her and he said no she is a friend).

So a month goes by and I'm over it, so i thought, but i realized the other day that me and him aren't each others #1 best friends anymore but him and the girl are each others #1 (depicted with a yellow heart) and it makes me feel completely uneasy about the situation. 

So where i need your guys' help, should i bring it up again and how without sounding like I'm crazy, or should i just let it go because i even know its not a big deal because its just social media. 

Side note, my boyfriend has been cheated on in the past and I know he wouldn't cheat because he knows first hand what it feels like, but apart of me feels as if this girl has feelings for him and he's oblivious to it. 

I feel like this is a childish thing to be jealous of, especially for someone in their mid-twenties, but it being my first serious relationship I feel as if i don't know how to act on these feelings.
