My computer of five years has started to show its age with loading times, startup, and what games it can play. I have a 670m GeForce video card, a 2.3 Ghz processor that is not overclockable, and its a Laptop, Specifically the Asus G75VW. I want to get a new computer that will serve me for a long time but I don't have that much money. Is there any good build or laptop that has at least a 970, 2.6 Ghz, less than $900 and if a laptop can be used as a desktop
