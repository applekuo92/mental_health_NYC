I don't mean to put a negative light on anyone - I know that people are homeless for a variety of reasons, addicted to drugs for a variety of reasons and the worth of what you've done with your life is subjective. But I realised today that I can't figure out what direction to take my life in, I'm not one of those people who can just suck it up and choose one and there's a good chance I'll end up going nowhere.
