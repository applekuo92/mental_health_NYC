2 year old Redwood deck, originally finished with Sikkens that lasted 2 winter seasons and now is in bad shape. 

I'm getting ready to refinish again but my Father thinks that it's a waste of time to use Sikkens again, and said I should just oil finish my deck (he says repeated oiling would not require sanding, which Sikkins obviously does).

I really want a beautiful finish that I can retreat yearly without sanding. But I live in Utah where it snows a lot.

What would you suggest? This is my first redwood deck, and it cost me a bunch of money so I don't want to do anything wrong.
