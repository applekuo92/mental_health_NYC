I'm military taking home 48k a year. I'm a new homeowner. Car fully paid off. 5k in savings. Credit card is paid off in full every month. Looking to get 30k for home improvements, the largest of which will be solar panels (won't go through the solar company's lender for unrelated reasons).  Credit score is about 750. My finances are pretty solid, but I just want to know what lenders would be the best options to apply for an unsecured loan without having to drain my credit score by applying a bunch of times. Any advice would be appreciated.
