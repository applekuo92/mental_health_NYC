Although cable networks have usually produced less episodes per season than their broadcast brothers for many years, I think it has really become more prevalent with the rise of streaming services.  So, I was just wondering what everyone thought of it.

For myself, I love the shorter seasons (13 or less episodes).  It allows me to view more series while never getting bored after the 20+ episode.  Thoughts?
