Hi r/diy! I am replacing some coat hooks from a shelf that originally have threads for regular logs (don't know how else to word that). They go into the shelf on one side and is fastened with a back piece on the other side. 

I found almost identical coat hooks but they have wood threads at the end, made to screw directly into the wood.

What I'm wondering is if there are some kind of back pieces or logs for wood threads? If not, how would you guys solve this?

I have tried google, but with no results.

Please excuse me if this is the wrong place for this question, and please point me in the right direction!

*edit: changed coat hangers to coat hooks.
