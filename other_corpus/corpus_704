I want to play Dying Light, but it's so confusing.  There's the base game, the expansion "The Following", "The Folowing enhanced edition", "Dying Light enhanced edition", "Dying Light Season Pass" which may or may not include either the base game or the expansion (and if it doesn't include the expansion, what the hell kind of season pass is it?) and then random other DLC.  But what package do I buy?  Why is it so hard?

Edit:  [Here's a picture of what I mean... you need to buy Dying Light: The Following to buy Dying Light: The Following?](http://i.imgur.com/N4a5sdP.png)

Edit2: And now there's apparently an uncut version... I guess that version has gentile zombies?
