Like most fuck ups on this page, this actually happened about 3 days ago.

 I was sitting in class and listening to the amazing album Toxicity by System of a Down. As I'm listening to the song Toxicity I hear how amazing that song is. I decided I would find the drum sheet music for it so I can go home and learn this song. I then get home and start practicing the song. At first it was really hard for me since it's really fast paced but I quickly caught on to it. A big thing to know about me is that I rage when I play. I throw sticks and kick stuff over,  I'm destructive when I play. As I'm playing along with the song I finally nail the intro but mess up an important fill. This sends me into RAGE! I stand up and hurl a drum stick across the room and start kicking stuff. I heard a big bang and looked up... My drum stick had completely destroyed by big flatscreen tv. My rage quickly turned into regret. I'm now hoping no one in my house goes downstairs and find what I did before I find a way to explain it. 

TL;DR: Wanted to learn a song on drums. Ended up destroying my TV in the process.
