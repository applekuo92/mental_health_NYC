Hi all, 

Every cycle, right after ovulation, I develop extreme anxiety and panic attacks. I get fearful that I am about to have a seizure or stroke, and it's incredibly debilitating. I also have an issue with any sort of coffee consumption. Does this sound familiar? Has anyone had relief with this?
