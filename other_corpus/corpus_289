Who so you think are the real pest? Us or some animals? Ex. Rat so you think if we don't invade most of their natural environment and have their own habitat to live then they won't be bugging us on our life. We humans are the most intelligent species ever evolved on earth so it's up to us if we will preserve our own environment or keep exploiting it until all iur resources runs dry. You won't appreciate the worth of the well until it's dry.
