Hi!  
I am 26 years old Norwegian, and trying to be more financially independent.   
  
  
My situation  
I have a good emergency fund  
I have 36k (USD) in studentloans with a fixed 2.5% interest rate (next 10 years).   
I can easily save 2k (USD) a month, while living fairly comfortable.  
I currently have 12k saved up.   
  
  
Additional information:  
I do not need health insurance, health care is free in Norway  
Unemployment gives me most of my salary for a few years.   
Permanent unemployment due to sickness gives me 66% of my salary permanently  
Retirement at 62-65   
  
  
I am considering renting insted of buying for the next 10-15 years.  
Current housing interest is 2.5-3%,  
Price of renting is 1.5k for a 300k apartment  
Renting makes it easy to scale the housing based on current needs.   
Moving does not incur a loss of about 12k for selling the house, and lots of stress.   
  
  
Question 1:  
- Should I rent and invest or buy?  
- Where should I put my money?  
  
  
Without knowing much about diversification I was thinking of something like this:  
20% - Bonds  
   
  
80% stocks with:   
    20% in my country (OSEBX - Norwegian index)  
    40% S&P 500  
    40% MSCI  
  
  
I hope anyone can help me and give me some good advice!
