So this happened last night. I had just gotten on the train to head to the opposite side of the city. I knew this was going to be a very long train ride, so I brought along my rubiks cube. Over the past couple of years, I have become quite adept at solving these things and it tends to draw attention. Of course this being around 10 o'clock, there were a few drunk people around who were also a part of my audience. One of these people was a man with his wife and children, all of whom were mesmerized by my ability to solve this puzzle.

Here's where the fuck up begins.

After watching me solve the cube many times, the man informs me that it's making him dizzy. I kind of laugh this off thinking that he was just making a sort of off hand comment and I continue to solve it once more. When I showed him the solved cube, the guy looks at me dead in the eyes with the most blank stare. He then proceeds to stumble backwards, nearly falling over, grabbing his child to stabilize himself.

Then it fucking happens. The guy unloads a volley of vomit that would put a fire hose to shame - all over the head of his kid. Everyone around him just kind of stared at him holding his kid like he's a toilet bowl. Meanwhile, his kid just stands there in shock standing stiffer than a statue, no words. He just fucking took it. They got off at the next stop.

Tl;dr
I blew a guys mind with my Rubik's cube, he blew chunks on his kid.
