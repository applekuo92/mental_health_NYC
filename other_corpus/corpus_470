Ok so it's been a while since I read the book, but when I read it I got a sense of ominousness and gloom. The book was even blood-chilling at points (the pictures were very eerie) and reading it at night made it haunting in a way. The trailer, however, seems very colorful and light-hearted, almost magical and majestic. This made me upset because if anything, this book should be turned into an eerie movie. Thoughts?
