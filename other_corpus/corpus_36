I saw Psychonauts in a post and it reminded me of the time I tried and failed to get my boyfriend to play it.  We've been together 10 years and he still won't finish Legend of Dragoon. I used to joke about it being a marriage requirement. 

If you guys had to make completion of certain games a marriage requirement which games would you pick? Or to put it another way, what game do you feel your significant other needs to beat or they  couldn't possibly be right for you?
