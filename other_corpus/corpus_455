My question is, how do we know that the things they're teaching us are indeed true?
We usually refuse to believe mythological stories because they contradict science. Because they're not scientific. But how do we know that the scientific things are actual things and not made up?

I was debating a friend about some topic, and he responded with "Okay. So let's say my beliefs are wrong. How do you know that these scientific things you're saying are true? Why do you believe them when there's no proof you can see that they're true. Scientists say there is proof. But how do you know they're not lying?"

So this pretty much sums up my question.  Why do we believe scientific theories when we, as ordinary people leading a normal life, in many cases cannot see the actual evidence? Why do we take their word for it?
