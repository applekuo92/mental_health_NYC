Both obviously directed by JJ Abrams. Both have the highest box office of their respective franchises. Both have high Rotten Tomato scores. Both have been criticized for ripping off plot elements/scenes of previous installments. It's interesting to note during the press tour for The Force Awakens JJ Abrams noted how he felt he dropped the ball a little with Star Trek into Darkness yet some of the same criticisms have now been applied to The Force Awakens.
