I know this is a question asked often here. But after searching, I couldn't find a solid answer for my specific situation.

I'm 19, taking full time classes and working 30-40 hours a week. My  wife does the same and we both share our truck to get to work, school, ect. We want to sell the truck to buy a car and save money on commuting. We have $5000 in savings (however, we can't go below $3500 without being charged with a bank fee) and plan on getting $8,000 from the truck. I also plan on spending $4000-$6000 on the car.

Our problem is, everyday we need transportation for work and school. So selling the truck and having a week without a vehicle wouldn't work. I can't get a rental since I'm 19, and I really want to sell/buy privately to get a better deal. Is there anyway I can go through this process of selling and buying a car without losing transportation for an unknown period of time? Thanks for the help.
