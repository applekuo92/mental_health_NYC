Hi guys, as the title says really. I'm from the UK and this Christmas I'm treating a family member who has had a terrible year to a holiday to the US for 4 days, although in order to book flights and accommodation now I've come to the conclusion I need to get a credit card to cover the initial costs. 

I have no problems whatsoever in paying back my spend, but I want to find a 0% card which is interest free for an extended period of time. 

Everyone has pointed towards this deal http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/best-0-credit-cards

Spending length: 28 months 0% | Card issuer: Mastercard | Min income: N/A Minimum repayment: Greater of 1% of balance plus interest, 2.25% or Â£5

In layman's terms, is this a good deal?
