I very recently have watched a couple of lectures about how good storytelling can be almost a hack to having great conversations and making a great impression.


I figured I would like to see great examples of really good storytelling(like the dad in Big Fish), and hear your opinions on storytelling in general - the structure, the delivery and so and so.
