I have found that my viewing has become almost exclusively TV shows.

I think there are a number of reasons.

Firstly - personally, a lifestyle change since having a baby: getting to the cinema is logistically so much more complex now that I simply don't do it. This I miss: one of my favourite pastimes used to be going to a cinema with a more eclectic/arthouse mix of movies and just walking in and seeing whatever happened to be showing. No preview, no blurb, no advertising, nothing more than knowing the title printed on the ticket. Seen so many good things that way.

But that doesn't really explain movies: why is it that when I open Netflix or similar, I'm just never drawn to the movies? I am watching concurrently six or seven excellent TV shows that keep me totally gripped, entertained, and with incredible performances by incredible actors.

I'm trying to remember the last movie I saw. It was at a relatives house, and he had some DVDs he'd rented, and recommended that we watch **Money Monster**.  It seemed a good choice - George Clooney, Julia Roberts, directed by Jodie Foster; even a guest appearance by Catriona Balfe, a favourite of mine from **Outlander.** So a good cast, a topical topic, I'd seen a couple of previews a while back and thought it looked interesting enough.

And yet, I found it very shallow and very boring. Now, it's not a great film, I guess. And there are plenty of bad TV shows. But I think it's a film I would've enjoyed more a few years ago. It seemed rushed, there seemed so many opportunities for development that just weren't pursued because it's only 100 minutes long.

I know it's supposed to be the golden age of TV, and... maybe that's true. If that's the best a few major Hollywood stars can come up with, then maybe they're just not trying hard enough? That's not going near all the endlessly awful Transformers-et-al films that dominate the box office.

Or maybe it's just simply that I've accidentally "gamified" my TV viewing: I use an app to keep track of the shows, how many episodes left, broadcast dates etc; this means that there is a sort of slightly obsessive imperative to watch more of each show, and any diversion to some other entertainment is like a wasted opportunity when I could be ticking off another show on the list.

So perhaps it's just me with a mild addiction?
