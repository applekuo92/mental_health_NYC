So, I built a [little end table](https://imgur.com/a/001BW) for myself and hot glued a bunch of caps on top. I want to do a pour-on tabletop, but I am not sure how to approach that with the vinyl magnet in the center. 

(I know, I know, yet another bottle cap table)

Should I glue the magnet down and take my chances with trapping air underneath it? Attempt to fill in the spaces between the caps first? This is my first time doing this, so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great advice. Several people recommended a test run and then a two-layer approach. I'm going to try going with that.
