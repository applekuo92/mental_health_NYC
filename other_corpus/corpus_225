This happened last night, I'm a restless sleeper to begin with but last night I was a holy terror. I fell asleep first and he came to bed after me. Right as he started to fall asleep I punched him in the face while I was still sound asleep to which he responded by yelling "what the fuck" and shoving me. I woke up startled as to why I was being shoved and yelled at.

tl;dr I had a nightmare and punched my fianc√© in the face
