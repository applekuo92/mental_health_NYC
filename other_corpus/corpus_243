Or in family films, when adults fall in love or something there is really obvious mooning, or if they have a plan they spell it out out loud, bad characters are very obviously bad- stuff like this, the adults are incapable of acting subtly like what real life adults do.

How come kids don't know these aren't realistic portrayals of adult behaviour and why is it so heavily obvious? shouldn't kids be able to understand more without being spoon-fed by that age? do kids not appreciate any mystery? 

there are some exceptions, obviously. but examples of what I mean are when two adults in a film will be romantically involved and they talk over each other about how they both love the same thing and/or they stare with a lovestruck look on their face.
