My mum and stepdad are big fans of Strictly Come Dancing and they both work, leaving me in the house on my own. Now they told me to record Strictly; which is fair enough. 

I was recording an episode of NCIS at the time and I forgot that both were recording at the same time so I clicked onto another channel, then a message popped up and I just clicked on the first one I saw, which was Strictly, not really reading the message. So I've only half recorded Strictly and now I'm worried that my stepdad and mum are gonna be fuming. :(
