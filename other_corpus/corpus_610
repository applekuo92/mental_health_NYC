Thrive hosted a Spring '16 freebie promotional. It came with an automatic free trial membership, but I canceled that the same day. 

I get the following email **March 30, 2016**

> Before we cancel your account, we’d like to offer a 6-month membership for $29.95 as an alternative. This shortened membership will allow you the same access to savings without having to commit to the full year’s price. This change is already reflected on your account.
However, if you’d prefer not to take advantage of this offer, please reply to this email.

No charges on my account (USAA) or membership, so it was weird when I got another heads up that my membership was again still active. I canceled it and was sent the following email **May 19, 2016**

>Thank you for trying out Thrive Market. We’re sorry to see you go!
I have canceled your free trial membership and you will not be charged.
If you do decide to shop with us again, please note that the nonrefundable membership fee will be charged the day after you place your order.
In the meantime, please feel free to check our site and follow us on social media for updates. We hope you'll consider joining again in the future!

More confusing than perplexing, but okay. Because of these emails I was under the impression I was no longer associated with this business. It wasn't until I was I was hit with a **$29.95 bill** on my card (**June 7, 2016**) that I checked my 50+ spammy promotional emails from them:

**May 22, 2016**

>We hope you're enjoying your free trial, and we can’t wait to welcome you on as a Thrive Market member! As a member, you’ll get a full year to enjoy the world’s best healthy products always up to 50% off retail prices!
On May 26, 2016, you will be charged $29.95 for your annual membership - Welcome to Thrive Market! If you have questions about your membership, please visit our FAQ.

They actually sent me two emails telling me there was a problem charging me! They must has worked it out because they re-joined me **June 6, 2016**:

>Dear Wendy,
Thank you for becoming a Thrive Market member and helping to make healthy living easy and affordable for everyone!

I canceled; I did the whole thing over again.

Today, **October 22, 2016**, they have emailed me again:

>On October 26, 2016, we will renew your annual membership and charge your card $59.95, so you can continue to shop healthy and save big.

Not only have I canceled my account with them multiple times, but USAA has since sent me a new debit card (the other one simply expired). Thrive can't seem to verify my account and transactions by using my email alone, or date of "purchase," and one of the support staff has asked me for the last four digits of my debit card I used. 

Instead of offering emailed support, they now only offer a phone line. That's fine, but I would like to keep archiving all of these conversations so that I have definite proof of cancelling my account. 

**Before I call Thrive, should I contact USAA about this? How can I get Thrive to stop renewing my account permanently?** 

I'm a grad student right now and $25 is no chump change for me. I've since given up hope to ever getting my $29.95 back from June 7th.

Any help would be very appreciated.
