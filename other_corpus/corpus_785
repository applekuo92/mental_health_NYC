Previously I've not been the best when it comes to credit and my credit score is ruined (my own fault, yes.) but financially I'm a bit better off now, I'm working 50 hours a week etc.. But I still can't get credit (even for a cheap mobile contract). 

My question is how the hell are you supposed to make it better if you've previously abused it? 

I feel I trust myself better now when it comes to money so would like to start building my rating up now for the future, maybe it's too late?
