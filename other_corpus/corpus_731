We keep the house cool because of energy costs and I've been using a giant dog bed as a sofa blanket for years.   I don't own a dog, i just like how insanely warm the thing is as a blanket.


Something like this can be picked up at a lot of different box stores or online for around 30 bucks.   Less then many blankets.
