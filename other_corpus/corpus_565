Hi, I'm a recent listener of Zedd -- I found him through Porter Robinson, he was just recommended out of nowhere. I really enjoyed the album overall, so I looked further into the production of it...I ended up finding an interview where he clarifies that all the songs of True Colors are themed after their own colors. He also stated that you could feel the colors in the song -- which I tried doing below, other than the colors I found from his interviews.

So after some extensive searching online (and some of my own assumptions after listening), I've come to the following conclusions: 

* **Addicted To a Memory:** Purple (stated by Zedd) 
* **I Want You To Know:** Unsure
* **Beautiful Now:** Magenta (assumption)
* **Transmission:** Grey (assumption) 
* **Done With Love:** Teal (stated by Zedd)
* **True Colors:** Red (assumed by the album cover) 
* **Straight Into The Fire:** Orange (assumption based on title...)
* **Papercut:** Black or White (assumption)
* **Bumblebee:** Yellow (assumption based on title)
* **Daisy:** Soft Green (assumption) 
* **Illusion:** Blue (since it's the only color not yet taken?)

Feel free to add anything you think, or official colors you know about!
