I'm starting a high yield savings account with Synchrony bank because there is no minimum deposit to start or upkeep the account and they have 1.05% interest rate. Seems like a no brainer to put about 200 a month or part of my bonuses into that account instead of doing a money market account. If I need to use the money, I can just transfer funds to my bank checking account. So tell me why a money market account would be a better option?  If I transfer money over, will there be a waiting period to use it? They said I can transfer up to $250,000 to my checking to be used. Only thing is I can't just write a check directly from that savings account because the purchase limit on it is $500/day. Any input is appreciated.
