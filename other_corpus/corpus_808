I'm 16 and I just feel like everyone else was raised better than me.  It's like people just have a better control of their emotions and the way they think and have an understanding of how the world works.  I feel really hopeless.  I just dont understand how im supposed to function in this world.  I don't know what I want from life or how to get it.  I'm just really confused.  I dont even really know or understand what hard work is.  What I'm saying makes sense in my head but I'm struggling to type it out here, I can try to explain better if anybody wants lol.

Idk I'm just struggling with life

Edit:  wow lots of comments. I'll respond to some of you when I'm less busy
