I am currently using an app called spending which is working great but it's only on my phone so each time my wife buys something, she either has to give me the receipt or tell me what she bought and how much it cost. There has to be an app out there that my wife and I can both put on our phones that links together so we can each enter expenses in and it updates on both phones. Does that exist? I don't like mint so is there anything else out there?
