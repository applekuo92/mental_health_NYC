The ceiling of my bathroom was full of black dots. I'm pretty sure this was caused by water vapor from the shower and it was worse close to the window, where it is colder and condensation occurs more easily. Next to the light, where it is warmer, there was no mold at all.

I got advice from my neighbors and saw several web pages about it. Spraying bleach won't won't work on porous materias if the mold is deep inside, but in this case everything was on the surface so it was ok. Took all precautions, covered my eyes, mouth and hands, and used a white bathrobe to protect my clothes. Ventilation was good and I didn't spray more than 1m^2 per day to avoid the buildup of toxic gases.

Results are good, my ceiling is whiter than ever, but...

Now water condenses much more easily than before. I let it dry very well for several days using a dehumidifier, but still every time I take a shower it all becomes wet. I can recognize the spraying pattern in the moisture even if it was caused by vapor, which makes me think that spraying it made it prone to condensation. I'm concerned not only that the mold will come back very easily with this extra water, but also that the paint may be ruined.

Not posting pictures because it's not easily visible if not looking at it in person.

I know there will always be *some* condensation with a lot of vapor on a cold surface, but hopefully I can get it closer to the pre-treatment levels? Google only tells me what I already know about bleach (hazardous gases, porous materias, etc).

Is there anything I can do about it?
