My company does not allow opening a retirement account until 2000 hours of service.  I moved my funds from my last companies 401k into a vanguard account. I am currently putting in post tax money but I feel like that is not ideal as I'm not letting it grow as fast.  Any recommendations?  Should I/Can I open up a Roth account?

Thanks!
