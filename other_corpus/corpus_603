My father wants me to buy his house from him. I want it. He wants 130,000 and believes it will appraise for more. I talked with a mortgage company and we are planning to do a gift of equity for down payment. I would like to write the contract for more to finish paying off my student loan debt(-13,000), which would technically be a transfer but the interest is half, and would only add 100 or so to mortgage payment instead of the 500 I'm paying a month on them.  Father is more then willing to help me on this.  We're thinking around 153,000. I've crunched all the budget numbers and going from renting with student loan payments vs. mortgage and no student loans, it's roughly the same when estimating all other monthly bills. Am I missing something?
