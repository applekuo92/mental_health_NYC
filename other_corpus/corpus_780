So like a lot of people, I recently saw the new teaser trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2. It's awesome.

Now usually when a new trailer for a game that I'm interested in or curious about comes out, I'm all over it. I'll watch it a few times from day to day, try to pick out the bits and pieces of interest or just generally psych myself up and get excited. And like a lot of gamers, I'll watch the following trailers that come out all the way up until the release and gradually learn more and more about it: Mass Effect: Andromeda, for example, is something that I'm constantly following.

My question for you guys is how have trailers and - as a result -  learning more about the game's story, characters, setting, etc. affected your experience of video games? Has it been for the better? Or do you prefer to shut out all kinds of marketing so you can discover it for yourself upon release? Because the idea of discovering *everything* yourself when you play the game is something that in retrospect I always experienced as a kid playing video games but haven't had since I discovered the internet.
