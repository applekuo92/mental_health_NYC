First things first, I **love** reading. As a kid I would eat books up constantly. If I had a spare break after doing something I would read a book. If I went to the bathroom, the book went to the bathroom. If I was eating, I was reading. I mean, I guess not constantly; I did other things too, like video games or playing outside, but nothing really hooked me quite like em.

So, the past few years I've been doing jack shit for reading. In fact, I've probably only read one book in this entire span of time (when before I would sometimes read one a day), and that was Less Than Zero, because I could kind of empathize with that feeling of floating through existence. And the way it's written is just perfect for a dead brain. I've just been seemingly incapable of starting a book, because it feels I've been operating at half capacity, and I wouldn't get the full thrill of the ocean with such shite tattered rags for sails.

However...now that I'm starting to feel the call once more, it's finally dawning on me how much fucking time I've wasted doing unbelievably pointless and unfulfilling shit that could've been better spent reading and ffrrrrdfgkln I'm going to be regretting this for the rest of my life, aren't I?
