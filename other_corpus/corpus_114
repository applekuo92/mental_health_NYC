I remember during the 04 ALCS/World Series, I was too young to stay up for the entire games because of school the next morning (I was 9 at the time). I would wake up to a note taped to my door on the results of the game from the night before with stats and highlights of the game from my father. During game seven of the ALCS however I remember staying up for the entire game and then again for game four of the World Series. I still remember the goosebumps I got, That was the first time I realized how much joy a sport could bring someone.
