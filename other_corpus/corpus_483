Should I try to refinance my condo mortgage again to try to lock in a lower rate and reduce monthly payments?  Please have a look at my picture:


Details:    
*Condo: valued ~$425,000 in Bay Area, California    
*Current mortgage: $205,000 @ 4.05% 30yr fixed = monthly payments of $985    
*Refinanced in June 2015, but condo was not owner-occupied (so higher rate), but I now live in it.  This is why I want to refinance with rates still being low.    
*No other debt, pay all credit cards in full, <5% utilization rate    
*Credit score ~750-760    
*$60k in 401k, $11k in rIRA, $5,500 in tIRA, $20k savings    


However:    
*Just changed jobs last month.  Same industry, slightly higher pay, ~$76k gross    
*I churn, so I opened 5 credit cards since refinancing.. 2x in July '15, 1x in April '16, and 2x in July '16.    


So.. will my recent change in jobs and quite a few new lines of credit hurt my chances?  Is it worth it to try to refinance again and take advantage of owner-occupied rates and lock in a lower rate now?
