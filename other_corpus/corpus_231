I was trying to ask google "what is the terminal velocity of an apple" to determine if it would be deadly.  
Then I thought that I can reduce this if I know it's symbol, to something like 'x of an apple'.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity

We see that 'Vt' is terminal velocity. I don't know how to express it properly.

But I don't know what this.. subscript thing is.  
So if we have "four times times four times four times four", we can verbally say, "4 to 4th power",  
and reduce its expression to, "4 ^ 4".  
So if we have 'Vt', our verbal input would be, "V <something> t", and its reduced expression would be, "V <something else> t"  

&nbsp;  
Hope I explained that right.  
What is <something>? What is <something else>? How would I express it verbally?  
And more importantly, what is this subscript thing in math at all?
