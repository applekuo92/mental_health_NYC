I was the first in line and when the light turned green so I went through the light. Suddenly I'm being honked at by everyone and just missed getting t-boned. Still don't know how that truck missed me. But anyways, it was a fucking funeral. 

While paying a little more attention could have saved me a near death experience, I feel like the vehicles weren't marked and there was no police escort so I guess I'll be careful going through green lights from now on.
