I'm a senior in college right now with plans to go to law school. However, I'm starting to think that I want to take a gap year. I've grown up my entire life sheltered and completely supported by my family and I need a change. I love them very much but I feel like I need to do this because I won't ever have the opportunity to do this at any other point in my life. 

I have about $7500 in savings and I wouldn't ask my family for any support financially. I want to do this on my own. I'm currently in the northeast and I'd like to move somewhere relatively far. So far I'm thinking of places like Seattle, New Orleans, Madison, Atlanta, Phoenix but I'm pretty open to other places. 

I was wondering what steps I would need to take to make this work. I would only be living out there for a year so I was wondering if I should seek an actual desk job with a business (I have a degree in mathematics) or something that doesn't require skills like a cashier or store clerk. Would I be able to support myself with that kind of job and 7500 in savings? Could I land a "real" job for a year. I have so many questions and if anyone who has done this could offer some input that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
