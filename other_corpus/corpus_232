Hey guys,
So I'm a Swede who just moved over from the UK to America.
Back in Sweden it's not really a big thing to have a credit card and I never got around to getting one during my years living in London. So bottom line is I don't think I have a credit at all (don't know how this works really, hence the ELI5). 

Here's the question. What should I do to build a good credit (preferably pretty fast) and how do I get into the market? Read somewhere that you need a credit to get a credit card, which is a bit of a catch 22 for me.  

It might be good to know that my wife is American and she has a good credit. We both already work and both have pretty good salaries. It might be some way to piggy back her to get started?

I'm banking with Bank of America but will probably get a credit card from somewhere else with a better cash back or travel deal.

Any help and Do's and Don'ts would be much appreciated.

Huge thanks!
