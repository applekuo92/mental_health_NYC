Just to give you some context, this is my music teacher I'm talking about. He's 55 and married and has two kids, he's also notorious for being a perv. 

So, I'm sitting in class, all the lights are off and the movie Amadeus is playing. I'm bored out of my mind watching this movie and I start to look around his room. I started to look at him just as this girl got up from her seat to hand in a late assignment. She hands it in and as she walks back to her chair, I see him obviously stare at her butt and give some sort of nod of approval. He then immediately see's me staring at him with my mouth opened. He tries to play it off by staring at a window.

  I was taken back. I looked around to see if anyone had witnessed this. I turned to my friend and asked "Holy shit, did you see that?" he replied yes with this face o_o. We started to break into a fit of laughter. He stops the movie and ask's us if we'd like to share what's so funny in an obnoxious way. My friend says "Im laughing cause you just looked at a 13-year-olds butt" Everyone in the room burst into laughter and in a fit of rage he gives everyone 20% off their test grades. Including me.

(FYI this classroom had people of all ages, im 16 but the age range of the class is 12-17)
