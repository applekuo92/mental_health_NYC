I have a job where I am paid a lot of overtime in the spring and my hours are cut considerably in the summer.  My boss suggested that I "bank" the overtime hours from the spring so that I'll still get paid in the summer.  But, he said those banked hours would not be paid at overtime rate.  

From what I understand that is not legal?  I am a non-exempt employee of a private company in a state that does not have its own employment laws, so we fall under the FLSA rules.
