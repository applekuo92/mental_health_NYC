Everyone in our family shares my father's TV provider to catch up any content we miss the other day. One time I was trying to login to it and for some reason, the password didn't work.

So then, I made my father upset.....by changing the password of our TV provider.

Little did I know that the email used for our TV provider is also used for our bank account.

Today, my father found out that "somebody" hacked into his email. He then angrily scolded at me for doing so. I told my father why I changed it. He then told me he changed the password in the first place with one little change to it,l. He didn't explain that to me before I did it.

After scolding at me, he then told me that "everybody in our family fucks up all the time." After resolving with the bank and other services, we went out to lunch together. No harsh punishment here. (Unless I did it again, I'll pledge not to, and I will suffer the consequences)

Lesson learned: Ask before you change. Don't fuck up your family's lives like I just did.
