I have been reading through posts. However, what my husband and I have seems a bit different than the typical "just graduated, making money, have loans", because we moved to a different country.

He had approx 20K in loans, and just put a lump sum of 14K down (we kept 4K for emergencies). His interest rate is 4.5%. He currently has to pay interest on his loans. I have 44K in student loans, but interest doesn't start for me until August 31st, 2017 (since I'm technically still a student), and for the first 6 months after that my interest is reduced to just 2.5%. 


*After taxes, every month I make $2350, and he makes $3350.

*Total income after taxes: $5694

*Monthly non-negotiable expenses:

*Rent: $1119

*Commuter train tickets: $410

*Cell phone: $30

*Groceries: $1000 (we live in a very expensive country now, but even this is being extra generous).

*His haircut: $50

*My waxing: $30

*Eating out: $150


We both get free gym memberships, health care is free, and we both get benefits. If we have kids (which we probably won't do), they'll have free day care, school lunches, and college. 


Should we pay off his loans right away and aggressively? E.g. $2000/month to his loans, and finish paying them off ASAP. Or, should we put just $500/month to his loans, and save $1500/month towards mine to pay a big lump sum all at once.

We'll have some expenses next year, that we have to travel back stateside, so flight tickets are something we have to save for. We don't know many people in the country, so there's no birthday gifts, or whatever. 

How much money should we save for discretionary purposes? How much towards loans? 


Any and all help/advice would really be appreciated!
