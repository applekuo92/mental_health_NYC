**About me:**

*Personal*

* 24yo
* 4 years married
* 2 kids (3yo & 1.5yo)
* Expecting 1 more at the end of January

*Employment*

I'm a full time, *remote* employee in the web/tech industry; I've been working in this industry since I became an adult. I started at entry level and now hold a Senior title; tenure with my current employer is approaching 2 years. My current employer (an agency) is well known/respected, large for our niche, and is generally a great place to work.
However, I've been growing tired of agency life for some time, and have recently started looking elsewhere for a non-agency workplace.

*Housing*

I live on the east coast in a rural area.
Almost exactly a year ago, my wife and I purchased our first home via a ~$225k FHA loan. We had a number of reasons to buy a home where we are; one by oneâ€“those reasons have ceased to be valid (not super important to detail why, but suffice it to say that we're not thrilled with our choice).

*Financial*

I make close to six figures. 6% goes to 401k; rest goes to mortgage, health insurance, bills, spending money (we're not tight, but not lavish by any means), and then the rest in savings (typically $300-$400 a month).

*My current situation/reason for posting:**

I got a random email from a recruiter at a great company in San Francisco; the email was personalized (not the usual spammy stuff). The company is looking to expand their engineering department, and reached out to me about a lead role, helping to grow/shape/define that team. **The role would be an onsite position.**

My dilemma: I'm not happy where I am geographically, in my employment, and in my status as a remote employee. I could *certainly* continue in my current state and live a comfortable life, but I'm not convinced my current situation is one that's tenable long-term.

Given that I am only1 year into a 30 year mortgage, make good money, and am financially comfortable, **am I a fool for seriously considering this change?** Giving it all up, packing up, and moving to San Francisco in pursuit of a job that excites me, and a city that has exponentially more opportunity for someone like me?
