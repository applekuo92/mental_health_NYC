I am 19, have a 630 credit score (I have had a car payment since june, never missed one), I've had a steady good paying job for a year and 3 months, I make in the neighborhood of $900-$975 every two weeks, and if I need to, I can put my car down for collateral. I'm looking to get $4,500. Would it be easier/more possible if I were to go through a credit union?
