Some time in the mid Nineties, An Iranian Ambassador was having a coffee with a Diplomat from the US. The conversation had turned to the culture of the two nations, both affording compliments to one another's respective countries. Soon, the Iranian Ambassador brings up his favorite US Export; Star Trek. "You know, of all the things your country produces, there is nothing my family and I enjoy more than watching Star Trek. The stories are incredible, the characters complex and the issues fiercely relevant" The US Diplomat smiles and nods. "I'm quite the fan myself!" He exclaims. The Ambassadors expression turns a hair more serious. "However, there is one thing I do not understand. Even decades ago, Star Trek depicted a future where all races and nations were in harmony. There were Asians, whites, blacks, even a Russian! I always wondered...why are there no Arabs?!" The Diplomat gives a coy smirk. "Well, you said it yourself. It's a harmonious future"
