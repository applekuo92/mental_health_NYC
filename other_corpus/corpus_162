I am 20 something  male who just landed first real job starting at 50k a year. I'm reading up or 401ks and IRA and such as I have neither. Now I understand to Max at 401k. I was also reading on here and many pay mention the 2008 financial crash... what people mean when they say half of retirement saving s were lost.  If it happened before why do people suggest to invest so heavily into 401k when they can just go bottom up in the future?
