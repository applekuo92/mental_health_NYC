We're all descended from a direct and personal ancestoral line dating back to the first single cell organisms on Earth. You, me, and everyone I know is the result of this unbroken chain. For me to not reproduce would not only mean I'm the first in my direct ancestral human line not to, but also the first in a direct line dating back to those early single cell organisms. 

Trippy...
