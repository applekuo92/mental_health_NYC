Husband makes $60k and I make $90k.  We owe $450k on a house that's currently worth $700k.   Two small kids.  $30k in each of our retirement accounts and a combined $20k in college savings for the kids.   This is in addition to 6 months worth of emergency savings for us should one or both of us lose or jobs. 

Husbands family has a poor health history of sudden death (usually heart related).   Otherwise he's in good health.  I too am in good health with no poor medical history.

We have no idea what kind of life insurance we should purchase;  how much, term or whole, etc.  any guiding principles would be helpful. 

Thank you!
