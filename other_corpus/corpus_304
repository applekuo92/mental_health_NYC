"Hi, Ray.  How are y-...wait.  Raymond Peter...*Ray P. Kriep*?  Guess your parents didn't think that through, huh?"

"My fault, actually.  I changed it from something else."

"What was it before?"

"Moe Lester."

"Yikes.  What kind of parents..."

"That one's my fault too.  Had to drop my birth name in a hurry, and there was no time to think."

"What was it?"

"Donald Trumppe."
