Hi.  So my wife may have a PT job.  The business she is joining will have 3 employees with my wife.  I don't know if they will sponsor a 401k plan.   What options would my wife have to contributing to a 401k plan?

Myself - I am starting a new job with the fed gov't.  My last job sponsored and funded an HSA? plan.  I have no funds in that account that I can access.  New job allows me to contribute to an FSA plan.  Would I be able to do that this year?  Or do I have to wait till 2017?  Im only allowed to start an FSA plan within 60 days of my start date which was a week ago.

Thanks
