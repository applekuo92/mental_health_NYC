There are so much things that could influence your opinion on a movie. 

For example:
When you are watching it, where you are watching it, with who you are watching it, is there a silence in a theater, hate train, hype train, theme of a movie, pacing of a movie, actor/director that you like, actor/director that you hate, nostalgia, faded memory of a film watched as a kid or something...

And I could go on and on...

There is a high chance, that, in some other circumstances, you would end up liking a movie that you didn't like, or other way around.

Very rare people are judging a movie based on it's quality.

Now, I am not saying, that movie can lack entertaining value or something, but judging a movie solely on whether you like it or not, or because you jumped on a hype train is wrong, because it is a subjective thing.
