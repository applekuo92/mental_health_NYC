*Edit*: In NYC


I'm a freelance consultant & software developer.  I know that I can deduct miles driven to my clients as well as money spent on food & gas spent with them.

However over the past 8 months I have also worked on a side project for which I've established a separate LLC.  I am not paid for this time & there is no 'client' per-se.  However I drive a similar distance & spent similar money on gas & food. Not to mention servers, software, etc.  Can I deduct that as a business expense?  

If not, since there are two separate LLCs, if one paid the other an amount of money (even a nominal one) would that be sufficient to show that business is being conducted?
