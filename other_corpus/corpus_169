tl;dr: I recently moved and am trying to sell my old property. The first buyer tried to get an FHA loan, but the inspector said there was less than two years of life left on the roof and won't approve it unless I pay to put a new roof on.  I have a second party interested in a "Rent to Own" deal and they will take care of the roof themselves.  Which option causes the least potential issues?

Detailed Verson:

I am going to try and keep things relevant, but there's a lot of factors that I am trying to balance out here.  It started when my wife's father died and her mother moved in with us.  Our little 1000 square foot house was no longer big enough for my wife. We went looking for a new property, and found one that we all loved that would fit the new size of our household.

I had the original house in my name alone, because I purchased it when I was single.  I have a 15 year mortgage with a low interest rate, and the payments are less than $700 a month.  I have no other debt.  Student loans are paid off.  My 14 year old car is paid in full.  My wife's car is paid in full.  We use two credit cards (one for me and one for my wife) for expenses and pay them off completely every month.  My credit score is great.  With my wife's income and my own (take-home about $4,500), we're fine.  My wife has always spent too much, a relationships issue really, and we had to replace the A/C at the old house so we have no savings to speak of. Yeah, I am ashamed of that.  There was a time when I did have six months of expenses saved up.

Anyway, her mom "gifted" us $10,000 towards the down payment.  Officially, this is a gift.  But, it's really a 0% interest loan that we need to pay back.  I went, with my wife, to get financing for the new house and we were initially denied.  Credit score too low.  Credit card balances too high!  Uhm, what?!

Turns out, my wife had credit cards in her own name that I was aware existed but didn't know she had maxed out.  They were supposed to be for rebuilding her credit score and paid off each month.  She'd been hiding it from me and paying them with money from extra she was making on her paychecks.  In total, it's ~$10,000 at a weighted average of 25% APR.  I don't know the full details of this until after sitting down with her later and getting it all out in the open.  But, I push through with trying to get a mortgage.

Fortunately, depending on how you look at things, my income, credit, and lack of debts is enough to get me approved for an FHA mortgage on my own without her income.  I hate the extra I have to pay with this mortgage type, but whatever.  We get the approval and buy the house we loved, knowing it needed about $6,000 in landscaping work to make it functional for our dogs.  Hurricane Matthew tears through just recently, and adds a bunch of tree removal costs to that figure and brings it up to $7,000 total.  The storm does not do enough damage to approach our deductible, so it's all out of pocket costs.

We find a buyer for the other house, at the bottom of what I want to take for it, and everything is fine until the FHA inspection denies the house because of the age of the roof.  Now, we could pay $9,000 for a new roof and lose that much more on the sale of the house, or we can back out.  The other big issue is that we can't even get roofers to schedule their work.  Everyone is booked three plus months into the future because of roof damage from the hurricane.  So, even if we wanted to pay that money, we can't get a roofer.

In steps our landscaper who can only get approved for $100,000 for a house.  He wants to do a rent to own agreement for the house, paying us $1,100 in rent each month and giving us a lump sum of extra from his business profits at the end of the year to bring the total amount of the house down.  He's willing to "pay" the current asking price.  If the roof does actually fail or develop problems while he lives there, he trades labor with a friend of his that does roofs and he will just put a new roof on at his own expense and for much cheaper than I could afford to.

It seems like the best solution.  It takes the $700 mortgage and the ~$150 monthly utilities off my current budget.  But, it means we don't get to just pay off all the wife's cards.  We can take the extra and put it towards the cards.  It also means my mother-in-law has to wait for her money (which she says is fine).

Concerns:

* How do I handle the lump sum of extra money he wants to use to bring down the price left on the house?  Putting it on the mortgage itself would be bad if the deal falls through and I need to pay him back.  I am afraid it would be counted as taxable income for me.
* He doesn't like credit or banks.  He will pay in checks or cash and wants to just keep receipts as proof.  This is more risky for him, I think, but I am concerned about it looking like I am dealing with undocumented income.
* My insurance and property taxes will go up, but they should still be less than his monthly payment.  It might not be enough less to contribute towards the purchase of the house, how do I protect myself in that case?
* Could I be getting scammed or screwed here?  I am going to find and speak to a real-estate attorney and have them draw up the contract that represents my desires and protects my interest, but I am not even sure I know all the questions to ask.
* This will cost me more in credit card interest and personal stress (mother-in-law debt), but may save me more than enough money in commission fees on the sale that makes up for those.
* I am currently in contract with a realtor to sell the house.  They are willing to release me from that for the expenses that have incurred and they say I might owe the title agency some money for the work they have done.  My contract says that they can come after me for the commission if I sell the house before the end of the original contract date (Feb. of 2017).  Would this rent to own contract be considered a sale they could demand commission on, since it was entered during that window?

I think that's it.  I am speaking with a real estate attorney this week, trying to find one first, and going to pay them to make sure I don't mess up.  Is there anything I am over-looking?  Would it just be better to find the money and put a new roof on the house and relist it a little higher to try and recoup some (not all) of the cost?
