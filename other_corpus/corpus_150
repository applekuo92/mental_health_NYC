I understand, in space, "Relative" is everything. So relatively speaking of course

Bonus Question: Given the rate of expansion of space, how much farther must these two galaxies travel to reach each other, over the course of the trip, than the "current measured distance apart".....again I understand that what we "See" now is not the current "real" distance from Andromeda due to the speed of light.
