My company has a very liberal 401K loan policy. I have about $25,000 in my 401K and it will be fully vested next summer, which by then should be close to $30,000 (estimate). By next summer my student loans will be down to about $20,000.

I've been toying with the idea on taking a loan out of my 401K, once fully vested, to pay off the student loans that way the interest i'm paying on the loan is to myself rather than disappearing to thin air. This would also take two payments (one private, one FSL) and take it to one. I'm only 30, so I still have plenty of time before I retire to pay it back.

It also appears that my monthly interest rate would drop from 6.9% & 8% to about 5.5% saving me money there too. A few co-workers in passing said they did the same thing and it made their lives easier.

I've always paid my loans off aggressively but this option does sound very appealing to me. Doing some rough math, it looks like my monthly payments would go from $600 a month to about $400 a month and I'll save myself close to $2,000 over the course of a 5 year loan in interest that I wouldn't get back.

So for the convenience of one lower monthly loan payment and paying interest to myself is this a good idea?
