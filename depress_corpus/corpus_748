I have this friend I often text when I'm feeling down, but lately I haven't been able to bring myself to do it. I feel like I'm bothering him by repeating the same stuff over and over, and as he also is my school-buddy I don't want to ruin our relationship by always whining. It's just that.. I don't know, somehow it helps to just tell a friend that I'm sad, so that I won't be all alone with it. DAE feel this way?
