Most people here probably have an idea of how they can help themselves. We're just too depressed/apathetic to put those ideas into motion. Can anyone relate or know how to get the ball rolling in the first place?


Edit: Wow, had no idea this thread would resonate with so many people. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not alone and hearing your stories is giving me that little push to, you know, do something.
