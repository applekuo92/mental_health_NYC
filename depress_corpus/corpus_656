I have a childlike fascination with everything. I am delighted by the natural world - discovering a plant or beetle I've never seen before, walking in the forest, sitting by the ocean, gazing at the moon and stars, listening to music and language - these things fill me with such intense awe and joy. I feel a purpose and a connection to this planet.

50% of the Australian Barrier Reef died this Summer. A new coral reef was found in the Amazon but we're already dumping oil all fucking over it. We don't do fucking anything about suffering and inequality. We fill our brains with bullshit clickbait, disposable coffee cups and disposable everything, porn with fake pleasure and fake orgasms devoid of all emotion, fake conversations, fake personalities, fake emotions, instant gratification everything, bullshit news, bullshit fucking everything. 

How can humans be so great, so miraculous, so talented, so capable yet so completely selfish, shallow, robotic, consumerist? I feel like we are a shitty dystopian fantasy novel.

Everything I love is being destroyed.
