Fuck you if you categorize all suicides like this. This isn't depression over a relationship breakup, monetary problems or grief over a loss. I've had severe treatment-resistant depression for 30 years now. I've been through countless antidepressants, multiple mood stablizers, TMS, and the shrooms and ketamine I've recently ordered from the dark web. Yet I still am chronically depressed and go to bed every day wishing I won't wake up. I live off disability and my mom takes care of me. This is not fucking temporary. It is permanent. "Oh continue living because in 20-40 more years there might be a new pill will be developed that will alleivate your depression!."

When you have a problem **the permanent solution is always the best.** You don't seek to temporarily fix a problem. You seek to permanently fix it.

This is why this fucking useless platitude and the cunts who espouse it en masse boil my blood.

If you have gambled at a casino for 30 years and lost every time, it's perfectly rational and acceptable to quit. Enough becomes enough.
