...or even just sadness in general. He talks here about the grief of losing his father and two brothers in a plane crash when he was ten [(source)](http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/playboy-interview-stephen-colbert?page=3):

> The interesting thing about grief, I think, is that it is its own size. It is not the size of you. It is its own size. And grief comes to you. You know what I mean? I’ve always liked that phrase He was visited by grief, because that’s really what it is. Grief is its own thing. It’s not like it’s in me and I’m going to deal with it. It’s a thing, and you have to be okay with its presence. If you try to ignore it, it will be like a wolf at your door.

In the past I would always think of my self loathing as a symptom of something wrong with me. That is, I thought it was in me and I have to deal with it. And my repeated failures to deal with it just made me feel worse.

It's far more straightforward to want to attack the negative feelings I've held close for most my life. Get rid of the negativity. But the strategy that has actually worked best for me was to find happiness independent of my depression. And little by little, positive things took more and more focus, until the negative was no longer dominant. Relevant, yes, but not dominant.

Anyway, these are just thoughts I had that I thought might help others. Hopefully it helps.
