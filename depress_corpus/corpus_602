80% of people with depression go untreated. Are any of the tens of millions of undiagnosed sufferers coming out for attention? God, no.

Even if 99% of the people you meet are faking it, the potential of further hurting that 1% outweighs any skepticism worth expressing. 

People like you make it harder for others to come out. Consider how hard it must be to add "am i faking it?" to the self-doubt that plagues you. Not feeling entitled to your own pain makes it harder to fight that pain.

"Mental illness is like fighting a war where the enemy’s strategy is to convince you that the war isn’t actually happening."

Don't make that war any harder than it already is.


P.S. how tf does it harm you to express concern for the not afflicted? does it make you look dumb? do you feel stupid afterwards for being fooled? would you rather be kind and mistaken or cynical yet correct?
