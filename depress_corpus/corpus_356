Does anyone else feel almost...fetishized when people who know that you wanna die campaign so hard for you to Not Kill Yourself but then they don't take any action that actually helps you? Like, I would never expect someone to overextend themselves or do me favors that they can't afford to do, but I just wish that if someone isn't prepared to actually do something about my situation, they wouldn't fucking tell me to not kill myself. It just makes me feel even shittier. 

It's not like I wouldn't try to live and survive and feel better if I knew what steps to take and was strong enough to take them. But no, I literally fucking CAN'T so unless YOU are prepared to somehow turn my "can't" into a "can", I don't want to hear a word out of your mouth about how I shouldn't kill myself because IT. JUST. MAKES. ME. FEEL. WORSE.

Edit: a lot of people are making assumptions and projecting a lot of things in these comments. I want to clarify that I can appreciate that friends, family, etc genuinely care even if they don't know how to help or do not have the resources to help. THAT IS FINE AND OKAY. What's not okay is them telling someone what to do (not kill myself) if they are not able and willing to contribute actionable efforts to help get a suicidal person to a better place. Because I don't feel like killing myself because I **want** to--I don't!!!--it's because I feel like I have to and am currently unable to adjust my life to where I won't feel like that anymore.

Like, are you gonna pay the hospital bills for checking myself in? Are you gonna find me a therapist who is actually helpful and doesn't disregard or dismiss things that are intertwined with my issues? Are you going to pay for my costs of living while I lie in bed for the 2-6 months it takes for medications to start working? No? Okay, well then here starts my search for a very tall balcony to jump off of.
