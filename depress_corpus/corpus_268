She's in one of my classes. I was out at a party and headed back home because I got bored and sad. On my walk back Jessica started shouting out my name and ran up and hugged me. It made me feel happier inside :) Just that enthusiasm really got me happy for a moment. Still depressed of course but it's the little things. Her and I never hung out or anything. Just kinda talked about how hard our class is because we sit near each other. It's cool to see that people actually do notice me and care. Happy Halloween everyone
