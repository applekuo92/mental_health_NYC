Does anyone else feel this way? I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona when I'm with my friends sometimes. I'm that "funny laid back chill dude" who is "nice" and "caring". Although I may be nice and caring, inside, it's different story. I hate myself so much. But I also don't want to confide because I have no true close friends, I only have friends who are a step above acquaintances.
