During the extra-long vacation after my exams this year I have been coping with depression . I feel like over time it became worse, and harder and harder to even get out of bed, let alone prepare for university which is starting in 4 weeks.

Today though, I pushed myself to excercise. So I did. I pushed every last bit of energy that I had out of my body, and then continued until I just couldn't anymore.

And now I feel something that I haven't felt for a long time. And that is the lust to go do stuff. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do now.

And mayby tomorrow will be shit, and the weeks after that too. But I'm ready for it. I will survive.

EDIT: thank you all for your kind words, you are wonderful people! :)
