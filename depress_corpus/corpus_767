I hate halloween. Everyone is having fun today. Well, NOT ME. I don't even know what "fun" is anymore. I can't turn on my radio or even tv, because all I hear/see is people getting ready to have a good time tonight. I'm not logging into facebook/instagram, because, all I see is PEOPLE HAVING FUN!

I just want this weekend to pass-by ASAP, just so I could dive into my work again.



*Sorry, I just wanted to vent. I hope I didn't bother you too much.*


EDIT: Thank you guys for the replies. It really makes me feel more comfortable, knowing that I'm not the only one.
