Now first off I feel it's imperative to say that I haven't officially been diagnosed with anything; in fact I haven't even talked to anyone about how awful I've been feeling the past year or so.  However I feel I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, I do not feel suicidal at all).

I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but I was thinking that if I did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication I would not feel comfortable with taking it.  I mean for one, I have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  Even just talking to someone I feel like I wouldn't properly be able to open up about what I've been going through. 

...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, there are times where I am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  I feel like I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I mean I have a great job, I'm only 23, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   

It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.  I just feel as though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible.
