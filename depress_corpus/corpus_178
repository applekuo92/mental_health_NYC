The little victories really are the best. 

This is the feeling I have been working towards for so long. My motivation is slowly coming back.

 I'm beating this. 

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the amazing supportive comments. 
This community is amazing and I am very lucky to be able to post in a sub where people understand and can give me the validation I need for completeing a task many people see a "simple".
It isn't. It's hard. It's climbing a mountain and crossing a desert. 
To everyone who has managed to do something 
today whether it was just get out of bed - well done.  You kick ass. 

We are beating this and we will all get there.
