Perhaps I get too emotionally invested (I can't even watch emotional movies because I just can't stop thinking about them all day) in the news and the world, but sometimes I feel like non-depressed people are just good at being distracted. Ignorance is bliss, right? I feel like some people can easily shut off the problems of the world and feel hopeful still, and others can't and they are depressed. But really, when the odds of "things working out" (for our futures and the worlds) are statistically against you... Unless you are really good at distracting yourself, how can you actually feel positive deep down?

I don't know. I am able to distract myself most of the time, but I am never unaware that I am simply giving in to distraction (which makes it hard to fully enjoy oneself).
