Even though I'm surrounded by loving friends and family, I feel very empty inside. The worse end of the human condition. It doesn't subside unless I find something externally stimulating, but once that passes away, the loneliness and emptiness creeps in again. Any meaning that I've been able to derive out of social relationships don't hold much very for me now, because I've realized people don't actually give a shit. It is all so crippling and somedays I barely find motivation to do anything.
