Well I overdosed on sunday with the absolute intent of dying....turns out I didn't and was taken to hospital. Anyway, the suicide note I had scheduled to be released 3 days later and later thought I cancelled (so my parents didn't have to do it) did not actually cancel.


So then I had people calling, messaging, posting and texting. And it was a fucking *BLESSING!!!* never in my life have I felt my friends cared for me so much as in that moment.


Now I am not a vaguebooker which is why I got this response and I don't suggest you try it at home but for me I have reconnected with years old friends and actually feel like maybe I could try treatment instead of killing myself.
