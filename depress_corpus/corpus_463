I'm lost for words, this is exactly what I need, it's only a 10 hour contract, but there's room for more shifts as and when, and to be completely honest, that's perfect for me!  Having recently been declared unfit for work, this is the best way for me to get back into it, and well, today is a pretty awesome day as opposed to the shit I felt like when I woke up.

This, just, yeah!

Ive been job hunting since september, now I can finally stop selling all of my music equipment just to put food on the table!
