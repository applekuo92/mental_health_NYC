I've been blabbering a lot today and it resulted in some comments with negative karma and whenever it happens I get very offended by it. I keep checking my comments' scores and replying to people, trying to explain myself and be funny and chill. What the hell is wrong with me? Why do I care about what random people on the internet think? Why do I take it so seriously when I know I'm not really a stupid troll? Why in my mind a downvote means more about me than the hundred upvotes I received before? I feel so stupid and I know my insecurity is pathetic. Caring what people think about you is understandable and normal, but it's not my classmates or my family! It's goddamn reddit and I let it crash my confidence. I feel dumb as hell.
