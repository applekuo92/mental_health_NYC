That's it really. Even on good days, I still feel like shit. Nothing is ever different. Nothing is ever better.

My entire existence is just a series of moments where I feel like shit, followed by moments where I'm too distracted to notice that I feel like shit.

The only time I ever feel okay is when I'm distracted. Video games, movies, whatever. But as soon as it stops, I feel awful again.

Fuck. That.

What is the point in continuing to suffer? Tomorrow isn't going to be any better, and neither is the day after that. I have years and years of evidence that shows tomorrow is going to be just as shitty as today.

Nothing is going to get better. What the fuck am I still doing here?
