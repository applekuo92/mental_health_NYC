I noticed that if someone is kind to me, I feel like I didn't deserve it. It makes me feel nervous. It starts with simple things, like at work, when a colleague does a favor for me, I always feel like I'm causing him trouble or I'm wasting his time.

Or when customers give me tip, I seriously would like to give it back to them immediately.

A few days ago, the cops pulled me over, I was probably going a little too fast, but they were super nice and even cracked some jokes, they just wanted to see if everything's alright, they were just randomly checking cars. I felt like I didn't deserve this kind behavior from an authority.


It's even worse with affection. When good things happen, like a girl showing me affection, I feel like they're just pitying me. During depressive episodes, I feel ugly and unlovable. I find myself denying the fact that genuinely good things can actually happen in life.

It seems like it's much easier for me to handle shitty and bad circumstances; bad things happening, catastrophes, death...I would embrace the apocalypse if it happened right now.
