I don't know how to act so people will be happy with me unless I bury it all. I have depression, PTSD, and EDNOS as a result of sexual trauma as a teenager along with ADHD that I was born with but I've come to realize that the only support group I've got and will ever have is myself and only myself. I do not consider my therapist or psychiatrist to be part of any support group, considering they're only around as long as you pay them.

Does anyone else feel the same?
