I'm lost. I'm so fucking lost. He was perfectly fine until just a few weeks ago. I moved to the other side of the country a few weeks ago.
I didn't know it was the last time I'd ever see him. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm a fucking idiot for not staying home.
I found out today after my mom called me crying while I was in class and I had a full on breakdown at school. 
He was the only thing who I felt genuinely appriciated and needed me. It's dumb right? 
I can't stop crying. I miss you so much, you big baby. 

I hope you're okay now, wherever you are.
