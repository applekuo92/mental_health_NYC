I can't really understand the logic behind how people react to severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts.  Why is it even considered acceptable to reject and invalidate how a person is feeling when it comes to such thoughts? And yet people who do this to others who are depressed still sit around scratching their heads when someone finally takes their own life.

Honestly, 99.9% of the time when I even dare to bring up feeling depressed/insecure/hopeless people cut me out of their lives.  That or they pummel me with a barrage of bullshit about positive thinking and how I should just "suck it up".  Then when I don't respond to it, they cut me out of their life.

I'm guessing it's just easier to reject someone than it is to comprehend there might be valid reasons why they lack the will to keep living?
