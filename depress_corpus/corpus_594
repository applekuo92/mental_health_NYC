So I've had depression for about 12 years now. 

Does anybody else get the impression that the only way to get people in the health profession to take your depression seriously is to try and top yourself off? 

Whenever I go to a doctor about my depression, the first question is pretty much always "Have you ever tried to harm yourself? Will you ever try to harm yourself?" and once I've answered no to both those questions, it seems like I'm basically fobbed off and put to the side while they go off to deal with the "really" depressed people. Then eventually they get around to me, give me a pat on the head and bunch of antidepressants, then send me on my way "see you in six months." 

Is this just an illusion? What are your experiences? For people that have attempted suicide, did you find you were taken more seriously afterwards or was the attitude towards you about the same?

Because honestly I am so at the end of my tether here that I'm thinking of strategically "attempting" suicide, just so I can get some proper treatment.
