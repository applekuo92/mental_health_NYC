After all the pain that I've endured, I'm decided now...

I'll not commit suicide, I feel better now, it will be the summer vacation tomorrow, even if I've failed my exam I'll not give up yet. I've talked to my parents about my problems, and it's better that I expected.

Well maybe in some years I'll want to end my life again, since I still weird about my future and about mankind, I don't really want to work for the humans, who are selfish, kills animals in mass to eat them, created inequality, well my dream would be to bring peace in that world.. but it's impossible...

Well... also I think that my attempt would fail, I don't have enough sleeping pills to kill me.

I have to think more about myself and what i will do in the future, but in first I'll enjoy my vacations.
