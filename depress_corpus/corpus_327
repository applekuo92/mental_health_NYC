Have I passed the point where I'm supposed to stop counting? I'm alone on my birthday. I have no friends and bad relationships with my family. I've never been married. I don't have any kids. I haven't had a significant other in over 20 years. Not that I haven't tried, mind you. I've had to endure more humiliating rejections than I care to remember. Apparently I was never quite good enough.

I always tear up whenever I see those ads on TV about animals who don't have a home with someone to love and care for them. How ironic it is that I would find myself in the same situation. At any rate, I'm still here, and I've all but accepted my fate. I'm not trying to fish for sympathy, but if any redditors out there can spare a kind thought for a moment for a lost soul, you have my heartfelt gratitude.

Thank you kindly for reading. :)

EDIT: OMG, thank you to everyone! I had no idea that doing this one thing would generate a response bigger than anything I expected. I guess being in my 40s, without a wife or kids or anything, I was feeling lonely, old and useless. But dammit, I'm not dead yet! Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I can't do things I still enjoy. And I really do love animals, so I'm going to think of a way that I can get myself to spend more time around them. Thank you, you guys have truly made this a happy birthday! :-)
