On my old account earlier someone used a post I made on /r/suicidewatch to humiliate me in argument here on Reddit.

I feel so violated. I'm such an idiot why didn't I just use a throwaway?  I'm so stupid. 

I hate myself. I'm very mentally unstable and that threw my completely off today. I completely lost it and exploded when he did this. 

I'm just done. There's no point in even trying to get help
