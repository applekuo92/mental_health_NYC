Most days I just feel depressed and lethargic. (Not hopeless, just frustrated and generally annoyed by life)

Other days, I feel fine, but my life and complete lack of self esteem feel more to me like a joke than anything, and I have a horribly self-deprecating and morbid sense of humor. But I just can't imagine a version of me without a self destructive mindset.

I must have been pretty depressed for most of my life, because I just have this horrible mindset that makes feeling less depressed seem like abandoning myself :P

(Not to mention that I think this mindset is making medication useless)
