I feel really strange. This is something I always wanted; I didn't really expect that.

So I was on my way home from school, which was really bad. I switched schools and most people seem to like me; at least when I'm pretending to be all happy and funny; but one person doesn't really like me and threatened me, because she wanted to sit where I usually sit. I almost broke down in tears.

After school I was waiting for my bus and a classmate called me; I was so anxious and confused since I never had anyone calling me for no reason. I was asked to wait for her at the bus station so we can drive home together; I had nothing to lose, so I decided to wait for her. Right in front of her house she opened her arms and I was all like "huh?"; she told me that she wanted to say goodbye and so we hugged.

I feel so strange and yet kind of happy; I don't know. I have no idea how I feel, but it was something that really brightened my day. I see all those sad posts on here and never posted something uplifting, but this is really an achievement for me that I wanted to share. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you don't mind me posting something positive and I hope that something like this will happen to you too. It doesn't cure me of depression or some sort; it just made me feel better for at least today.
