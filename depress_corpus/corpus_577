The worst part about my depression is that I have a good life. Thus far, I've got a whole list of achievements that other people are envious of. Sure, I'm not the most sociable person, and I've never really had a girlfriend at 21 years old, but I've done things that people didn't even know were possible. When I tell people some of the achievements I've made in my life, some people's jaws literally drop. When I show them how talented I am with games or coursework, I've had many in disbelief that I wasn't faking it somehow, and I've seen their eyes go wide with amazement.

I've fucked up here and there, made plenty of mistakes, but nothing that actually amounts to anything, not even a speeding ticket. I'm in college in a major I know I'm good at, and that I know I can get a job from right out of college.

I'm in shape, I'm relatively attractive, I've got a family that loves me, and I've got a bit of spending money on the side that my parents give me. I don't even have to work a job.


And it all makes me feel like shit. I'm severely depressed and I have been for almost 5 years now. No reason for it really... I just am. And it makes me more depressed that I have all this, and I'm not happy. I feel so undeserving of everything I've been given, that because I'm depressed that I'm taking everything I have for granted.

I'm not in debt, I haven't lost my job, nobody in my family has died, I'm not obese, I'm not disabled, I'm not addicted to drugs, I'm not anything that I feel qualifies someone to be depressed. I'm just a lazy antisocial white privileged male who has been handed everything in life and just hasn't been handed enough. Or at least that's what the depression tells me.
