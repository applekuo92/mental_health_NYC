My (21F) boyfriend of 6 months (25m) had no idea I was depressed. I have tried really hard to hold it together, but the last week or so I just hit breaking point. I'm at the point where I'm taking oxycodone every day the last few days to numb the pain. I **know** suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. I **know** it's the wrong choice and I need help. But I can't control my emotions, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest and I'm ready to do just about anything to get them off. 

I have three major concerns about suicide - I am terrified of hurting people around me. I am terrified of fucking it up and inflicting permanent disability on myself rather than successfully killing myself. And I'm terrified of the idea that I'll lay dead in my apartment for days or even weeks before anyone notices. I live alone, my family lives in another city. I have friends but it would probably take at least a week for them to put the pieces together and come and check on me. 

I recognised the need to tell someone and get help, and I opted to tell my boyfriend. We have been arguing for a few weeks but it still completely shook me that his response was to break up with me. I now feel really helpless. I tried to do the right thing and I mustered up the courage to tell someone, and it backfired. I am even more depressed and devastated that I am the 'crazy broken girl'. Now I have thoughts like "no wonder he doesn't want me anymore". I fucked everything up with him because I couldn't cover my depression up any longer. I'm convinced I'll always be this way - I can't cope with things that have happened years and years ago. 

I feel like he's treating me with tough love but that's not what I need. All I want right now is for him to hold me and tell me it will get better and he'll be there. Not "you're being silly, you don't want that, things can never be that bad". He obviously has no understanding of what I'm going through. I **know** things aren't that bad. I **know** there's billions of people worse off than I am. But that's what hurts even more - my logical brain knows these things, but my emotions are completely out of whack and I feel a different way. 

I'm lost. I'm hurt. I tried to ask for help and he walked away.
