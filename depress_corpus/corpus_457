Does anyone else get tired of hearing this?  

If you really want to say something to try and make me feel better, don't just spit out the world's most general comment. Please. It didn't help the first time I heard it, it's not going to help the 12th time either.

Edit: I've made my way through all the comments, and I have to say thank you to everyone who replied. It's nice to actually feel understood.
