Maybe it's really depression. Maybe i'm just slow and/or stupid. But i think everyone that believes our way of life is anything but completely incompatible with a healhty mind is fucking nuts

Everyone should just go away and leave me alone so I could focus on the voice inside my head that tells me to kill myself.
