So today was not a good day for me. Had a meltdown of crying in the kitchen this evening. She groks depression and anxiety, she suffers too, and we help each other out quite a bit whenever we're having a bad day. 

She walks into the kitchen, examines the boxes of Ritz on top of the fridge to make sure she got the butter garlic ones, then walks over to me. The box is turned on its face as she balances it on my head, steadies it, then backs up and asks frankly "Well, did it work?" in a very flat and confident tone. 

My brain goes from "hell no that didn't fix it, you dumb bitch" to "wait, did I miss a memo? Is this supposed to fix it somehow?" to "she's either mocking you or trying to make you laugh." 

Laughter won out, as I started laughing and crying simultaneously, the box of crackers falling off my head. I was worried for a split second that they were going to fall, and break, and that would be my fault too, but she caught it.  She started saying something like "I couldn't be sure if that would fix it, your manual was translated seven different times in three different languages, this is shoddy work." 

I don't know why it worked, but given how absurd her approach was, it got my brain out of the bootloop it was stuck in. 

Edit: I don't really think she's ever a bitch, that's just the rapport we have.
