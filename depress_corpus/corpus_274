I left the house with my phone, wallet, and a paper + marker to write my final goodbyes. I went to the bridge I planned on jumping off of but backed out at the last minute. I ended up writing a note about my decision and left it at the bridge to try and discourage the next person from jumping. I kind of regret not doing it but I hope my note saves a life so that my day wasn't a complete wash.

Edit: Thank you all. So much.
