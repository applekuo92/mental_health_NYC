Well against all belief, I somehow actually did it, I somehow managed to get the job I really wanted. And now I have my first full time job out of school despite feeling terrible before, during and after the interview.

 It feels surreal and I still don't quite believe it. I was literally having multiple panic attacks and contemplating suicide for the past few days because I was convinced I failed and wouldn't get it. I was honestly probably at the lowest point I can remember being in, I was ready to give up on life. And now it's like...I don't have do that anymore. I am lucky, unimaginably lucky.

Honestly, this was probably emotionally the hardest part of my life to get through and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I'm really hoping with this behind me I can start to get some control over my mental health and gradually build some more self esteem. 

Life is to short to waste feeling miserable like I have for years. And now without having to worry to worry so much about the job thing I can focus more on finding a new doctor and doing the things I enjoy.
