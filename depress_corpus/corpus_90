There's no "help" when the person is only talking to you because you're giving her fucking 90 bucks an hour. She only sees you as a source of money, how can that be "help" if that's the nature of the relationship with a therapist? That's why I can't bring myself to get a therapist, because what the fuck kind of bullshit arrangement is that?
