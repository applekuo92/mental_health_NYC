I hope that all of us get the appropriate help we need and someday turn our lives around, but let's be honest, today is probably not that day.

So may your bed be extra warm and your favorite re runs be on TV. I hope you get that unhealthily long sleep you want, and I hope your teachers and/or employers take it easy on you. I hope nobody makes it worse by telling you to "just be happy" or to take some vitamins for your depression. And I hope you don't feel too down on yourself.
