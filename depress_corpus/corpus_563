I honestly feel like I'm not allowed to enjoy cloudy weather or something. I just like it okay? But no its like it's only cause of my depression. I hate it when my feelings are invalidated like that. Bright, sunny weather just annoys and irritates me. But cloudy weather is nice, gray, and calm... I'm not saying people need to agree with me but at least respect what I feel good with without slapping "it's just depression" on it.
