I want so badly for it to be over. I sat on a bridge for an hour tonight, willing myself to do it and willing myself not to. I know that it would destroy my parents, my siblings, my friends. But I just want it to be over. I see no point to being alive, and I hate existing. But I can't kill myself because of knowing what it would do to the people who care about me. I know I'm not worth caring about, but they don't really know me, so they don't see the truth. But regardless, they care, and so I keep going, solely for their sakes.
