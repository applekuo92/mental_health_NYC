EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words, I didn't expect such feedback! And thank you u/greydestruction for the gold, I've never had it before! It means a lot that you guys appreciate it, and I'm glad I made something finally that people like. Thanks again, I love all of you and have a great weekend. :)
