It may be triggering. To be honest I don't really know where to post it, I figured r/drawing or r/comics would likely tear it to shreds. I know the drawings aren't the greatest. If this isn't appropriate for this subreddit please let me know. I guess I just felt like I needed to get this out.

Anyway, here it is - [Tuesday](http://imgur.com/a/dpmTO)


EDIT - Hey all, OP here -
I just want to say that I am blown away by the reaction to the comic I posted. I never thought I could affect so many people, in a positive way. If anything, let them know that they are not alone, and maybe give those who are not struggling with depression, low self esteem, or social anxiety, a glimpse into what it's like. 

In a way I helped myself. I was feeling incredibly down, alone, and depressed, and I still am. I'm going through a rough time right now, and it was truly, truly helpful to see that other people could relate to my feelings and understand what it's like to be always doubting yourself and the actions of others around you. Thank you all for your kind comments, it really gave me hope - that I could perhaps reach out and help others in some way. 

I sincerely hope all of you who can relate are able to stamp out your negative self talk, and rise above your depression or anxiety. Just know that you are not alone, and there are so many other people out there worrying about what THEY said, or if anyone truly likes THEM... it's easy to forget that when the depression and negativity has consumed your thoughts.

In closing I'd like to thank everyone again for your kind words. I appreciate it, and I hope that every one of you can beat this, because as we all know it's quite painful to live in this way. And I want to repeat what I've learned from this - You are not alone.

Hang in there.
