My friend's been missing for about 2 months. We met here, so I already have a bit of a hunch she might be going through a rough patch. I'm worried.

I only really know her as Bicycle. So with all the power of the internet, I have no way to check up on her. If you see this, please at least let me know you're alright. I understand if you're isolating, and I can handle being alone. But this worry is starting to get to me.

I'm posting this obviously in hopes that you'll find it, and to vent. I've began browsing this sub for about 4 hours a day, looking for anything that might resemble something you'd say. It's draining, and I give up. I miss you.
