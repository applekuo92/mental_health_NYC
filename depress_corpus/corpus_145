Let's be clear: I fucking hate running. I don't mind sports and I enjoy team sports but it's been donkey years since I last properly exercised. My depression and anxiety also got worse over the years but correlation =/= causation. 

The last couple of days I've been outside walking around the streets catching Pokemon. I'm surprised by how *nice* it feels to be out in the sun getting some physical activity even if it's just walking.

I've also just landed myself a cool new job and I REALLY want to make it work. I'm already on medication and getting psychotherapy organised for myself but I've also started considering incorporating some actual exercise into my life. I absolutely would not have considered it if I hadn't been playing Pokemon GO. I'd much rather hide at home and play video games forever.

Today I went to the mall to buy some cheapo exercise pants (those stretchy thick yoga leggings) and shoes. I didn't want to drop $200 on a pair of Nikes just yet so I got a [$20 pair of running shoes](http://www.kmart.com.au/product/delilah-running-joggers/891009) instead. I think they look pretty damn sweet. :D I've been wearing heaps of black clothes (reflective of my mood lol) so a pop of bright colours would be good for a change I reckon.

Tomorrow I'm going to try and run/walk ~4km. More walking I think, to do some reconnaissance around the city and find a good running route. I'm actually looking forward to it. I also hope to hatch a couple of Pokemon eggs while I'm at it. :3 

I know I shouldn't put too much pressure on myself and *be patient with the recovery process* but I hope to keep this momentum up for as long as possible.
