I want to help people on this subreddit with my experiences and pains but it's so hard for me to bring myself to hit post when all I feel is like my opinions and advice are useless,,
Edit: oh gosh ! I didn't expect to see so many responses on this. I really am truly sorry for everyone who feels like this. There are so many supportive people on this subreddit and reading what some of you guys wrote really made me feel wonderful. Thank you <3
