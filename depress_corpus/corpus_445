"Are you okay?"

"Hmm? Oh, yeah. I'm just tired."

It's the easiest excuse to use and the most believed one, too. 

It's true though too, on some level. You are tired. Tired of feeling bad. Tired of feeling lost. And lonely. And upset. And sad. And crazy. Tired of over-thinking and under-analyzing. Tired of losing yourself amidst the lies. Tired from sleeping too much or not at all. Tired of worrying. And fretting. And putting your life on hold because you can't just 'get over it'. Tired of pretending. Tired of hiding. 

It's alright.    
I'm just tired.
