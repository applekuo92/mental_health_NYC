I just have no motivation. My life is filled up with reddit, youtube, jerking off, cutting, and trying to move past being so bad. I haven't even showered yet and it's 7PM.

I don't think I've showered before 6PM on a weekend in years.

Edit: oh yeah, and I haven't brushed my teeth all weekend. Actually, I haven't showered all weekend.
