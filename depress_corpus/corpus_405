I've constant anxiety that if I mention one word of how I feel its gonna be taken as attention seeking behavior. When it couldn't be more less true. I've seen the fake tears some people pour out, the over dramatics they display. It makes me sick and I want to scream at them how much harder they are making it for people with a actual problem. Is there anyway to talk to a friend or family and not have to fear this?
