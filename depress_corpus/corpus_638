I know. It's difficult. I actually learned the hard way. And when the relationship ultimately ended I was crushed. My depression is "better" now(I'm more numb than anything). I learned that I can survive anything mentally. Even having the one person I love leave me, being nearly broke for 2 months,  and her finding a new guy within a week of leaving me, leaving him, then her getting impregnated by another guy. It hurt. Made me feel worthless and like she only stayed because she felt I'd kill myself if she left. 

Telling someone that they're your reason for living puts a lot of pressure on them. It may force them to leave one day because the task of pleasing you with depression seems too daunting and a lost cause. They may not understand and never talk to you again. Could you live with yourself after that? I barely made it.

However,  this is just my story and it may work out for you. It's just tough on the other person. Very. 

Live for yourself and those you wish to influence and inspire with your knowledge and experiences. Just some advice. I dont want anyone to go through what I did.
