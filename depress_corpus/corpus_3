I can't go on. Im after finishing a 26oz bottle of vodka hoping to numb the pain even a little but it fucking ddidn't work. Im in a secluded parking lot in my car staring at my gun and ignoring all 100+ missed calls and shit I cant deal with it. Im going to kill myself within the hour. 

Suppose I feel like I had to write this down somewhhere.
