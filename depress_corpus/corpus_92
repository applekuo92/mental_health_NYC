I just can't do it. People always say stuff like "that's life, welcome to adulthood" etc, I don't think they understand that I'm not just saying I hate my job, I literally refuse to live this way. The way I'm going, I know eventually I'm gonna reach my breaking point and blow my brains out.

It's not acceptable to be to just sell away my entire life to some company, working toward someone else's dream at the expense of my own. I would start a business except...what the hell is my business gonna do? Plus, the vast majority of those all fail anyway.

Society has basically been set up so you have two choices: Slavery or death. Every day I feel closer to picking the latter.
