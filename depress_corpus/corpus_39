I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, but the past year or so it's become a serious problem for me. I started seeing a therapist and started medication, and it's helped me tremendously. However, trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult. How do you articulate something that you've had your whole life? It's not like I really knew the other side, so to speak. It was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously.

SOâ€¦I made some photographs (all self portraits) that aim to describe how I feel. I've always been a more visual person anyway. Hopefully others find some type of comfort in this. Let me know what you think!
