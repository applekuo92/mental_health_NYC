I've been on medical leave from work to seek treatment. Few know where I am. Those who know have been telling those who ask some variation of "She's fine, just taking care of what she needs to." Three people know...all three have told that they've just been relaying that I'm fine.


The other day, my supervisor and I talked about sending the office an email about how I'm okay and fine (her exact words) with my expected return date


Fine. My apt. is a dumpster. I don't have real relationships. All I do is eat and throw up at 31. Never once have I uttered those words "fine", but others are saying it for me. I don't even know what I'm hoping for or want...but I feel like my illness is all made up in my head. If I had cancer, nobody would say I was fine. I get that they are protecting my privacy but at the same time it feels like it is "less" than a physical illness.  


I'm feel so suicidal lately but too numb to do anything about it. I'm unbearably lonely, sad and hopeless. I'm not fine. I don't want to go back to work with a fake smile plastered on, but I have to. Because depression isn't seen as a real sickness or as serious until suicide. 


Back when I asked for leave, my supervisor even told me to let people know it wasnt something "serious" so that people wouldn't worry.
