kind of a rant...

i have suffered from anxiety and depression pretty much my whole life. i ahve been on and off meds since i was 13. it is not something i am open about but if you know me well enough you can tell when i am having an episode. 

i have been having a rough month and accidentally snapped at a new girl at work. one of my friends talked to her and basically told her it wasn't her fault, i was just having a rough month. well this new girl decided she needed to come comfort me. remind you she does not know me, or anything about me. she comes up saying "oh i know where you're coming from. i have anxiety issues **giggle** to. my boyfriend thinks it is adorable."

WTF? none of this is adorable. and if you do actually have these issues and he thinks they are adorable, he is NOT healthy for you. 

i am just so sick of tumblr and other social media outlets portraying depression/anxiety as "hip" or "in". they are not cute or fun. they are awful, sometimes deadly diseases. 

sorry for the rant.
