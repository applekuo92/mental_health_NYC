Quite an achievement I'd say. It's my 23rd birthday tonight so I thought why not treat myself to one of those "basic human need" things?

Edit: You're one of the best reddit communities out there, really. I didn't know I needed this. I mean, I keep telling myself I don't care because I've given up already. But then you keep telling a stranger he's done well when he's trying the simplest things. I get it, too. We're helpful in helping people, we can cheer people up but we can't really help ourselves. And it's good to feel even the littlest encouragement, thank you. /drunk sentiments
