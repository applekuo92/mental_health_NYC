This is a depression subreddit. This is basically the home of long, sad, sometimes angry rants. This is where you're supposed to write that sort of thing and be understood. If you want to downvote sad things then go on a Sunshine Rainbow Sparkly Land subreddit where it's about being happy and not about being sad.

But here on /r/depression, you don't downvote sad things. Because everything here is sad. People are vulnerable here. Who knows, someone might see the downvotes and commit suicide because THAT is how much what people think of you matter to people here.

So next time you see something you don't like, THINK before you DOWNVOTE please. It hurts to see people hate on something very personal to you. It hurts to see people downvote a rant of pure emotion and loneliness. Recently, I wrote something from a VERY vulnerable mindset and it got multiple downvotes. It just kills me that not even an online DEPRESSION group is safe for people with depression.

It hurts me so, so much when I write something while crying alone in my room and it gets so many downvotes and nothing else, and it hurts when I see someone writing something, scared and alone, and it gets downvotes.

So please consider what people with depression are going through next time you see something you don't like.
