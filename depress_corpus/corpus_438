I'm severely depressed and it's effecting my life in crippling ways; It makes it nearly impossible for me to go to college because the pressure I face there gives me panic attacks and when I am there I feel unsafe and anti-social. To make things worse, the fact that I miss college piles guilt on me and makes everything a thousand times worse. I want to be in lessons, I really do but I just can't face it. 

When I'm off college, I just sit there and cry at home. Or try to take my mind off of it before something knocks me right back down again. But people, even my teachers, think I'm just skipping lessons or lazy and I'm sick of it. I'm ill but people don't see that because I'm not bleeding or physically broken. They tell me to "suck it up" and just force myself to go to college. But I can't, if I force myself then i'll hurt myself. 

The only time I'm happy outside is at my martial arts class, which I feel perfectly happy going it, but this doesn't help the fact people think I'm just bunking off college. "If you're well enough to go play sport then you're well enough for lessons." The teachers don't understand that it doesn't work like that. 

I just tell them I'm throwing up when I don't turn up because I'm too scared to explain myself and be laughed at and told off. I have just as much right to remove myself from lessons if it's hurting me then someone with a broken arm does. I'm hurt too. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. 

Does anyone else have experiences like this?
