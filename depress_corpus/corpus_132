No one will probably care and it probably sounds trivial but tonight I kissed a girl for the first time. It was something I never thought would happen. I was super awkward about it, but I'm trying to tell myself that doesn't matter. It was with someone I actually care about too and she didn't think being kissless at 20 was too weird at all. Or so she said. The thoughts of over analyzing are starting to take over but I'm fighting to give myself this one moment of happiness and to share the hope with you guys. I know their are people who are older and in the same situation. It will be awkward but it is not impossible and you can do it. The mantra that got me through it was "the first five seconds are the hardest part and after that it's natural". All I had to do was tell her id never been kissed and the rest would just flow from there, even if it was awkward and cringe worthy. Don't lose hope guys, never lose hope :)
