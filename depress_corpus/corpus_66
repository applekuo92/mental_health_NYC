It was really casual, for some reason. I changed all my passwords, reset my phone, took out my sim card, I told my mom I loved her, which I haven't done since I was 9, took my extra belt, and left into the woods. When I got where I wanted to be, I put my favorite song on. I tied the belt to a branch, and stayed in the tree for a few minutes to think for the last time before I go. But when I fell, it broke and I hit the ground. So I just walked home, and my sister was in the kitchen so I asked her if she liked Radiohead, she said no and then I went into my room and I tried not to cry but I couldn't really help it. This was just a few hours ago. I don't know if I should tell anyone
