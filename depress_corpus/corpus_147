Depression is something that, fortunately, not too many people suffer from. Unfortunately, that means that those who suffer from it are in the minority. This makes it a rarity that you'll come across someone who understands what you're going through when you tell them you have severe depression. 

Too often you'll get people who tell you to get over it, or you'll feel better if you smile. My brain feels like a holke I'm trapped in. I try to smile and be positive but keep getting sucked into despair by stupid triggers in my environment and myself (My impatience, when something or one is going slower than I like or just thinking about certain family members. When I'm triggered I have to struggle for about the next hour to get out of the pit of despair I fall inro.

That shows you depression is more than a mood to just get over. Depression and other mental disorders like anxiety and bipolar are disorders which little is known about and no one will talk about. I want this to change. I want to have an open discussion about how society sees mental illness. The only rule is no one insult anyone else in this discussion.
