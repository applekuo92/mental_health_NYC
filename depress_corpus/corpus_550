Sometimes I'll randomly not at all be upset about anything...I'll just feel a complete indifference for everything around me that makes me want to close my eyes and just die because the unbearable boredom is so fucking dull, and what's the point in doing something that feels pointless?

Small talk with people in my classes? It's boring, and I don't have the energy for it.

Study for my test tomorrow? Sure, I'm learning about really cool science that people use to understand the world and invent things, but it's just boring. Don't feel like it. Don't care if I fail. Don't care if I pass. Both scenarios are boring.

Take my dog on a walk? Boring. Can't even bring myself to pick up the leash. That would take too much energy.

Read this online article on a subject I used to really be intrigued with? Nah, don't care. Don't feel like it.

It's a really scary feeling when it happens. Almost like I'm slipping into death and something chemical in me is making it impossible to feel anything about anything. And I'm so fucking tired. And I just want to die because what's the point of sitting here for hours bored?
