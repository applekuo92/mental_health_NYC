I tidied my room! Well, in the process of tidying. It's a fucking tip. for the last 2 weeks I've done nothing but sit around the house being very, very low, with thoughts of self harm. But today, I've just gone crazy on my room, with multiple disinfectants, multiple bin bags and even some dancing, im cleaning. I feel good for the first time in a long long time, even though today is a very sad day for me. But I've got a new friend who motivates me, and for that i'm very thankful.

It's been an interesting few months, but for the first time in a long time, I'm not at rock bottom. Im very thankful. It's like im cleaning away my sadness or some bullshit metaphor. 

Point is, cleaning woot!
