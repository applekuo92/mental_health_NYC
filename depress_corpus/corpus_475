i can't believe tomorrow I'll be a year older. A year ago things were so different. I was going to make something of myself, I was going to be someone. I was going to change the world and be a good person, and now when I look in the mirror all I see is a selfish coward who's accomplished nothing and lost everything in a span of a year.

I don't know how much more I can take, what's the point of fighting if you've got nothing to fight for? No dreams, no goals, no talents, no future, no friends, just nothing. My birthday each year is just a reminder of how little all the people around me care. Even my dad forgot my birthday. It would be just so fucking poetic if I just fucking died tomorrow, on the day life started for me all those years ago. Makes me laugh thinking about it, it would be something straight out of a Sylvia Plath poem.
