I'm in college, and my major requires me to do tons of outside work. It's not homework, but it's very required. I don't want to give away my identity, or I'd better explain what I mean. Anyways, I just don't want to do any of it. I can't make myself do it. Pretty soon, the end of the semester is gonna be here, and I'm gonna be screwed because I haven't been doing what I need to. It's not laziness, it's not procrastination. I just can't bring myself to do it. It would be nice to talk to someone else that really suffers from this particular symptom.

Also, does anyone else here have dysthymia, rather than depression?
