First of all, I am making this post as more of a rant than a cry for help because i'm pretty sure I can guess all of the advice I will receive. I just have no one to talk to, and I really need to rant.

To begin, I have been depressed for the better part of 4 years. I just graduated college and I feel like I learned nothing. And that I am so completely unprepared for the real world that I don't even know what job I would want to apply for. I really want to enlist in the army infantry, but when I told my parents about considering it, I received no support from them (which is understandable).
I don't socialize with new people. During the past year at college, I have gone out to the bars one time with my friends. My social anxiety goes through the roof whenever I go out anywhere, so I just decide to embrace being the loner I am by staying at my place night after night. Girls are non-existent in my life. I don't go out, so I never give myself the chance to meet girls. I don't talk to them, and they don't talk to me. Shit, even my "friends" don't talk to me or even send me a text asking how I have been. My last girlfriend was in my freshman year of college, and she was my absolute best friend. I told her every little "secret" I had, and didn't hold back any details of my life. And she ended up dumping me after she had enough of my sadness, and "didn't want to be dragged down with me". So after that experience, I haven't allowed myself to get close to anyone (including both family and friends).
Right now I feel boxed in and that there is no escape from my own personal on-earth hell that I have created for myself. I want to get professional help. But I am afraid to even talk to my parents about considering it because that means that I have to tell them the truth about my life. How the "happy face" I put on throughout the past 4 years and all of the happy stories were all a lie just so that they wouldn't freak out. I feel like a failure, but I have no motivation to do better. I no longer have the confidence or motivation to take necessary risks to further myself in life. I feel sad, lonely, and lost. I am hopeless.

**EDIT:** Wow, this received so much more attention than I anticipated! Thank you all so much for your kind words, personal messages, and hugs =]  It might not seem like much, but knowing that this many people are listening to me and actually offering help and support means **SO** much to me. Reading all of your replies has brought me to tears and I hope that I can use/apply everything you all have told me to better myself and my outlook on life. I already love this community and I will make sure to keep in contact with those who have asked! You all are the best and I am sending hugs back to all of you =]
