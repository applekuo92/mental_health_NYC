Does anyone else feel this way? if committing suicide wouldn't affect anyone in my life I'd probably just kill myself eventually and be done with all the pain. It just seems so hopeless, knowing that possibly for years to come I will feel like this. I just wish it would go away so that I could have a normal life.

Edit:

Just so you guys know I am NOT suicidal. I sometimes I wish that I could just end it, but I know that I cant. I have too many people that care about me to be able to throw it all away. I just couldn't do that to my friends and family.

Edit:

Thank you all for the love and support, it helps keep me going :)
