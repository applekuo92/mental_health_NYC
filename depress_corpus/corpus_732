Day after day I sit here in my room and do nothing, but I always feel like there just isn't enough time. For example; I want to play a video game or watch a movie but that takes time so I don't do it. I want to do my homework, but that takes a lot of time and effort and no one is making me do it, so I don't.

The only place where I do usuful things are at school, being distracted by tasks I have to do is the only way I can be productive. Even better when I get to leave early if I am fast enough.

I just don't understand it, why do I feel like this when I should have all the time in the world?
