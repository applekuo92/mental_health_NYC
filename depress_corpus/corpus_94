I am mentally ill and I am not a bad person because of it. I am not useless. I am worth more then a bed in a hospital and a prescription. I am capable. I am worth getting a job. Getting a degree. Falling in love and starting a family - no matter what society and the media may try and tell me.

Please share your story - 

A moment where you saw someone being harassed for being mentally ill and how you stepped it

A moment you were discriminated or a friend/family member/loved one was discriminated

Actions you and/or your community are making to break the stigma.

Questions you may have about mental illness that you were always just too embarassed to ask

After being on reddit for a long while... I really think you guys and girls will help make a difference - if anyone could it's us reddit!!!!!! I posted on r/depression because there are the most redditors profoundly suffering here - ive been getting help and giving advice on this subreddit for quite some time. I knew you guys would be the place to post this. 

EDIT: over 600 upvotes! cant believe it!  (i'm ignoring down votes. cause seriously. we're thinking positive here) these stories are inspiring and the non-judgmental atmosphere is so appreciated. a lot of people have been courageous in sharing their stories and helping others - thank you so much! keep them coming they're inspiring :) 

 **Everybody's "brand" of mental illness is welcome here. Nobody is excluded!**

(*i've been getting some comments for using a throwaway account - i used a throwaway account so that this thread would be about you - not about me or my karma. if anyone would like to know more about my story/identity please feel free to ask/PM this account. i will be following this thread till it flickers out*)
