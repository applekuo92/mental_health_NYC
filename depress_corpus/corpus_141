Hello /r/drepression, 
my name is Lukas,
some of you may have read the post i made 30 days ago. I tried to take my own life and documented in this subreddit. after i went through different hospitals and had the worst and most painful night of my life i am recovered health-wise. I made this post to tell those who were actually worried that i am alright. I could some "It gets better"-bullshit here, but i am a terrible liar. I still want to die but i've learned that there are people whose happiness is worth more than my pain in living. I am in a psychiartric hospital in a stationary therapy and i would like to apollogise for being so discouraging in this subreddit. i am sorry. 

I wish you the best and ofc happiness since happiness is the most valueable thing for all of us. 

Thanks for your attention,
Lukas
