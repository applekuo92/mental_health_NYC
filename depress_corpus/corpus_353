After being best friends with my neighbor during middle school and high school, we sort of drifted apart after graduation (juniors in college right now). But we live right next to each other so it shouldn't be hard right? 

He almost never invited me to hang out with my other friends during the summer so I was stuck at home doing nothing and they consistently posted it on social media for two summers straight. 

I finally got the courage to text him today and ask him if he wanted to get food. His response was "I'm sorry, who is this?"

The sad thing is that he's the only contact in my phone that isn't a family member..
