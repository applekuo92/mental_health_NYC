I find myself doing it a lot, admittedly a lot of times it's romance and sex but other times it's just imagining normal human interactions. It gets especially bad when I read an event in a book or watch one in a movie and start daydreaming about myself doing something in those situations. 

The worst is when I fantasize about some upcoming thing, like recently attending a college class for the first time, and having a perfect image of how it's going to go. Then I actually go and all my hyped up expectations are shattered.
