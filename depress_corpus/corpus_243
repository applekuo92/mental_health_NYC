Came up with this a few years ago. 

**Step 1**: Take shower in the dark, water at comfortable warmth. Try to get the room as dark as you can.

**Step 2**: Whenever you feel like it, sit down in the shower, water running on your head. Close your eyes and cover/plug your ears.

**Step 3**: Imagine as hard as you can that you are not in your shower. Place yourself into the following story, and fill in as many details as you care to.

"You are stranded alone on a lifeless planet in which it never stops raining. During the day, the rains are quite warm. But at night, they become frigid. You are trapped outside your one person spaceship and are sitting alone on a hill, overlooking the barren, grey wasteland without your spacesuit on. You can breathe here, but soon the water will be so cold you'll be killed by it instantly. This is the end for you, and you know it. You refuse to panic, though. Instead, you will think about your life." 

**Step 4**: Every once and a while, reach over and lower the temperature to your shower. Ponder the lonesomeness you feel in this rainy world that you'll never escape. If you feel like thinking about what is in your own life, feel free, but don't let it take over the main story, the icy and frozen planet.

**Step 5**: Once you get to a point of near uncomfortable coldness, wait a minute, then bring the temp down nearly as low as you can on your nozzle. Try to endure it for 10 seconds. Don't be afraid to let your body feel some of the shock from the cold. (But of course, don't do this to harm/punish yourself for anything.) 
Quickly turn the heat back up, take a moment or so, turn the shower off, and get out. Dry off. Lay in bed or just find a way to get warm and comfy again. 

Now the person trapped on the icy and dead planet is gone, they've died. But you, the *real* you is still here. You have escaped that awful place, and are ready to move on and face the next challenge in your life, and you can do it. Because this is the real world, and that icy, cold, hopeless planet exists almost entirely your own mind.

The exercise, the way I see it, helps us to recall that depression, while influenced by outside events and problems, is mostly internal. I do it every once in a while when I'm really low, and I've felt like it's a great way to end a terrible day with a bit of hope. Have a good week, everyone :)
