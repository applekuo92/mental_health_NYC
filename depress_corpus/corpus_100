Have to get out of bed? Nah, don't feeling like it.

Get up and take a shower? Fuck that shit.

Clean my room? I'll do it tomorrow.

Apply for a job? No one will hire me anyways.

Go on a walk to get some sunlight and fresh air? Too tired.

It works the other way too, naturally. All the shit you want to do is stuff you shouldn't do.

Sit around all day and play video games? Shouldn't do that.

Stuff my face full of burgers and sodas because food is one of the only things that makes me feel good? Bad idea.

Stay at home and sulk instead of going out to do something with actual human beings? Not wise.

I feel like it's just a part of human nature to enjoy things we're not supposed to do but I feel like this is exacerbated in cases of depression. Every single freakin' fuckin' thing you feel like doing is a bad idea and every single thing you really with all your heart don't want to do can help. It's like my mind doesn't even want to get better. It's amazing how we deceive and sabotage ourselves.
