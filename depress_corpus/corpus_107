Yes I know, something so simple. For the past few days I haven't left my room, let alone my bed.

This is a big deal. For me anyways.


EDIT

I would personally love to thank each and everyone of you for your support. I feel so lucky to have support from everyone.

You have honestly restored my faith in humanity a bit.
