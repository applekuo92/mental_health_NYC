I know this sounds like a really stupid thing to be proud about, but I NEVER do my homework. I usually come home, sleep, and then feel terrible the next morning. I got home and rested and then actually got my ass up and did all my homework. I know this is a tiny feat but it gives me hope that slowly I can get better.

**EDIT**: thank you everyone for your encouragement and support. I can't even describe how much it means to me :)
