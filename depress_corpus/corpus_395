I titled it [The Taunt](http://i.imgur.com/opdDs00.png).

Hope and peace taunt those with depression.  They torture us by being so close yet always out of reach. And so you give up, and just sit there watching it from a distance, feeling mentally and physically incapable of obtaining it. You begin to deteriorate, staring at that flickering hope, and you watch everybody around you shake their heads and give up on you. This is what it feels like to be depressed, for me.

 I drew this when having one of those kinda days.
