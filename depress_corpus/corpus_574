Just fuck it. I should not be feeling so fucking shit about myself all the god damn time. 
I recently got a new job and all I can think about is worrying how terrible I am at it. It goes against all fucking logic, they wouldn't have bloody hired me if I was no bloody good. 

Fuck the warped logic. 

Fuck the paranoid feelings that my friends don't fucking care anymore because they clearly fucking do.

Fuck you for reducing me to the weakling I am right now rather than the fucking legend I once was.

Fuck you Depression and the Horse you rode in.
