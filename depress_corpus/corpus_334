I've been paying 50 bucks a month for daily bus rides to school, and today I decided it was enough. I have 5.7 km (3.6 miles) to school and I fucking did it. It took a little more than half an hour, and I did stop to throw up once, but I fucking managed to take the bike to school. And I'm sorry for cursing, but I'm just so damn pleased, and I wanted to share it somewhere.  

The sun is shining, I have a soda in my hand and I actually did something. I thought I was gonna burst into tears when I finally made it to school. 

I'm gonna go to math class and do absolutely nothing, now. And I'm also going to beat myself up over that. But at least I'll remember that I actually managed to go by bike for the first time in nearly a year. 

Thanks for reading, and sorry for taking up your time. 

EDIT: Thank you all very much for your nice comments and upvotes! They've elevated my spirits even higher than before. Also, thank you very much, who ever gave me gold for this. You all have inspired me to try and make this a habit. So thanks again, thank you thank you, thank you, for all your kindness. I'm very grateful I've been smiling more these two days than I've done for a very long time. This is feeling incredibly cheesy so I'm gonna end it here, but thanks again! ^ U ^
