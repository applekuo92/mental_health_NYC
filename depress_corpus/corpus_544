I wish all the time that I could go back be be myself from 5 years ago. Not necessarily to go back in time, but just go back to being me from the past. I was so much better at everything and I actually enjoyed things and was optimistic about the future. I used to be energetic and active, instead of lethargic and tired all the time. Now I consider it a good day if I actually believe my life won't one day end in suicide.
