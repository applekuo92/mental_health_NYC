I'm 19. I don't like birthdays. I'm so lonely. I have no friends. My sister said happy birthday. I went to my 2 summer classes, didn't talk to anyone, went home, watched a couple of episodes of The Office, sat in my bathroom, and cried.


I've never been in a relationship with a girl, and I'm a kissless virgin. This is because I have zero confidence and awfully low self-esteem. Nobody would ever be attracted to that kind of person. I hate myself so much. Getting older and marking down birthdays reminds me of how little I've accomplished in my life. I go to a community college, have no friends, and my social skills are almost unfixable. My mom died a year and a half ago because of liver cancer. I miss her. I cried a lot today.


Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. 



**EDIT**: I love all of you guys so much. Thanks again. All of your replies add up to more than all of my real-life/in-person birthday wishes over the past few years. Idk why I'm crying now. It's a weird kind of crying, like, happy crying. You guys are the best.
