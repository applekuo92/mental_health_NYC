I'm a youngish guy (late 30s) and just finished with the horrible experience that is a funeral.  My wife of 15 yrs passed three days ago, with no warning.  I am 4000 miles away from all of my blood family...though all of hers is local.  She was my whole life and purpose, and now I feel so lost.  I know these feelings will lessen with time, but I am hoping somebody out there has gone through this and can offer some good advice to help the numbness and pain.  

EDIT: Try for all the well wishes and all the very good advice.  I do intend to go back home in the UK in the spring for a week or two to see all my family.  
Those that asked what happened.  She passed in her sleep after taking her afternoon meds (she had lots of meds due to lots of illnesses) so at least is not longer in pain.  It is hard not to feel guilt over not seeing a problem sooner etc, but I also know that is foolish thinking.
