For anyone who needs their own, controlled, quiet place, there's a game on Steam. It's called Viridi. It's free and quite a small download. You create your own virtual gardening pot where you have to water and take care of your plants as you watch them grow. The music is soft and calming, the atmosphere is very much so the same. I highly suggest this download for anyone who needs to have their own little pot of calm, quiet, happiness.
