I have never seriously entertained the idea of killing myself, but sometimes when I think about the future, I get this overwhelming sense of dread and just wish I could disappear. Does anyone else very feel this way?


Edit: Wow, I am astounded by the amount of people that share this feeling. Im not sure about everyone else, but I find it kind of reassuring to know that I am not alone. I will try to reply to as many comments as I can, but if anyone just wants someone to talk with, feel free to message me! I wish you all the best of luck
