I joined this sub to gain a better understanding of depression and how to support people with it. I joined for my girlfriend. I mostly lurked. I read, gathered information and tips on how to help, and to know what is good to say and what to definitely avoid saying.

It's been 5 months without any symptoms for her. If it comes back, I'll be back, but I'm hoping I don't have to. This sub has given me great insight into something I can't truly understand.

Thank you. I hope you have the same success my girlfriend (now finac√©e) and I have had.
