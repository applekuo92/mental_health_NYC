Felt like sharing, since I'll probably forget those words by tomorrow morning. Also, I tried to overdose on vitamins, and now I feel ridiculous.

Thank you for listening.

EDIT: I really appreciate all the helpful words and support you guys have given me. I'm about to begin therapy which - I'll hope - will make me feel better about myself and allow me to build a life for myself. I made this thread to make sure I wouldn't forget these words, which she has spoken before, but I always end up forgetting and forgiving only to go through the exact same thing again.

You guys are amazing, and I hope things will work out for all of you as well, as I hope they will for me.
