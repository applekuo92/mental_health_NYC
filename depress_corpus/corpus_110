[Here is my painting.](http://erynkr.deviantart.com/art/Wulf-and-I-376838852)

I have schizophrenia, and my most persistent hallucination is of a large wolf. Gaming has always been a great escape for me. I couldn't sleep the other night, so I decided to paint this expression of that.

A friend of mine suffers from depression, and while our problems aren't the same, we do share the struggle.
