So I met a girl about a month and half ago and we hit it off really well. apparently I did something right because she doesn't like dating. She's never had a boyfriend and she pretty much turned down everyone who has asked in the past. But she said yes to being my girlfriend.

But the most amazing part is what she said the other day. I told her in full confidence that I'm worried about letting people close because my depression and anxiety hurt people before. I told her everything. My suicidal thoughts. My self harm. My depressive episodes. And she just looked at me and said, "Well I knew all that going in and I still said yes." 

That was one of the most beautiful things I've heard in a while. Gave me the first genuine smile I've had in over a year.

EDIT: WOW! Holy shit, I go away for a day and this blew up! Thank you all so much. I hope all of you find success as well. X)

EDIT 2: Okay! I think I've responded to everyone! I hope all is well with you my friends!
