I don't want to commit suicide. I'm afraid I'd fuck up, or it'd be really painful, or it would traumatize my family. But I don't want to live either. 

So sometimes I fantasize about being diagnosed with terminal cancer or something. Then I'd just lie in the hospital for a few months, go to Oregon, get assisted euthanasia, and die peacefully. Or, when I'm walking in the street, I imagine getting hit by a truck and dying instantly. Does anyone else ever feel this way?
