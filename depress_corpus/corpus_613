Title explains it all. My girlfriend and I had had a fight and broke up. 6 months later, I get a phone call from her parents. Apparently, she had become pregnant with my child, and when she found out after 6 months, at first thinking it was just her gaining weight, she shot the fetus, then herself in the head with a 9mm. Her suicide note read that she blamed me for the whole thing, and that even though she didn't want the baby, I deserved it even less than her, so she took it with her. At this point, I was at a loss for words, and it took me a good few days for it to finally hit me and I broke down. I only told my best friend who has been there for me for 5 and a half years, and he told me life goes on and all that. Cliche, but it made me feel better. 3 days later, I get a call from his parents saying he had crashed his car, and died from severe internal bleeding. I burried him 4 days later. At THIS point, I've been unable to drink or eat much. Not without it coming up again anyways... I've dropped 20 pounds from stress, and I can't sleep or smile. I'm not suicidal, but I don't know where to go with my life anymore. What does a person do after this sort of thing? I really need a hand here guys.

P.S. Don't ask me to try religion, because I already have.
