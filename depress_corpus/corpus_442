I will never tell anyone how I feel, it is not something I can see myself doing. My insecurities are growing higher then ever so that means everything I feel stays in. I know I'm starting to slip into that feeling again, the one we are all familiar with, only this time I feel like I am gonna be trapped in it for longer. Some of us weren't meant to live a good life, it's the way the universe balances itself out. I apologize for this kinda post, it defiantly isn't helping anyone, the negativity shouldn't spread like that but I felt I needed to let it out abit. I feel wierd posting this and I hope it just slips through the cracks because frankly I feel wierd even doing something like this, I cant post this  I should be getting some sleep I have early classes tommorow. 

Shout out to those who feel like everytime they try they end up in a worse place then before

shoutout to those who had their self confidence crushed over the years

shoutout to those who feel like crying for no reason right now

shoutout to everyone feeling depressed in any way shape or form, can't exlude anyone in this

can't wait to wake up tommorow and hate myself. Well thats enough ranting right now, this shit prob is confusing as fuck right now I hope it is somewhat legible. im nervous to post this. im not very smart so maybe this is just a bunch of unconnected sentances. take care ya'll,
