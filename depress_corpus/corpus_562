I've been considering it for years, and I'm excited to have it. Getting it was an adventure as well. It's on my right forearm.

A few people have asked me about it, and I explain to them, in short, that it's a symbol for suicide and depression survivors. The interesting thing is, no one has asked me about suicide.

One person said, "well, you're okay now?" To which I responded "I'm still here."


Edit: Here's a picture. (Stick and poke)

It's hard to get a good angle of one's forearm.
