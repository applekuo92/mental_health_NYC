I hate this ignorance so, so, so, so, so much. Told him I was suffering from some post surgery depression (not that I do suffer from dysthymia as well) and he goes on with this BS and some more. I IMMEDIATELY told him to calm that crap down. Not only do I know about this from a personal standpoint, but an educated one as well. Then he went on this completely irrelevant "I'm sober now" high horse rant about "taking action" and after giving him a thorough explanation of depression I promptly gave him an emphatic goodbye.

Sorry for the rant, but I HATE people like this who have not one single clue what they are talking about, but stick to their ignorant guns instead of taking a damn seat and learning something for once in their lives. And about something so important and central to a person's life as depression? Screw off, quickly.
