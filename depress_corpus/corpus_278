He PROPOSED.  As in, I'm nuts but just nuts enough that he wants to make a permanent, life-long go of it with me.  He has seen me on my deepest, darkest, bluest, in-the-ER-sobbing-for-any-type-of-relief days.  He's seen me at the bottom of a wine bottle for relief.  He's held me when I've been shaking and sobbing on the bathroom floor thinking I was about to either physically or emotionally die.  Or both.  

And he still wants this.  Holy shit, there's hope for us all.

Today, I am happy.  :)
