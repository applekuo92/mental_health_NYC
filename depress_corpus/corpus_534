They are happy and asleep, I joked around with them an hour ago and we were laughing and they were really happy. They love me. I love them.

Now I'm crying because they would be so sad if they knew how sad I am all the time. I'll never tell but I can't help to feel sorry for them, they deserve a happier child. 

Paradoxical.


EDIT: You're all amazing people with encouraging words. I don't think depression makes you a bad kid and I don't think I'm brave or amazing for hiding it from them, it's just that I want to try and cope on my own. I love those 2 people too much to make them worry about something they can't fully comprehend and wouldn't understand. But just because I'm scared of doing so with my parents doesn't mean it's a good thing. Sharing is amazing, you just have to choose when and where will you share, and to whom. I shared here and it feels great. Thank you for that.
