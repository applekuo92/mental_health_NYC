This week represents the worst week of my life. My fiance and partner for 10 years got into a motorcycle accident on Nov 13 and died the 20th, 3 years ago. 
After CPT Therapy to manage the PTSD symptoms, I actually felt grief and sadness over the loss of my partner for the first time in 3 years. It is gut wrenching and heart breaking. 
Today, I showered for the first time since the 13th. It took so much energy, but I feel a bit better bc of it. Just had to share with someone.
