My emotions have run me dry and I am now numb. I feel like this is the denial process of grief. I can't accept it. He was 63, and I lived with him for 5 years as his caretaker. All the other times he was ill or mistakenly taken too much of a particular medicine I saved him. Every time he fell, I picked him up. I fixed his medicine every week and cooked him a meal at least three times a week depending on my work schedule. My brother and I loved to watch wrestling with him. Every PPV, we ordered pizza and enjoyed the show. He was the biggest factor in my decision to join the Army because of his proud service in Vietnam. In fact I bought replacement medals for him that he lost over the years for Christmas. I wanted to see his face when I presented him his medals, especially his Bronze Star which he always mentioned first when asked about his medals. Now he will never see them.

I thought I was prepared for this. He certainly prepared, by prepaying his funeral expenses in 2012 without me knowing, setting a will in that year as well, telling me what to do when he passed, which I really hated because I just didn't want to talk death with my dad. But now here I am, along with my brother, faced with reality. It wasn't supposed to happen like this...I wasn't supposed to find you on the floor so stiff I couldn't perform CPR. I only wish I stayed up last night with you to make sure everything was okay, like I always did. I wanted you to see my brother graduating from college, our weddings, your grandchildren. My eyes are so raw from rubbing them today. My tears just aren't producing anymore. I want to cry, but I can't.

I miss you dad. Love you so much.
