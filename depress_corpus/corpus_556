To say the least, it's been an overwhelmingly nostalgic winter break for me back home. In the past week, I've learned that my sister is getting divorced (and has somehow gaslighted herself into believing it's her fault), my best-ish friend has gotten engaged, another is proposing, and I learned one of my cousins has transgender dysphoria and wants to begin living as a woman. I walk around my neighborhood at night reminiscing of all the times had. It is both nostalgic and melancholic, as I feel like I've hardly changed after four years of college and 2 and a half years out of school.Just been living out of state in a different city. I feel like Matthew McConaughey in 'Dazed and Confused' and I've even gotten that comparison before (the actor, not the character) which doesn't help matters. This Christmas, they were talking about who is going to be their best men, I hung out and drank with all of the 'kids' from just 10 years ago, am supposed to see another friend who I haven't seen in more than 3 years today. It truly feels as though the last of my childhood is going to die with the end of 2015, and I have a lingering dread that I've never done enough in my life and that I must accomplish everything I missed before I turn 30. Off to a good start by seeing 'Indiana Jones & THe Last Crusade' and the first 'Back to the Future' movie for what I can remember is the first time, and I feel inspired to write more non fiction stories about my adolescence from all of these new happenings, but still, there is always a lingering dread in the back of my mind that it is not enough. I have to evolve, keep becoming 'better'. In short, there's a lot on my mind this holiday.
