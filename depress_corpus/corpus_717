Wow everyone it's great this is getting so much attention and everyone's personal experiences of this type of treatment are very interesting. I think it's critically important that people learn depression is not a state of mind or a matter of just feeling a bit down. The word depression gets banded around and miss used too much. If Only we could snap out of it.
