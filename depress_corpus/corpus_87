So I used to be those people who, if you were depressed, would tell you that it's "all in your head" or -insert cliche suggestion/advice-. I wasn't mean about it. I just didn't believe in it.

Well, fast forward a few years, at 20 years old I got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. 7 months later, it spread all over my body, affecting my hands and feet the most. On top of that, I am also active duty. I played piano, I kick boxed, I hiked, I was active. And all of that was stripped away in the matter of months.

Because of that, and everything just kind of spiraled out of my control (I'm a bit of a control freak) I suddenly realized one day, there are very little things that make me happy. I feel empty. I tried everything to get back to my old cheery self. Then, I didn't want to try at all. The world got a a shade of gray, my steps were meaningless, food had no taste, everything I did was just to past time, no purpose. 

2 years later I was diagnosed as depressed. 
So to everyone out there with depression, no matter how severe or how it began, I am sorry. It sucks. Literally. It's like a dementor following you around 24/7. But please stay strong. I know you might not want to. I don't want to. But I hope there's light at the end of every tunnel. 

Edit: To all those saying "It IS in your head -insert science/chemical super smart explanation here- You know what I mean. I'm not speaking in literal terms involving your brain chemicals.
