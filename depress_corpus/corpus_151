As my depression has worsened over the past year, I've noticed a few things:

I can't read a book anymore, because I can't commit to sitting down and enjoying it; I've put off reading for so long that now it feels more like a nagging obligation than a pleasure.

I can't read online articles, or even longer Reddit comment threads anymore, my eyes start reading and just lose interest and trail off, barely even skimming the page.



I have to force myself to write Reddit comments with any substance.

I've stopped studying Chinese, even just the flashcards are too taxing for me.

I don't want to play any video games anymore.

I have an ever-growing list of new music on Spotify to listen to.

I have downloaded movies that I tell myself "I'll watch eventually."

I can't do even the most ridiculously simple shit on my long-standing, still intact to-do list, like filing away screenshots I've taken or reading Reddit comments I've saved "to read later." 

I just don't care about anything that requires even minimal thought or effort anymore.
