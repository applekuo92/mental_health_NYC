Obviously long story short, it's been a rough week and today started off just a little shitty but got exponentially worse by the hour.  It's left me with a deep feeling of not wanting to be around any more. Not in the sense that I want to kill myself but I just am fed up being me I guess? I feel like everyone in my lifes live's would either have no impact or be even better if I never existed..
I have a few close friends and family but I feel so incredibly alone.
