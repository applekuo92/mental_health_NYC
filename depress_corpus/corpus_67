* You run out of clothes to wear because you just can't make yourself do the laundry.

* You come home from work and just lay down on the couch because you have no energy to do anything. 
* If you're unemployed like me, same, but as soon as you wake up.

* You regularly go days without leaving your apartment. 
* You get a solid 8-9 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted.
