Does anyone else think this way? I've flirted with fantasies of suicide before but I've never thought of it as a realistic "way out"; the thought of what it would do to my friends and family, especially my younger brothers, if I killed myself means I doubt I will ever attempt.

However, I'm still gripped by the desire to just disappear, to escape from myself and from being a burden to people. I know it may be somewhat naive to think it, and I've slowly managed build trust about my problems with a couple of close friends and my parents but I can't help but think they'd be better off without me. I feel outright guilty sometimes for not being strong enough, for not being there for friends.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I'm at one of my really low moods and felt like writing something down.
