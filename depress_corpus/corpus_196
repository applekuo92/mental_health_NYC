I've been in a abusive relationship for to long! But today I ended it! She's been abusing me for so long and I finally grew the balls to tell her that I can't take it anymore.
 And you know what else I did? I CLEANED MY ROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2 YEARS. feels gooooood.
And I'm not going to spend this NYE alone! I'm going to spend it with my bestfriend. 
I'm happy! And I wish you all a happy new year. It will get better, but not by itself, you have to take control.
