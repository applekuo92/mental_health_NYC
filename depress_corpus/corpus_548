I dressed the store mannequin I use for dress making in one of my old sweaters and hugged it for an hour while I cried.

Edit: Thank you so much for all these lovely messages. I woke up to these replies and it's made me feel a bit less alone than I did. I really appreciate all of you taking the time to say something nice to a weird mannequin hugging stranger.
