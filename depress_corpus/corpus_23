It appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to "save" them after they've posted here.  Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click "report" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take "supportive" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

If you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  We all get more out of it that way.  

**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  In those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.  Don't forget that if you need help and don't feel safe posting, you're always welcome to message the moderators.
