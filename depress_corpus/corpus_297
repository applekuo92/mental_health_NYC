I'm not at the point of depression where I want to end my life but whenever I'm extra annoyed I have this mantra of saying those things even though I know I don't fully mean it. If I was annoyed in a non depressive state I'd replace those with something like "Aw man, I messed up' "Dammit, made a mistake". Not sure if this is some sort of tick that other people can relate to
