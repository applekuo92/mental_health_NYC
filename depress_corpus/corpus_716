A lot of us are alone. I don't know what kind of streaming service can show movies with a chat bar on the side but we should get one and have a movie night together.

EDIT: I'm really glad you guys like the idea! I've dug around a little but have exactly 0 experience in streaming... if somebody has a little more know-how to do it make a post and/or pm me! This could be cool!

DOUBLEEDIT: So I messaged the mods and they said that stickies are for subreddit business only, and recommended we make our own sub. Anybody have know-how in making subs who wants to jump in?

TRIPLEEDIT: /u/pixelnote has created /r/depressionmovies, which is where we're going to be doing this! Head on over and help us get all set up with ideas and tips; I think this is going to turn out really neat!
