I don't know what it is, but it's consistent. I'm constantly feeling like time is crawling and I'm not accomplishing anything. But every so often, I have a really fun night with some friends hanging out or playing video games, where everyone laughs and has a good time.

And immediately afterward, I want to die. I always feel like "This would be a good point to stop life. I just had a ton of fun. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and resume the daily struggle to do *anything*. I'll never really accomplish anything, so I might as well end on a high note."

This past Friday was the most recent time. Left a friend's house after a great night of hanging out, and couldn't stop thinking that everything might as well stop now. I even picked out what song I could listen to when I killed myself. Managed to force myself to go home. But I unconsciously took a longer route home that happened to pass by a very tall parking structure. I don't like that I did that. I don't like that my subconscious led me somewhere as if to say "You could always do it here, just like you keep imagining."
