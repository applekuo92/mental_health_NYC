I know part of it's because of the depression that's been poisoning my mind since I was a kid but anywho. 

My one friend, my mum and various counsellors over the years all know I'm 'depressed', but they don't know the half of it really. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't ever tell them what I'm really thinking day to day. Mainly that I pretty much constantly think about suicide, how lonely and desperate I am, plus a few other things I probably would rather not say on reddit. Even when I've been to counsellors I the past, I just have a total inability to be honest, even though I know that's the whole point of therapy.

Most of the time I just feel angry at them all, like they either wouldn't care, would care too much, would lock me up, or pity me. That they haven't earned the right to know what's really going on. 

Sorry if this seems pointless or if I seem self absorbed, sometimes I just have to vent to people who don't know who I am. Thanks.

Edit: Shit. I didn't expect to get more than 2/3 comments on this. Thanks for taking the time to share stuff, Ive read it all up until now. Love you guys
