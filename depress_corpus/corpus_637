I find myself just trying to find ways to distract my mind.  It's has been a combo of Netflix and video games.  I don't enjoy them like I used to.  I used to think "hey I wanna watch something."  Now I think "hey I need to distract my pessimistic ass mind by watching something."  Jw if anyone knows what I mean.
