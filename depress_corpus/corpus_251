Even though I woke up and knew it would be bad day. All the sweetest day things on social media and in stores today and I still got something done even though it's so small.

EDIT: God damn guys. I really expected a completely different response. You guys rock. Thanks for the support and understanding. I love you all no matter what you all may think of yourselves.
