I feel like because I'm a boy with depression I'm just expected to 'be happier'. It seems like girls and emo's are the only people that ever get diagnosed. I had to tell my parents that I was depressed and suicidal because there was no outside proof of it. Boys see boys with depression as weak, like they have a choice or that they are just grumpy and it really pisses me off. I never cried in front of anyone and always had to hide my depression in the fear of being a 'pussy'.this led to some really dark times where I was screaming at the top of my lungs and and crying uncontrollably and hitting things when I was alone because it was the only way I could get rid of my feelings without anyone else knowing. I feel like it is seen as a bigger deal for girls to have depression even though it can affect anyone.

Thoughts?

PS: I'm not saying it isn't a serious issue in girls, I'm just saying it is more difficult for boys to openly speak about it and seek help.
