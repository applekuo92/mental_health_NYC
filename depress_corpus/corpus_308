Seriously.  My 29th is coming up in a few days and people can't seem to take the hint that I don't want celebrate it.

My birthdays only serve to remind me that I've wasted yet another year in the same shitty job (been looking for a new one since January; no dice) and the same shitty living situation.  I've pretty much accomplished nothing but managing to keep existing and that in and of itself is pitiful.  Why do people assume I want to celebrate that?
