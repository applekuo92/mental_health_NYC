I have been committed to getting myself into better shape, so I take a walk on my lunch hour at work. Nothing too strenuous, but it's exercise at least.

Yesterday, the tears kept coming - I had to make multiple trips to the bathroom to avoid awkward conversations with my coworkers. And as I walked through the lobby of our building, it was so tempting to retreat to my car and hide for the next hour - crying and sleeping.

But I didn't do it. I walked out into a mild rainstorm and did my usual hike around the block, tears streaming down my face. I didn't let myself retreat further, and I didn't hide. Even though my pace was slower than usual, I still did it, and I had enough time to meditate for 10 minutes.

I'm still crying, I still hurt, but I am doing my best to make conscious decisions that are good and healthy for me in spite of all of that.
