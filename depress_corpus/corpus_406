Seeing all the lights, Christmas themed things, I just want to escape all of that but you can't. It's everywhere you go. The adverts on the TV hardly help (thank god I hardly watch television) and It seems to make my state worse.

What's saddening is that I'm getting anxious as Christmas approaches. I know I'm going to be sad on a day that many, many people will be happy on. Friends are getting into the spirit and I can't. It's a perpetual cycle that just further reinforces how sad and depressed I am.

Maybe it's just me. Christmas means different things for different people. For me, I'd just like to belong.

Edit: I did not expect such an overwhelming response, thank you.
