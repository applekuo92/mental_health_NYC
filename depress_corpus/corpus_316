Most people here have depression themselves. This isn't a therapy subreddit, the people posting here are just normal people looking for support. Realistically not every submission will be responded to. I think people who post here should be aware that not every post will get attention. Its an unfortunate reality of Reddit that not every post is visible and will get attention.

It might be helpful if the mods put something like this in the sidebar or something, since I see a lot of people angry that their threads didn't get a response.
