I haven't posted much, but I have read a lot of the posts on here. You all are terrific, and it was incredibly comforting to know others were in it with me. 

I am both sad and happy to say that I no longer need this sub. My life is going great, for the first time ever. I feel alive. Awake. 

I wish you all the best of luck. If I can come out the other side, you can too! Goodbye, my friends.
