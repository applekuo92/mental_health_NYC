Just like the title says, I worked up the energy to go get my hair cut and clean out all of the rotting food, bottles and school papers I was hiding from my parents out from under my bed. The haircut mad me look a little more human and cleaning the crap out from under my bed got rid of the horrible smell in my room and lifted a huge burden off of my mind. Just thought I'd share.
