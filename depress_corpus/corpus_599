It's Monday.

The start of another shitty week of loneliness, anxiety and sadness, or so I thought when I first woke this morning. But then I kind of had a strange change of heart, I thought *fuck it*.

I got up, fed my cats, took a dose of the 5-HTP bottle I've been neglecting, donned some shorts and a tshirt and went for a run, and wow. I feel great, It's nice to have had my body physically worked out and this has boosted my mood x100. So far my day has been very productive and happy, and you know what /r/Depression? 

**It feels fucking good**.

This post isn't to gloat or brag, I hope that if you are reading this, with the same thoughts as I had when I woke up today, I can inspire you to do something for **you**. Something as small as going for a 15 minute, 2km run has completely turned today around for me, and it's a pissy grey day in England =D

Go, get off on the right foot, kick this week's ass. 

Because you deserve it <3

EDIT - Wow, I really didn't think this post would get so much attention. Thank you so much everyone! It feels great to know I helped some of you guys out, this was the whole idea behind the post. Stay strong guys and remember -
