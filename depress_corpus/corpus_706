How I explain depression to people who have never experienced it

Depression is like being in the deep end of a really big pool, and the deeper you go, the more depressed you are. When you feel sad, you're underwater, but you're near the surface, so reality is only slightly distorted and you can still see plenty of light. But the deeper you go, the less light there is, the darker it gets, the greater the pressure. Deep enough and there is no light left, only darkness, and the pressure is so great that it feels like it's going to crush you. You feel like you're suffocating, like you're going to die. The root cause of your depression is like a weight tied to you that pulls you down. Fix the root cause, cut the cord, and you start to float out of your depression. Anti-depressants are like floaties that help pull you back up to the surface.
