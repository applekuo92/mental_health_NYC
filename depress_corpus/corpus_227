For my university's spring break I decided to go on a backpacking trip with 10 strangers through one of our adventure programs.

 I am so introverted. I am depressed most of the time, but I did it out of impulse. The first 3 days I hated it. People were so happy, all the time. People sang Disney songs every morning. I hated it so much. I isolated myself to my tent. I cried. I wanted to die. I thought about disappearing into the woods and never returning. 

On day four I became used to the unfamiliar environment and the unfamiliar people. I don't know what it was, maybe getting exercise and being outside nonstop every single day helped me, but I started to feel better. I was able to come out of my shell a little bit. My sense of humor started to show up, and people actually laughed at me. People listened to what I had to say. I felt valued for the first time in a long while.

As the week went on, I found myself unafraid to approach others and strike up conversations with other people in my group.  I really started to enjoy myself. The scenery was beautiful and each mile we hiked, I feel I learned a little more about myself and felt just a little bit better.

Towards the end of the trip, everyone decided on animals that represented each person in the group.  They determined I was a Giant Swallowtail (a type of butterfly) because I transformed so much in that week.

Now that the trip is over, I miss it so much. But, I just feel a little better overall. I came away with some confidence and new friends, and I just feel good about myself.  I am so glad I decided to sign up for that trip. I am really glad I pushed myself to do something I wasn't comfortable with at all.
