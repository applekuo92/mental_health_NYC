I just finished taking a shower. I'm wearing clean, comfy clothes and my socks feel heavenly on my feet. My face is clean so I'm not wearing makeup from yesterday. I put on deodorant and am about to brush my teeth and finish my hair. 

This is my hour of therapy. No talking to anyone else, no meds, just washing off yesterdays dirt. It feels fucking good!
