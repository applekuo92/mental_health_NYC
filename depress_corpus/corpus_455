"It's no problem at all. You are such a great person 99% of the time, that the 1% when you are down is easy to deal with because I know that the real you will be back very soon. *'If you can't deal with someone at their worst, then you don't deserve them at their best.'* -Quote from your favourite person."
For all of you feeling like it will never get better: I've been there.  But as you move forward, you will eventually find people who understand you and love you unconditionally. Even if there are only a few, those people (and animals!) are so very worth sticking around for.
