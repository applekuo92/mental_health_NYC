Some days I'm pretty okay. Well, not really okay. It's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on Netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. It keeps my mind off of things. It keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. It's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. And that in itself is a massive fucking success.
