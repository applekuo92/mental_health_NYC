Hey all. I'm 18 and it's currently about 2:30 AM and today (or yesterday i guess) was one of the best days of my life. I finally had my first kiss and it was just so magical. I never thought anybody would want to kiss me or be interested in me, but she was, and she truly is one of the few things that makes me happy. Amidst all the hardships and sadness in my life she is always by my side and cares about me so much. I'm glad it was her that got my first kiss. For now, even if only for a little while, I am finally truly happy.  
  
So yeah, just thought I'd share with all you wonderful people a new, special piece of my life.
