I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, and I just experienced the worst episode I've had in a while-- the spiraling thoughts of self-hatred, the difficulty breathing, the paralysis, etc. 

In the past when I've gotten to that place I typically cut myself to provide a temporary distraction and catharsis. Today, I was able to not do that. And I'm so relieved. I think I'm getting through this.
