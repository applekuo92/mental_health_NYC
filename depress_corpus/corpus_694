"It could always be worse" "At least you aren't a child in a third world country" "At least you aren't dying'.........

FUCK ALL OF YOU! You have NO idea what true depression feels like. You have NO idea what it is like to wake up every morning hoping to die in a freak accident because "committing suicide would be unfair to the people who *love* you." The people who love you only want you to live so they don't feel guilty when you fucking die. I'm pretty sure after 8 years of chronic depression I know whether things will fucking get better or not...

I know what physical pain feels like and I would take breaking my leg over depression any day of the week. 

Depression isn't merely sadness. It is a gnawing hatred for your self that attacks your mind every minute with the power of 1000 suns. Depression is lying in bed and taking a shower once a month because personal hygiene is reserved for those who love and respect themselves. 

If you EVER try to cheer up a depressed person by saying it "could be worse" then FUCK YOU!!!!!!
