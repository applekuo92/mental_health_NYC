You become more perceptive of the world.

More analytical, you just see things others don't.

You see the bad things, all the bad things. That one guy that said one innocent little statement? You saw more than that, you saw a passive-aggressive jab; so subtle, but it's there. No one else saw it, except you. Do you bring it up? They get defensive, all on-lookers see is you getting confrontational about something that "doesn't matter".

You look at political debates. You see how gracefully they inject buzzwords and specific stimuli in their sentences to arouse things in people. You see the very moment in people's eyes light up when that particular buzzword is said.

You realize how ungenuine everyone is. You cringe every time you hear someone ask "How are you?" You get angry at the nuances of cheesy radio commercials and consumerism.

You notice how everyone is on auto-pilot, keeping an ear out for conditioned stimuli with a predictable response.

You notice all these things, you try to express how things could be different. You get passively ignored, or worse ostracized

And god forbid you express any sort of genuine emotion. No no, we have to be "le funny meme ironic comedians". GOD FORBID!

I can't fucking take this anymore. I can't fucking belong to any community, or bond with 99% of people.

This is a god damn hell and I'm so fucking lonely. It's hard to be specific, its everywhere I go in life.
