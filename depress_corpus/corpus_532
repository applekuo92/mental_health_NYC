I never thought of that before. HE said I just need to switch my mind off anxiety and depression and stop worrying. Because I haven't spent the last 20+ years of my life doing everything I can to fight this. 

I explain my history of lifelong depression, anxiety, childhood trauma, meds, substance issues, suicide attempts, treatment detention orders etc. He said read "dont sweat the small stuff" (I have read it before by the way). And to just "enjoy life". Reminds me why I stopped seeing psychologists before.

UPDATE: so I spoke with my doctor again and told him my frustrations and inability to want to see my psych again. Long story short I have spent 3 hours talking to multiple people, finding another appt and explained the situation and how I was treated. They are taking it very seriously based on what I told them as above and suggested that they might stop referring patients to him as he works there independently. I dont want to ruin someones career but at the same time I dont want to sit back and be treated like that or let others be treated the same.
