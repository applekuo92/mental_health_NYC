The tough love ideologues are really getting out of control. I don't know where they are coming from. They are mostly idiots who are short on life experience and common sense, and long on hubris and a sense of entitlement. Many posts here lately receive comments that are just nasty in tone, and extremely judgmental, harsh and condescending in content. 

We really need the mods to crack down on this. I also request that you strongly emphasize that tough love has no place here. I understand that you say that on the sidebar. But I request that you say so in a more prominent place and in a more conspicuous manner. 

There are suicidal folks here whose lives may hang in the balance.

I strongly urge the mods to do something before somebody harms themselves after being publicly shamed in the name of tough love.

I think it's about time that we disempower the tough love acolytes and send them back to their Dr Phil reruns.
