i can't remember the last time i was happy, or what happiness feels like, and i have found myself just thinking of scenarios in my head, where my life is better, or just normal and then i smile or laugh to myself for a bit. But then i come back in to reality and become miserable again and realise i can't achieve this normal life that i make up inside my head.
