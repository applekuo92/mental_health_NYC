Ok, this is my first post on Reddit. I don't know how to start this or if anyone will care. But here goes nothing.

I've had depression for 5 years now. Each and every year getting progressively worse, it's tearing me up inside. It's gotten to a point where my heart aches every night and it hurts so much. Most of the time I feel like a burden towards others. I have nothing to offer and I have such a blank and boring personality. Everyone around me is so full of talent and have such colourful and interesting personalities.

I feel like a nobody. I feel like I don't exist. I regret being born. I feel ostracised, no one ever messages me or even bothers to reply, I feel like the third wheel of every group chat and I don't know why all these things happen. Why do bad things happen to good people? All I've ever done is help others and I'm rewarded with loneliness and an inferiority complex. Gee thanks.

I'd never kill myself. Ever. But a thought in the back of my mind always considers it an option.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I just want to feel like I exist again, I want to feel like I matter to someone, I need affection. There is just so much I've bottled up for so long that I desperately needed a release. I don't know if anyone will ever see or read this; but if you did...

Thank you.
