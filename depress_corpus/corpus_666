I was thinking this morning about how I don't feel like I think i'm supposed to in general... and it occurred to me that, when I think of how a person is supposed to feel you might rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, from "Sad to Happy".

But if I were to put how I feel in general on a scale of 1 to 10, that scale is from "Sad to Distracted".

Even when I'm not sad, I'm not happy, it's more like I'm just distracted from being sad by being busy or something.


I'm curious if anyone else feels the same way.
