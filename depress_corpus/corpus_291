My friends got two new kittens. They were so tiny and fragile. I spent many years not trusting myself with animals that small because I'd get violent intrusive thoughts. I knew I'd never act on those thoughts... I couldn't hurt a fly (seriously. If I catch a housefly, I toss it outside.) Still though, the thoughts would become so graphic and disturbing that I'd just avoid handling anything cute (babies, kittens, puppies, anything small and fragile). Plus, I had those thoughts constantly in general. 

I would rather not repeat the content of the thoughts here. All I'll say is that I began having suicidal thoughts and that's when I knew I needed help. 

Recently, I started Wellbutrin. My life's changed *completely*. My intrusive thoughts are pretty much gone. When they *do* crop up, they're so vague that they don't really make sense or have any effect. Plus I have some control over my thoughts now. When I start freaking out about stuff, I'm able to STOP that train of thought before it gets to, "It would be easier if I just killed myself." 

So back to those kittens yesterday: they were sooooooooo adorable. I was afraid at first to even touch them because they were so young. I picked one up and placed him on the bed. I put my face close to him just to see what he would do... and he walked up to me and started rubbing against my face! 

And in that moment, I was so utterly happy. Not only was I having a great time, but I also realized that I wasn't having violent thoughts about the kitten. I was *allowed* to enjoy this, and this was the first time I've allowed myself to enjoy something for so long... I felt tears well up in my eyes.

But I'm not one for crying. Not yet, anyway. So I quickly collected myself and resumed about my day... periodically revisiting those kittens because holy goodness they were so damn *CUTE*.
