I know, Im really late on having my first kiss. Today I finally kissed my crush, and it felt wonderful. For a moment, all of my problems were lifted off my shoulders and I felt like someone actually cared about me. I just thought I would share this with you guys, because for me right now in my life, its about all I have.

Edit: Wow everyone, thanks for all the kind responses, I never thought this post would really get any feedback, and it now has 556 up votes on the front page. I really appreciate everyones support, and I hope each and every one of you has a wonderful day. Stay strong! - Colourgreen3
