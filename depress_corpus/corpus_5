I was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, I wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far I've come. Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.

I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014.
