Since I've begun feeling like this I've shut myself away from everything I could. I didn't want to poison anyone else with these awful feelings and they all just assumed I was doing my own thing so these thoughts have been left unspoken until now. I don't even want help anymore I just want to die a death that I did not directly cause. Something like a car crash or an unfortunate construction accident, a freak flu that causes people to drop dead. I repeat just to emphasize, I don't want to kill myself, I just want to die.
