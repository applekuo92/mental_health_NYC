It's not the heat, but the crippling feeling of loneliness especially when everyone has friends but you. It's the feeling of drowning desperately wanting someone to save you, but in your isolation no one can hear your cries; not that anyone ever did, but there's a certain hope when you are surrounded by people that someone might. 

I hate summer.
