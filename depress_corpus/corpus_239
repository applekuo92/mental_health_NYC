The problems weren't temporary. The exact same problems haunt me today, though they may be in slightly different forms. I have a host of new, much more crushing problems to add to them. 

But mostly, things definitely have not gotten better. If I could go back and choose to die 20 years ago, I would. It was definitely not worth being alive. And things continue to decline. 

Fuck this shit, and fuck all the "helpful" people out there telling lies so they can live on in denial of the fact that life is shit for a lot of people and pretty much just gets worse as time goes by.
