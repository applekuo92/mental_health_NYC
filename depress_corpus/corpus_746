i called my university's crisis hotline (at the behest of my mother) after having a bit of a breakdown about the fact that i can't find a job and i'm out of money

the counselor on the phone told me, between now and when i meet with my therapist, to *try not to think about it*

after i hung up, i started laughing, it was the single funniest thing ever

i know they mean well, but try not to think about suicidal thoughts?  
as if it's that simple?

fucking hilarious

edit: my mom is willing to pay for food, since a lot of people seemed concerned about that, so i'm fine on that more immediate front
