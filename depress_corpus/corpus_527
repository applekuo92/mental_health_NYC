Today, I felt the shittiest I think i've felt in over a year.  I got home from work, did some of my homework, and then had no energy to do anything but lay in my bed.  

I don't exactly know what happened after that, but after about an hour of laying there, something happened.  Some uplifting song lyrics popped into my head (Music has always been a very positive thing in my life), and I was able to get up. I've never been able to turn my mood around like that, ever. And then something even weirder happened. I took a shower.  Normally this doesn't even happen on good days for me, so that's why it's such a big deal to me i guess. I don't think I had one before that for at least 4 or 5 days.  

I just felt compelled to share this for some reason. I hope someone can find at least some sort of comfort or meaning in it.
