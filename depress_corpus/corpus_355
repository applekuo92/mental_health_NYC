My 17 year old son chose to end his own life three months ago. In his note he said, "I love you, Mom. I'll always love you, even after my heart stops beating."  I'm not religious. I beg you not to talk to me about God or heaven or a "better place". Today, I can't stop crying. I miss him so damn much it's overwhelming. I'm pushing away thought after thought of my own suicide for the sake of my other two sons. Please lie to me. Tell me some how some way his energy or the spark that was him  exists and does still love me. And maybe more importantly, that he can still feel the unconditional love I had /gave to him in life...

EDIT: I want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time and effort to share yourselves with me. There is so much pain in life but you've also shown me how much love and grace exists, too.
