I was driving home from work thinking about stuff and I started getting all blah feeling. And it an hour long drive so i definitely had time to think and brood and whatever.
Anyway something clicked in my head and I said to myself Lannaaax3, cheer the fuck up and do something nice for yourself. So i stopped and scheduled an appointment for my first tattoo and i got my hair done all special and it made me feel really good. 
Now my hair is half pink and im scheduled for a pretty awesome tattoo and for a little while i felt good.
Gives me some hope :)
