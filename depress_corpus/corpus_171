I hold myself to impossible standards. I have no idea why; nobody in my life put the expectations on me that I've put on myself. This is coupled with a fierce fear of failure. I've realized that the result of this is me constantly holding myself back. I keep myself socially secluded, and never really put myself out there for anything, because when I do, and inevitably dont meet my own irrational standards, I turn into a useless void of self-pity. I make up excuses for why I don't do anything. I'm starting to think I'm just lazy. Or scared. Idk.
