Why was i so inhibited? I didn't smoke, drink, fight, fuck, party.
I was not rebellious in the slightest. Not risk-taking.
What does that make me? A boring robot? 
I am lonely. And i feel so damn INADEQUATE. 




I wish i was risk-taking and extroverted.
I wish i had done more things. 
I don't have many embarrassing memories or stupid mistakes. I just have a big fat fucking regret of not having life experiences
I didn't chose this personality. I have always been easily scared, obedient, and calm.




Boring is the worst insult. I will never be fun to be around.
Mostly it has caused me loneliness in my life. Especially when it comes to romance. 
I can't really impress anyone. I'm not exciting, i don't do spontaneous things (but i'm lately became self aware, trying to force spontaneity) 
Neither is my depression dramatic and violent. It's not like in pop culture. 
It's slow, silent and pathetic. Worst of all is the feeling of inadequacy. 
The frustration and self hate that brings tears to my eyes. 
Self hate takes up alot of my time and focus.
