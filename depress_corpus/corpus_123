Just kissed the girl of which I thought was waaaay out of my league. I've really missed the feeling of happiness. FUCK YOU DEPRESSION

EDIT 1: Ok im going to present my story which isnt very special. I know her from a friends birthdayparty where we had a long talk about life and stuff. She was beautiful and I really liked her from the very beginning. As I mentioned I was 100% sure that she was way out of my league and I didnt even bother trying to flirt. I didnt want to go to (god bless I did) because I had a really shitty day. While being at the party I took some time of because I had a little down and she joined me and we began to chat. After the party me and a friend wanted to hang out and I didnt know that she was there as well. Soon my friend had to left and we were alone so we just talked casually. Afterwards I told her that I really enjoyed being with her and she answered with " I truly did as well" so I typed: " When will be the next time?" While writing that I kinda shitted myself because im such a coward. I sure to be denied but she said: "Why not tomorrow?" I was like wauw wtf and said "Sure!". Next day we decided to watch the naked gun and really enjoyed the movie. As she was about to leave I just grabbed all what was left of my pride and just went for it. Turned out that she is a very good kisser and I'm going to meet her again next week. If i wouldve not gone for it i wouldve hated myself as i do always when i back off while tryin to approach a girl. Thanks for all the comments and upvotes did not expect this big of an audience at all. Sorry for the bad english :D
