I some times look happy. I'll smile and laugh and even joke. But it's fake; it's my mask that I put on to hide the fact that I'm no longer that "super happy, super sweet" girl any more. I don't want to let any one know that I was weak enough to let depression crash over me and ruin my life.

I've realised that my general personality is no longer "Always happy, but some times a tiny sad". It's now "Always sad, but some times a tiny bit happy".


No one knows, though. They don't know that as soon as I turn away from their watchful faces, my mask slips and the broken, fragile person shows through. 


I'm sick of feeling hurt, and empty, and lonely. 


And I'm sick of hiding it, and holding it all inside where its just festering away at me.
