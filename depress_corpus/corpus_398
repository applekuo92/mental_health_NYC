I can't function normally anymore. I don't want to eat, I don't want to sleep, I don't want to study. I want to stay at home all the times as a sort of an escapism. I watch porn just to stop thinking about her. And when I think about her, I just hurt myself more. I think about her beautiful pale skin, her dark hair, her melodious voice. I think about the possibility of someone touching her right now and it physically hurts.
I'm a really emotional person and I feel like my crushes really cross the level of a normal person's crush. I actually start to love them after a certain amount of time.
But I know I have no chance with her. I have no chance with any of them. I'm an ugly weirdo no one will ever love. So, there's to that.
