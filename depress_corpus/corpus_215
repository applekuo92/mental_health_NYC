Today, I successfully convinced my parents to let me see a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and am now taking antidepressants. 

I fucking did it. No matter how incessant that voice in my head telling me to go kill myself was, no matter how excited I felt as I picked up that kitchen knife, no matter how angry and shameful my parents were at me and no matter how great the hatred I had for myself...

...I successfully managed to embrace and endure it all. I chose the path that keeps me alive.

I know it's not over yet. The feeling is still there, of wanting to give everything up and end it all.

But fuck that shit. This is now my turnabout, and I'm far from going down.
