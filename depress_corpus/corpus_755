Fellow redditors in /r/depression I know this is a hard time to feel this way. I understand your pain and I understand your desire to be left alone until everything ends. I understand that all of your environment is joyful and happy and you don't feel like it. I am like you.

Even though I'm not having the best time of my life I know that this is just a temporary thing and that someday this will pass and that I will be able to look back and realize that I'm in a better place.

Meanwhile I just want to send you an internet hug and wish you a normal day if that is what you wish today.
