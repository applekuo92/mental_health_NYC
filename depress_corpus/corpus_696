#Wall Of Text Warning 

I posted a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/471h1h/ive_started_clearing_out_my_social_media_in/. 
 You all really came through and I really appreciate every message and reply you all took the time out of your day to compose and send me. You are all so amazing. I really wasn't expecting much.

On the day that I posted,  I did go through with scrubbing most of my social media clean. I thought that maybe smoking some weed and enjoying the nice weather outside would help. So i tried that, but the whole walk I just cried and did not feel any kind of better, and had to go back home to put my makeup on again because it washed away. So then I went to a ramp near the highway, ready to jump into traffic. But I just stood there. I stood there looking into traffic for about 20 minutes, and then decided to check my messages. They were so personal and thoughtful. I decided that I was going to give life another shot the next day, and if it didn't work out, then I guess that was it.

The next day, I decided I was going to do something different. Got up 2 and half hours earlier than usual,  treated myself to a nail appointment, then, instead of taking a cab to work, I took a bus I had never taken before. Just a random bus, to see different people and places. And it was so surreal to go through parts of a city I've lived in my whole life that I've never really seen. I didn't even know habidasheries were still a thing, but I [saw one]( http://i.imgur.com/42L38l6.jpg) . I also took a break from social media, just to be with myself and my thoughts. 

These last couple days have been improvements, and I feel like I'll be okay for awhile. I have a fun day planned for myself and it'll be nice out. I just wanted to let you all know that I'm okay and you all are a part of that happening. 

So TL; DR: I'm okay, I feel okay, and I thank you all for reaching out to me, even though I didn't respond to many, and I apologize for that and any worry I caused :)
