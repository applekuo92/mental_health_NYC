Every single night, I go on Facebook. I go through a list of friends I've made that appear in custom lists, and I check to see if these friends are awake past 1 am. It's my list of depressed people, and if any of them are awake, I message them, and make sure they get to bed okay. Then, I go on Yik Yak, and look for any depressed Yakkers. I comfort them, and get them to bed safely too. Only then can I ever rest. 


I've been depressed and alone too many times. I will never let it happen to anyone ever again.
