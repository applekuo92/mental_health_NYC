Like the reason people don't want you around them isn't because you did something wrong, or because they're assholes, but because everything about you as a person is just disgusting?And no matter what you do, you can't figure out how to fix it, or how to make it better?  Because i have.

It seems no matter what i do, it'll be never get better. Because the problem isn't other people, the problem isn't even mental illness. The problem is me. The problem is that i can't empathize with most people. The problem is that i'm a self centered asshole who wants everyone to be nice to me 100% of the time. Because i don't give a fuck about other people's feelings. I wish i could, but everytime i try it just feels fake to me. What am i doing wrong? 

Please help.
