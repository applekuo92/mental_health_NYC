It invalidates the suffering that person is going through, makes them feel selfish for not being a starving child of the subcontinent, and, frankly, it's lazy.

My favourite personal experience with this one was when the cancer I got wasn't as bad as my brother's cancer (really) so my family could-be-worse'd me and I was essentially disallowed from being upset. 

My mum has apologsed after, how random, some grief training she had as a volunteer at the hospital.

All suffering is valid. Goddammit.

ETA - You guys are all so lovely. I might have a cry. The good cry.
