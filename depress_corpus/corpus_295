I'm in the process of deleting my Facebook because on top of depression I have a social anxiety that extends even to the internet. When people on FB do not respond to my posts I feel like no one gives a shit and it feels personal.

When I see how happy other people are with families, friends, etc. I feel more like shit since my life is pretty much shit and I will never have kids, most of my family doesn't even speak to me, and I have 1 friend that I talk to on a regular basis and she is on the other side of the country. 

I even get nervous posting here on Reddit.

I am in therapy and I realize the roots of my social anxiety, but that doesn't make it stop. That on top of the depression is just too much.

Anyone else feel this?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who answered in this thread. You helped me a lot more than you probably realize.
