I'm taking my medication and I'm fairly stable right now but I still low-key want to die. I never act on it, but when I go to do something simple and common-place like cross the street, I always wish that I'd get hit by a bus. The fact that I'd be ruining some poor driver's life doesn't bother me. I just lowkey want to be put out of my misery.

I had to use a knife this morning to cut my pizza, and I thought about cutting my wrists. Not in an abstract way, but a logical one. I thought about how cutting vertically on the vein will make it harder to repair and make it bleed more. I even put the knife against my skin for just a minute to feel it's sharpness.

I'm stable. I'd never go through with it. But I'm still planning my suicide like it still matters. Does anyone else do this?
