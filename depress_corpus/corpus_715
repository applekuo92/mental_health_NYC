I have 3 dollars left in my bank account and rent is due soon. No presents for anyone. It's hard to watch your sister be showered in gifts while you're struggling. I want to cry so bad but I can't. My room mate is trying to drag me out with her since she sees I'm in a funky mood, but I declined. I'm not trying to add seeing my ex to my list of a why this is a wonderful shitmas. I hate being poor. I hate being forced to live on my own at 20 years old. I just literally hate my life and as much as I wholeheartedly try to better it, some greater force shits on my attempts and laughs at me while I try to clean the shit up. I hate Christmas. I hate everything.
