I like rain.

I like rain becuase it makes me feel normal, it makes everything, normal. 

To others, rain is the worst thing that can happen that day, to me, it's the best.

When the sun comes out every morning when i wake up, i want to close the curtains, make the sky dissapear,make the sun burn out, extinguish it. 

That won't happen.

What will happen is, i will wake up, a feel the weight pressing down on my chest, and with the same heavy chest, get ready for another day of torment, another day of grey.

The same day for everyone else, is to wake up, feel the sun on their skin, the warmth of it, and feel uplifted, happy, with the same routine as mine, but their day, is filled with colors, vibrant, amazing colors.

You tell me i'm the one at wrong here, that everyone else sees color, and i don't, something is CLEARLY wrong with me. Right?

If you ask for help, you are a coward, weak. Whatever.

Take these pills, they will make everything better. It's the opposite. It makes everyone around you feel better, because they don't think you are a problem anymore. But the pills doesnt change our feeling, they simply numb them for a while, only for the effect to stop working, and you put on an act for everyone.

Let me rephrase how to wake up. You wake up, feel a wave of sadness wash over you, you get dressed, and you go down to eat breakfast, after that, you go get dressed again.

You put on a smile for everyone else, you put on a smile because you don't want to be the problem anymore.

I like rain.
