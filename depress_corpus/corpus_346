I told myself that I was going to be okay with a small win today. So I have three things on my list.

1. Get out of bed (which I have done).
2. Clean up my apartment (which I am in the process of doing).
3. Eat something and keep it down (which ... I'm going to work on).

I just... wanted to post this somewhere. And I'm not ready for my entire Facebook to know that I'm dealing with stuff... and I'm sick of bugging my friends about this. I just wanted someone to know that today... I got out of bed. 

Edit: Thanks so much for all the support!! It's been a really rough week, but you guys have really helped me finish it out. I wish each and every one of you the best... Thanks so much y'all!!
