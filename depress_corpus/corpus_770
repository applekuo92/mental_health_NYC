It hurts for indescribable reasons. I don't remember the last time someone touched me with any sort of care or intent. It makes me feel vulnerable in a bad way. Most days, I sit with a blanket wrapped tightly around my shoulders to try to avoid the feeling. It never really works anymore. A type of unease crawls underneath my skin everyday, always reminding me of what I don't have.

I fantasize an unhealthy amount. If I focus hard enough I can almost feel someones hand rubbing between my shoulder-blades, or running through my hair. Its as close as I can get. I try to convince myself that it could be worse since I don't actually know what the real thing feels like. I don't really know how true that is.

Its touch-starvation, if such a thing really exists. Everyone lists food, water, oxygen, and shelter as the basic human necessities. I think we should add touch to the list. Not having it has left me feeling so fundamentally unbalanced, distressed, and distraught I can't help but wonder what will happen to me if it continues. Its become something I feel like I *need*.

Fuck me. I've had to fight for myself for as long as I can remember, can *something* be easy for once? I just really need a break. I'm not sure how much longer my willpower can hold me up.
