My brother and I are both 15 years old, and we do EVERYTHING together. Or at least did, and I absolutely loved him. 

4 years ago, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and he went through 6 rounds of chemotherapy, countless weeks in the hospital, and multiple surgeries in attempt to rid the tumor. For the first 2 years, Never in the world did he sleep for more than about three hours without waking up for at least ten minutes, for fear that he would lose himself. 

But of course, things had to get so much worse. After about week 116, my brother couldn't talk anymore. He had to adapt and learn sign language so he could communicate with my family and the doctors there. He was still fine for a little while longer. 

About four weeks ago, James's (my brother) tumor disappeared. Miraculously our prayers had been answered. Then one day he came home from his tutoring saying he felt weird. We went to the doctor, and the doctor said his tumor returned, and was given 5 days to live. But being the person he is, he made sure he stayed around for as long as possible. 

My brother isn't like anything else, he was the only thing that could inspire me to do anything, and now that he's gone, I feel no use for anything anymore. I need some help, please redditors. 

Thanks
