I didn't know how to phrase the title to make it shorter, but I am realizing this right now as I'm in the middle of a crisis. I'm depressed, suicidal, but also pretty anxious (especially socially anxious) and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety. Because I don't live alone, I feel like I wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged. The attention I would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if I think about it now. Just thinking about it makes me panic, and by trying to avoid the anxiety, I try not to think about my death. 

While the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time (yay, apathy and anhedonia!), which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack. 

So I guess that's a good thing, isn't it?   


Edit: Oh wow, you guys. I was not expecting all of this at all. I wrote this kind of in the middle of a really bad mental breakdown, while trying to give myself reasons to get out of bed the next morning. I'm sorry it took me so long to come back to this post. But thank you so much for the replies. I have read all of them, and will reply. I hope all of you have a great, great day. Let's keep our heads high! :)
