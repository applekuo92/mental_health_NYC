When I'm asleep, I forget who I am.  Those first few seconds of bliss when I wake up, look at my girlfriend, and smile.

Then I look around me and realize it's just another day of this.  I remember why I'm depressed.  I remember the crawl.  I wake up, go on my computer all day, and smoke weed all day.

I can't remember the past two months.
