i wonder whether my current state of mind is because i'm doing so inconceivably poorly in school. i finish school next year, i constantly wish something would happen so i don't have to live til graduation in spring of 2014. i wish i could disappear, or never have existed, or something, anything, so i don't have to confess this to my parents. i feel so horribly about the annual $57,000 tuition they pay, only to have me squander away my days in college feeling hopeless and utterly unproductive. i've dropped more than eight classes, i have a D on my transcript...i don't want a future anymore. i dont want to find a fucking internship, i don't want to go to grad school, i don't want to confront the reality that i've fucked up so badly that there's no chance i'll find gainful employment in the near future.

how many of you feel depressed due to academic failures? 
is it still depression if you feel the solution to all your problems would be a clean slate from first year?
