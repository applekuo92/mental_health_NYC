I feel like absolute shit today. I thought I was heading in the right direction but recently I've got much worse. Feeling like you're sliding back into severe depression is pretty fucking crap. I rarely get out of the house, partly because my sleep pattern is so bizarre. In the past I've found going for a wander in the evening can be helpful. I'll be going out anyway but if anyone wants to join me you're welcome to, whoever you are. 

Probably not going to get a response, but hey it's worth a shot. *(UK by the way, not Cardiff in the US/Canada/Australia)*

Edit: I have returned. No one joined me this time but it was good to get out. Cheers for the messages and replies, I love this subreddit sometimes. If you happen to stumble upon this post in the future, feel free to PM me as this is probably gonna be a regular occurrence.

Edit: Also it's 4am, so I'm going to sleep/attempt to sleep :)

Edit: Waking up to all these comments was great. **Lots of people have suggested turning this into something** - i.e. choosing a time in GMT and doing this regularly, regardless of where you are. People have also suggested having a group chat or using Skype. **Please PM me your thoughts** because I'd love for this to happen and I'm crap at organising things :)
