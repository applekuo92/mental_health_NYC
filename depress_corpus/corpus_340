Second year university student here. Just found out i've totally bombed the semester thanks to hardly being able to make it through each day rather than concentrating on university. After speaking to a lovely lecturer I figure the worst case scenario will be that I have to retake the year. I'm just so angry that after already taking 6 years of my life so far this will be another wasted one all thanks to this horrible illness. and I don't know what to say to parents as they have super high expectations and invalidate my mental health issues. hahah fuck my life, I don't want to be here.
