I just wanted to say something positive, since I've been so lonely and depressed lately.... I made friends last night! How you might say? Well, I love the sport of hockey, and live here in LA I expected not to meet any hockey fans..

 still getting use to living here after graduating from college in New England....  UVM Grad! 

so I made a group on Meet Up group if anyone was interested in coming over to my apartment for booze/food and the game between LA and Anaheim.  Low and behold 6 people responded and actually showed up! (5 dudes, 1 girl ) 

 I was so anxious, and I felt so incredibly awkward at first, but then I let down my guard :D they are a great group of people like me, and I feel blessed to have made friends with them :) GO KINGS GO!
