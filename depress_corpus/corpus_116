I want you guys to know that I made myself breakfast...or dinner, or whatever. The point is I got up and made myself food. Two eggs, two pieces of sausage, and a piece of bread. I tore up the bread into pieces so that I could (once the eggs were done), break the yolk over the bread you know? And then cut up the sausage with my fork and mix it all together.

It was fucking delicious.

Now I have a tall glass of orange juice that is tasty as fuck too. 

I'm proud of myself. Considering how depressed and up and down I've been...I went in the fucking kitchen, washed a pan, washed a cup, a bowl, a fork, and a spatula. I feel like a fucking champion for doing that. 

Fuck yeah.

Anyway, carry on.
