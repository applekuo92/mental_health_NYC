So I have been seriously depressed for ten years. Every day has been a struggle. My career has sputtered to a halt, I've nearly ended my marriage, it has been awful. I've relentlessly beaten myself up for things that happened more than 15 years ago. I can't overstate the daily terribleness I have suffered through. No drugs or counseling have helped. 

A week ago I got into bed feeling awful as usual. I rolled onto my back and for some reason put both hands palm down in the centre of my chest, one below the other. 

Unbelievably, the mental pressure faded. The knot in my gut that has been my constant companion unwound. I was shocked. There was a warm, flow-y sensation that was hard to describe. I didn't move, just basked in it, fell asleep feeling like I was five again and mommy was reading me a book. 

I have been sleeping this way for a week now. Everything has changed. I am functioning again. My wife has noticed the difference. I never thought I would feel happy again, and now I can honestly say that I have, and am. I haven't changed anything but my sleep posture, but my motivation is back. Positive feedback loop here I come. 

So reddit, WTF is this? I have no idea why this worked for me, but I highly recommend you try it if you're depressed. Can't hurt right?
