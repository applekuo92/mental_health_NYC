We are not just "sad" or being pathetic.  our disease is no different than any other body/chemical disease (like cancer, MS, Lupus, etc).  Asking us to "Suck it up and stop being pathetic" is the same as asking a paralyzed person to "suck it up and get out of that wheelchair and stop feeling sorry for your self".

For me, I don't think the non-depressed population has a clue what we go through every hour of the day.  Many days it takes all my strength just to elevate myself up to a level of "really sad".
