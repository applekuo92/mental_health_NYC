Like those days where you feel more functional and you do normal stuff, you get out of the house and just generally act like a healthy person would. It makes me feel like a fraud, like I'm not really depressed and it's just an excuse for being lazy. I shouldn't be wasting a doctor's or a therapist's time, there are people in far more need than me etc etc. And then a day later I feel awful again and I realise 'hey, this isn't normal, I do actually have a problem'. And then I repeat the cycle over and over again. So tiring.
