My attention span is shockingly short, I forget things all the time, and my thoughts are all over the place. 

The worst thing has to be the memory problems. I forget shit all the time. What chores I'm supposed to do around the house, and whether or not I took my meds this morning. 

I also have a lot of trouble focusing. I can't get anything meaninguful done because my brain is so scrambled. Even driving has proven dangerous a few times. Sometimes I doubt whether or not I should be out on the road. I can hardly read a book for enjoyment because my mind is so disorganized.

People close to me think that I'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but I'm actually trying my best. But they won't hear any of it. They always see "if you wanted to, you would" and while I guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that I forget shit all the time.

On top of all this, the lack of energy makes me not want to do the things I *do* remember, so it's like an obstacle course of things I have to get through before anything gets done. I have to actually be awake and not sleep all day. Then I have to remember what to do. Then I have to have the energy to do it. Then I have to have the focus and overall mental competence to do it properly.

I feel like I have the mind of an eighty year old at age twenty, minus the wisdom and experience.
