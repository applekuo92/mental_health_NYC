I went out for one of my grad events and after standing around awkwardly after the thing was over, someone asked me if I was coming along with them. I ended up going with them and ended up having coffee while sitting around 9 other people, listening more to the chatter than trying to join the conversation since I never knew what to say, but it feels awesome to be included and I wish I got these chances more. 

edit: Thank you everyone for the nice comments :)
