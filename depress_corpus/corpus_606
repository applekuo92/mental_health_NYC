I'm 33, and have been dealing with this beast since about 17.    
&nbsp;


I managed, got through school, went to a university and graduated with a bachelors in Economics, from a UC school (university of California).  Have had a few relationships, decent number of friends, etc.   
&nbsp;



Currently I'm working at a warehouse making a pittance and living with my elderly parents.  For the past years (many) I've seen my peers become successful, establish families, get married; all the typical shit I guess you would expect with someone when they reach 30+.  
&nbsp;




I feel that I have a high degree of intelligence (i could be wrong), shit, maybe I have aspergers or autism or some shit.  Anyways...It's like I know where I want to be and I know the necessary steps to take in order to get to where I want to be but I'm incapable of following that path?  
&nbsp;




What I really want to know (and hope to open up a discussion about) is the people that are in their late 20's, early 30's, and beyond that are still coping with depression.  What medications have you tried, what is your plan?   
&nbsp;






(more background)...most of the time I feel completely apathetic.  Most nights, since as long as I can remember, I've wished that I wouldn't wake up the next day.  I  have a very bleak view of humanity and the direction that we're going in.  More recently I've debated with myself the purpose of life.  Ultimately the purpose of a species is to procreate, procreate, adapt, procreate.... If I have no desire to have children then what is the point of my existence?  The point is to find happiness and fulfillment and blah blah and I get that...but let's say your brain is miss-wired (depressed) the majority of the time and there's only fleeting moments of happiness then what is the rationality in continuing on?
&nbsp;




I'm obviously a cynic, but reasonably so I feel.  Anyways, I want to change, I want to be happy and have some purpose in my life.  I want to hear from the older crowd about what they're doing /have done to make life more purposeful.  
&nbsp;



Sorry for the rant, I'm just getting at the end of the rope and am beginning to contemplate the end; my precariously unleveled existence...
