[Finally got my GED](http://i.imgur.com/FxOJ0cp.jpg)

I dropped out of school when I was 17 and have been lost doing dead end jobs since then. I'm 25 now and have been trying to finish my GED for years but would constantly give up or just figured I'd never get it anyway. But finally. I got it. I told my depression to fuck off. That I was going to do this. And I did.

Just believe in yourself guys. This might be a small nothing to most. But to me this is the proudest thing I have ever done.
