I spend all day on Reddit so I don't have to think about things that stress me out. The stupid thing is that there are things that I want to do, yet I always put them off until tomorrow. I've wanted to start a webcomic for quite a while now. I have a tablet and can download Photoshop for free from my university, yet I haven't drawn a single panel. If I can't even get myself to do something for fun, how the hell am I going to survive life?

I'm on winter break right now, but it ends in 6 days. Before winter break, I promised myself that I'd apply for the study abroad program that I need for graduation, but I haven't started that either. I'm so nervous about asking for recommendations, since I haven't had any professors for more than a term, due to switching majors twice. I know I need to just do it, but the more I put it off, the more anxious I get.

**EDIT:** Wow, this post got so much more attention than I was expecting. I'm really glad to know that I'm not the only one struggling with this. That being said, I think it's time for me to really make an effort to disconnect myself from Reddit. To help me in this process, I'm going to be deleting this account, so I'll have less of an attachment here. I've read every one of your posts here. Thank you for sharing your experiences and opinions, and I wish you all the best in overcoming your struggles.
