I just moved into college a few days ago. I've made a few friends, but I keep making plans to go out. 

These plans cause me huge anxiety and stress. Going out spontaneously is fine, but planning stuff makes me extremely stressed out, and I've already cancelled on somebody despite only having been here for five days.

Do you have any advice?
