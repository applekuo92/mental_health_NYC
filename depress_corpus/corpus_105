Alternatively, I wish someone else could jump in and take the driver's seat of my body, and I could just passively watch from behind my eyes.  Hell, passively going through the motions of living is what I already do, but it's just so exhausting.  I don't have the energy or drive or wherewithal to make living into anything more than a chore, but apparently other people do.
