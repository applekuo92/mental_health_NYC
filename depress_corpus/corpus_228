I've been doodling sad comics recently which have helped me feel better. [I made this tonight.](http://imgur.com/gallery/JRdPqyg?lr=1455685837) I'd like to make a bigger one someday when I'm better at making flowcharts so let me know what I could add.

Edit: I'm still bad at making them but I'm going to post the sad comics weekly on [my blog](http://www.inbreak.ca/stckmen/)
