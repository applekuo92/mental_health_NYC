Yup, you read right. I frequent hookers a lot, and yesterday I got so lonely I couldn't get an erection.  I just told her straight up that I just want to talk. Surprisingly, she was happy and thanked me for not having sex. I had some time left and we talked. I mean she was a drug addict, but I asked what her situation was, and we got to talking. It was great, we talked for about about a half hour and she was so friendly, I even got her phone number. It was nice to actually make a friend.

It was embarrassing that I couldn't get hard, but I don't regret it because it was nice to get to know someone in the flesh. Yea, online friends are great, but it's just text in the end.

I'm such a joke, I'm 28 and never had a girlfriend.
