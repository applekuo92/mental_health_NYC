It's one thing to be a troubled adolescent (which I was), then those tricky 20s... now I'm in my 40s watching people my age (or even decades younger) achieving such incredible things and making real lives for themselves - it is gut wrenching.  I feel two inches tall.  I'm envious, but feel helpless to do much more than stay sober, physically healthy, mentally stable, and have a simple life.   Once things get complicated I lose my shit, can't cope, get depressed, etc.  So I just sort of stay comfortable but stuck.
