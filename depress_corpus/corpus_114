Sure I may have felt a little guilty or bad about putting so many hours into MMO's and other games from ages 10-19, but the wonders it did for passing time and making me feel good in life was the sole thing that got me through some very dark times. 

Now I WISH I could escape all day into a different world, I didn't know how good things were until it was gone.
