It's the only reason I haven't killed myself.

Suicide is *hard*.

There's a reason everyone, including me, wants to die but doesn't actually want to kill themselves. If suicide were as easy as pushing a button, I wouldn't be making this post right now.

But you have to get the materials, you have to make a plan. Even more difficult, you actually have to *do* it. And of course, you don't want to fuck it up, because things get even worse if you do.

Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. I just want to be dead.
