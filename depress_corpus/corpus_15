It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, "who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

Edit: I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down. Recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart. 

*"The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life."*

I know it's far fetched but it applies for me today.
