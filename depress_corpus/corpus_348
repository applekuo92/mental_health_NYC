I have been struggling with PTSD and depression since I was little. In December I was let go from a dream job due to a reduction in the work force. Since then my depression has gotten worse as I feel no self worth due to no job. I have no health insurance due to a snafu with social security (long, horrific story) and no access to my anti depressants and anxiety medication.

I found myself masturbating with my knock off hitatchi wand several times a day to lift my mood for a few minutes and to help fall asleep. Sadly, my wand died last night and I have no replacement. It was only after it died that I realized how dependent I was on the orgasms to help combat depression and sleep issues. Does anyone else use orgasms to help with depression?
