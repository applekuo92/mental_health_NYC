I feel very unmasculine for posting this, but it's the truth. I just want to hold someone else, be a rock for them. They can help me when I'm down and when they're feeling down I can care for them. They can come and hold me on the days I don't have the strength to get out of bed. I hope one day someone will sweep me away. 

Ech, I feel weird for posting this. Curse my angsty, naive 19 year old brain. 

EDIT: Wow. Thank you guys. I'd hug every last one of you if I could.
