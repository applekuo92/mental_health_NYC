I always feel like that after a while of thinking about my life. I feel it's physically hurting me inside, literally.

Lately I've been even doubting this reality in some way. Like, I look at my hands and move them around, then feel like this isn't real (it's really hard to explain, pardon me). I've also been hearing things and I feel like I'm becoming insaneâ€¦ :/
