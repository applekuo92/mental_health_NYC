I feel like after years of being depressed I've become worse at everything I try to do, I used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me. When I'm studying I'l forget everything and even when I'm focused on reading I almost feel like I'm just staring at a blank page. 

No matter what I do I can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more I feel like I'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting.
