Like the real laugh, from the heart... and its usually about something stupid but it feel so good and you stop and think of how long its been since that happened, and how you cant imagine that people are laughing and feeling like this all the time? 

When I get where I'm going I'm going to laugh and smile like that every day, and its going to be amazing.
