It's almost as though some part of me wants to stay alive just to see if it ever really does get better.


I really hope it does.


Edit: I really didn't expect this many responses. I've been having a really hard time lately and just kinda wanted to get this off my chest. 
You're all amazing and strong people, and I really hope that if it hasn't gotten better for you already, that it will soon. 
Stay strong friends.

Edit 2: apparently I like the word "really" a lot.
