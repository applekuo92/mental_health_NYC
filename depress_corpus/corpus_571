I begrudgingly told my boyfriend that I felt like I just didn't want to be alive anymore. His immediate reaction was to yell at me and tell me that he'll get me the cyanide pills.  The then proceed to call me stupid for thinking like that. It only made me feel worse. It's the first time that I actually opened up to someone and it blew up in my face

**edit: thanks everyone. I appreciate what everyone is saying. I'm trying to respond too but I'm on mobile. I really do appreciate all the insight your giving, I apparently forgot about how emotions play so big a role in both sides. Thanks for everything
**talked to him again and he said he will always say that when someone says they want to kill themself. That he would always offer the gun. I told him I can't be with someone like that, that he's pushing me further down by saying things like that, even before I had a plan. He just stared at me.
