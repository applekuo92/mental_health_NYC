I want to cuddle with someone who I love, and who loves me. I want to feel safe and protected from the world for at least once in my life. I want to forget, even if just for a little while. I want to let someone in. I want to finally let it all out. I want to feel something other than nothing. I want intimacy.

I'm tired.
