I am more than a little frustrated because I am seeing a lack of support for those hurting here. I see some people making a genuine effort to comment and let people know that they care. However, I also see people's posts being ignored, overlooked, and even downvoted! Why would you downvote someone who is sharing something intimate with you, knowing their struggles!? It is cruel and it is better to do nothing at all! 

I came here and spent two hours the other day writing something that came from the most intimate part of my life and was greeted with one response that was later deleted and 0 upvotes. I know things can be missed. I know I wrote a lot. Honestly I am more concerned for people who have no one to talk to. This sub has 100,000+ subs. It is not hard to click a little arrow to show someone that you read their story and relate to them. We should be able to do better than this!

Edit: To those saying "I am too depressed to respond." I am sorry I did not include you in the post. I have been there and that is a really bad feeling. You are not alone.
