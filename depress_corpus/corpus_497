whenever I meet someone, I have to initiate contact, otherwise they loose interest. Even in my childhood, I was rarely invited to parties or events. My friends enjoyed my company when I was with them, but they never call. This is not for the lack of trying either. I threw a get together for my highschool friends. They seemed interested and excited. But nobody came. I now feel that their friendship was fake, forced as to not make me feel bad. I tried giving them space too, see if they might call to check up. I have not talked with a friend for over a year.
Even my family seems to recoil at my presence. My siblings never ask how I'm doing, they only contact me when they need something. My parents seem to care, but only about my success. Who cares if I am fully and truly lonely as long as I have a degree and a respectable job that they can put on their fucking wall. Bottom line is, nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody has, and I don't see this changing in the future. Every bone in my body aches every second for a genuine relationship. Can anyone relate to this?

(Sorry for the rant, I am in a rough spot right now and nobody gives a fuck)
