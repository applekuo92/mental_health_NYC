It's hard admitting that I've thought of jumping off this bridge before, and I've walked out there a few times, but always turn around and walk home.  Today I was walking over the bridge to get to a bank downtown, and noticed something faded was written there.  Looked it up on Google Maps when I got home.  I wish it wasn't as faded, and that I'd been able to see it the times I walked out there.
