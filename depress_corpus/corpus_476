You want to talk to someone but you're brain won't let you. 

You finally manage to talk to someone but then they get upset and you feel shitty again for making them upset. Like "no don't be sad, it's not that I want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist."

You need to eat but you haven't eaten so you're brain can't think of what to eat so you don't eat.

You haven't showered in three days but you've been in bed until 5pm so you might as well just wait till tomorrow. You're not going to shower tomorrow. Fuck all this noise. 

You go on social media. Everyone's a cunt. You feel bad again. 

I feel shitty again for wasting you're time with this rant. Sorry. 


EDIT: Thank you r/depression for providing a place to post all this stuff. Also, to anyone who takes the time to comment. Thank You! It means a lot when there isn't anyone close by to talk to.
