This is not view baiting or asking for advice about reddit, I just have a strong "the other reindeer" feeling I need to vent. I don't understand how some threads get thousands of upvotes, while Im lucky to have one person reading mine. I suppose it's exactly like real life anyway, what am I even hoping to expect. 

Still alive, trying not to die, not to 'finish the job' tonight
