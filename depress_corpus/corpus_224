Warning: I will sound like an entitled child, but I'm dead serious about this.

I'm currently a student and recently I've quit my part time office job. The job should've been great, decent hourly pay, major-related, alright coworkers, etc. but it's only made me feel suicidal. 

You wake up way too early just to prepare to go to work, you waste more of your life with the commute, you slave away for 8+ hours, commute back, do 'chores' and you get to have 2 hours of rest. Yay! Obviously those 2 hours are filled with dread of waking up tomorrow again, but you know, relax for those 120 minutes. Enjoy "life"!

Now this job was 2 days a week. Simply imagining doing this for 5 fucking days a week for decades is making me suicidal. There's no work-life balance. Maybe 2 hours a day of actual free time. Work is your life. If you have family, you'll see your coworkers more than your family. You're a slave. Fuck this.

I will graduate in like 2 years. University is alright. Don't get me wrong, I still stuffer from depression, but it's okay. I have my own schedule. I can take breaks or take a day off for my mental health. I'm surviving without suicidal thoughts. 

Maybe I'll add a PhD if my mom won't be dead by then, because she's the only reason I'm currently doubting my plans. Otherwise, that will have been it. 


Again, I know how it sounds. "Welcome to the real world" ; "That's being an adult". I'm fully aware there's no way around to still survive, so the only logical way out is suicide. Fuck the real world. Fuck being an adult. I will have had my 23ish years of being free, I'll thank my family a lot for making it at least bearable for that time.


P.S.: Those who do have jobs, how are you still alive? What's wrong with you? How is not everyone doing this BS suicidal?
