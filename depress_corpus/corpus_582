Upper respiratory infection out of nowhere.  Went in for the what he thought was pneumonia and died shortly thereafter.

I never had a dad, he was the closest I've ever come.  I had a breakthrough a couple weeks ago with him, realized where most of my feelings of guilt came from.  The tears that rained down that day felt so cleansing.

Almost a year with him.  He gave me one hell of a discount to my financial situation and lack of insurance.  It made me feel bad that I was getting him for so cheap.  

One of the kindest men I've ever known.

During our last session we talked about how much we both admired Eminem's "I don't give a fuck" attitude.  He was a pretty hip guy for a 63 year old.  

He encouraged me to follow my passions, to not let all the internal nay saying and fear get the better of me, to cultivate a rebelliousness within me.  I hope I can do him proud.  

Feeling a little adrift right now, not sure what to do next.  More therapy?  Mourning period?  Remember every session with him and right down every scrap of wisdom I can remember before it washes away?  Yeah, definitely that last thing if nothing else.  

Starting to cry again.  The thing I need right now is...a hug.  Even if it's just an internet hug I'd appreciate it a lot.  

Thanks for listening.  

**EDIT:**  It's funny how even internet hugs can help.  Thanks guys!

**EDIT2:** I hopped on reddit for the first time today to find tons of positive advice, great stories, and hugs.  Thank you all!!!
