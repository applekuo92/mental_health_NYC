You can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. But please, please don't ignore me. I want my existence to be acknowledged. I want to be sure that I'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing I'm there, like I'm an outsider looking in. Please don't make me feel any more isolated than I already do, like I have no friends who genuinely care about me. I know I suck, and I know I fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. I deserve it. But whatever you do, I'm begging you, *please* don't act like I'm not there at all.
