I have good friends.  I have a great family.  Not a single one of them has noticed I am suffering from depression.  I don't know if I've just become particularly adept at hiding it, but I feel that I show classic symptoms of it (sleep a lot, keep to myself, etc.) and at this point all it would take is for someone to say "hey... I noticed you're sad all the time.  Is there anything I can do to help?"   Not that they could really "help", but that acknowledgement alone would mean so much to me.  

The not noticing just makes me seem so invisible.
