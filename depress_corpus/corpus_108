Like if you can get the card game from Witcher 3 as a standalone app (you can't, it took me 3 hours of searching to work that out). Yet tomorrow, i'll want to try and motivate myself to do just an hour's seo work, or a short jog and some hand weights, and my motivation just deflates at the thought of all that effort.

It's one of the stupidest traps, that you can't do shit if it is at all important, and yet if it isn't important, you don't want to 'waste' your time on it. And you end up doing fuck all anyway. 

E: To clarify: It's not simply procrastination. It's a weird glitch in my motivation where my brain anticipates an activity that will probably only take 10 minutes to an hour, but write it off due to feeling I won't have enough energy/time to do it successfully, so it'd be a waste of time. But instead of doing something productive instead, i'll then *actually* waste the time that it would have taken me to do the thing (by just checking my phone or whatever). 

And yet I do not encounter the same motivational 'lock' when picking up my phone to type a reddit post, or experiment with settlement layouts in fallout 4. Inconsequential activities that are *actually* wasting my time seem to slip past the 'waste of time' demotivator, at least until i've spent way too long on them and then feel bad. 

I don't know if i'm explaining this right, it's just a weird logic glitch i've been thinking about. You know, instead of working :(
