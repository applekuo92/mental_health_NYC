Basically, I was diagnosed with depression when I was 10 years old. I'm 25 now, and it has been an uphill battle the whole time. There's a LOT I could go into about what has dragged me down, but one of the big things was my room.

I had a LOT of help from a good friend, and I could not have done it without him, but just taking that first step to even start cleaning was huge for me. And I know cleaning it is actually the easy part; it's keeping it this way that's going to be hell.

But just having it clean like this is already such a relief, I am hoping that the idea of clean environment = happier me will motivate me to tidy up a bit every day. Once I get that down, I can move on to other aspects of my life that need attending!
