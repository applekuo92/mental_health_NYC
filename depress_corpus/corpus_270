I was grocery shopping the other day and basically out of nowhere (although I wasn't having a good day either) I just started crying. I stopped immediately and just had to fight back the tears till I was done. I got back to my car and just cried for a few minutes.

I usually do errands or go places to distract myself from everything, but that's not working anymore. I felt so pathetic.

Does anyone else deal with the same thing?
