Does anyone else dread being asked that question?

I work in a job where I meet with outside vendors fairly often. Usually, they take me and a few coworkers out to lunch. We talk about some work related things, but the conversation inevitably drifts to personal life topics. Mr. Salesrepguy will ask us what our hobbies are outside work.

 My coworkers will go "Oh, I do a lot of hunting, and I go dirtbiking every other weekend" or "I compete in iron man competitions and train for 3 hours a day" or "I play in a local softball league and a few of my buddies are in a band."

Me? "Uh... just... y'know. Hang out. And... er... stuff." Because I have no hobbies. Or friends. My time outside of work is spent pretty much exclusively sitting around and surfing reddit, watching TV, and thinking about how much I hate myself and how nice it would be to kill myself.  

Other questions I hate:

"So, are you married?" No. I'm the only one of my coworkers who isn't, except for the one guy who has a new girlfriend every month. I'm 24 and have never been in a relationship, mainly because I can't imagine anyone wanting to date me.

"So, any big plans for the weekend?" Yeah. Wake up around 9, but be unable to build up the motivation to actually get out of bed until at least noon. After which point, I'll sit on the couch instead, reading reddit and watching TV to distract myself from how much I hate myself. I'll think about cleaning the pile of dishes that's been sitting in my sink for at least a week, but I won't actually do it. Oh, and I won't shower either, and may not even put on clothes.
