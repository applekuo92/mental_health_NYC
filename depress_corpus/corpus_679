So a few weeks ago, I told a friend about my depression, we talked about it for a few hours, she was extremely surprised, and had a lot of questions. She said I could call her at whatever time I wanted, even if it was 03:00, just to talk to her about it. I just avoid the topic because I always feel like I'm bothering her, ahe asked me this week how I was dealing with it. I told her it wasn't going well, and she again said I could call her whenever I like. Every time I get my phone to call her, I convince myself otherwise, because I think I'll just be annoying her and dragging her down with me. Does anyone else avoid talking to people in these situations?
