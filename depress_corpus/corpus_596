Two days ago my roommate made the decision to shoot himself in the head while I was the only one in the apartment. I was in my room at the time and was startled by two noises that sounded a lot like somebody dropping something on the ground. I didn't pay much attention because it didn't seem that loud, more or less like somebody fiddling around in the bathroom. It wasn't until 6 hours later my other roommate and I found him. He had missed the first time he shot and the leveled the gun and shot again. I had not put the two together until later that night and then the next morning it was revealed that's what he did. I was no more than 20 feet away from him when he did it, and all I can think about is those noises and seeing him. 

What honestly scares me about this is that I've had bouts of depression/anxiety for a lot of my life and used to attend counseling for it. The detective on scene told me that once somebody has seen something like this that they are 5x more likely to do it in the future. I wouldn't consider myself suicidal but I just feel really weird like there is this mundane lump in the front of my brain and my body has been tensing up. I can only relate it to when you're near a ledge and you feel your body getting ready to just jump off it but your brain is telling you it's not a good idea. Will these feelings pass?
