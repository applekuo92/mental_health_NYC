If there's one thing that depression has taught me, it's the fact that if you recognize the problems in your life you have the power to fix them. No matter how hopeless you feel on the inside your actions can still have positive outcomes and you can better yourself.

I'm not saying I'm at all out of the woods yet, but I at least feel like I'm progressing for the first time in about 3 years. Also today's the one month anniversary of me quitting cigarettes, cheers.
