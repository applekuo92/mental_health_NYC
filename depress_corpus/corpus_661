Like the title says. My girlfriend cheated on me. Three of my family members were killed in a car crash, and a person who decided to help me with a career died of an aneurysm. I struggled with depression and self-harm earlier in my life. And I just need someone to tell me it's alright. 

Edit: to everyone who replied. Thank you. Your messages and support have been amazing. I'm going to therapy this coming monday and I thank you all for helping get on the path to help myself.
