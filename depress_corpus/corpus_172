I got depressed about 2 years ago anI slowly drifted away from my friends. At the moment I only have one person I occasionaly talk to. The bad thing is that she is going to university in England next year (I live in the Netherlands). I will have nobody left and I recently started thinking of commiting suicide everyday.

But last week I had the idea to buy a pet to care for so I will have a small reason to live. And I absolutely love my new hamster.

I just wanted to tell how I feel right now and maybe getting a pet will help some of you guys. I got a hamster because they are pretty cheap and really easy to take care for, because I know it's hard to take care of something if you already have problems with taking care of yourself.

So that's all, I hope all of you have a great day today.
