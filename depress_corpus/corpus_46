So there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. I'd always apologize even if I was wrong. I refused to apologize and it all fucked up. She knew I had depression when we were in relationship. I told her I feel depressed and she said "There's no such thing as depression"

Anyway, she found out from out our common friend that I visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. So at the end of the chat,I told her I'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said "I don't give a fuck even if you die"

I stopped texting her after that. I was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, I fucking won't. Fuck you.. I'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.

EDIT: Just came home and saw your replies. I'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. In the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if I can help one person, I'd be the happiest person in this world.
