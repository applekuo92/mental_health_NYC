119 days ago I had to stop drinking. I would blackout every time I'd drink due to the excessive amounts I would have. I would wake up most mornings with a terrible hangover and cuts on my arms. I would later find out that my housemate caught me sniffing my medication mixed with pain killers. 

But today was the first time since I was a teenager that I cut myself whilst being sober. I watched the blood come out and be washed down the drain in the shower. My depression is genetic apparently as there are no known triggers. I am in my last year of my chemical engineering degree, I have an incredible family and friends and I see my psychiatrist and psychologist regularly, but for some unknown reason, I hate myself and feel so empty and alone. I wanted to share my afternoon with someone, without telling my friends, someone who knows how I'm feeling.
