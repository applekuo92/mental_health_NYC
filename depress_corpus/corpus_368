I have had a pretty fucking awful semester of college, and I am just so excited. I took the chance cause I was like what could go wrong? And now I am going on a coffee date at 2. I don't know what to expect and that excites me. 

She seems like a really interesting girl too. 

I haven't felt nervous for anything in the past four months, but now I'm super nervous. It's such a weird feeling. 

Who knows what's going to happen?!
