I have watched this sub for a while now. I have spoken about this before. People are going unnoticed here. They are pouring out their hearts and no one is listening.

If you are like me, there are a lot of people on here that have it worse and I can't give advice to them. I feel clueless when I read their posts. 

**But I still read it.** I still heard their problem, whether it be a cry for help or rage filled vent.

I am sure a lot of people come on here, read posts, and can't think of any way to help or relate so they move on. However, no one can see that you did that unless you **give an upvote.** On this sub, I see upvotes as a way of saying, "No, your not alone. I am listening."

So please /r/depression, please try to let our fellow users know you give a shit. Nothing hurts more than going to a place that is supposed to be supportive, and then being ignored.

Just a few minutes to read, then a click of a button.

That's all folks.
