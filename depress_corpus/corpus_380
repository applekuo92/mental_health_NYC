But I have casual thoughts of suicide all the fucking time. They almost never mean anything, probably like 1 in 500,000 or something crazy like that will be me actually thinking about offing myself, but I'll be walking to class on any given day and I'll just think "oh hey I should kill myself" or I'll think about what it would look like.

I don't remember when that started being normal.

I don't like this being normal. I should have a strong reaction to it. I'd never tolerate another person telling me to kill myself or that they were going to kill me, and I definitely wouldn't think it was okay if someone handed me a painting of my body crumpled up in the shower with the top half of my head missing.

Why is it okay when I do it to myself? Why am I not repulsed by this shit?
