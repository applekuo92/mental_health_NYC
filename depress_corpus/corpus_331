Call me a bitch and all, but who the fuck intentionally downvotes a post by someone who is struggling and/or just venting? The only probable cause I could see in doing that is if the person is attacking somebody else or saying hateful things. But my god, some of you are like a cancer on some of these folks who honestly have nowhere else to turn or have nobody in life. And it's really sad to see that a majority of these posts aren't 100% upvoted when I could think of no reason as to why they deserve a downvote. But I guess there's always gotta be that asshole, right? 

Sorry for ranting, just gets on my nerves when I see broken people on here possibly getting more shredded by the thought of somebody downvoting their post. :(
