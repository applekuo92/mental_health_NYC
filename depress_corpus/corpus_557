Like how do people know your problems are temporary? That one day you'll get better you just have to make an effort to improve yourself. I hate hearing this. There's no guarantee things get better. And staying alive for another 50+ years only having a maybe one day things won't suck anymore isn't really enough to motivate me to keep living. The only things that's stopped me from killing myself is I simply don't have an effective method to do it. Because I sure have tried. A lot.
