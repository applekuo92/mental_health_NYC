I might be getting a job soon that goes from 8-4:30, Mon-Fri. All I can think about is how I will be spending a huge chunk of my day doing work for someone else. I'll have a few hours in the evening, but then it's early to bed so I can be up again by 6:30.

How do people do this and be okay with it? I honestly can't find the point to even living when 8.5 hours of every day is spent doing something I hate. You get the weekends, but they pass by so quickly and even then you usually have shit to do so you don't get to relax. 

Not sure why pretty much everyone doesn't feel the same way.
