I got out of bed at 6:30 AM this morning and made myself a healthy breakfast, drank some coffee, and took my vitamins. 

You're not going to trick me into skipping class to lie in bed all day, depression.

I'm also going to work out after class, and then tack on an extra 5K run for good measure. Endorphins are your kryptonite. And tomorrow I will not lie in bed all day, no matter how sore I am from working out. 

*Today's going to be good, and I'm not going to let depression fuck it up for me.*

**Edit: Yay - reddit gold! Thank you to whoever sent me that!!**

**Edit 2: I had no idea this would inspire people so much! Glad to see that I'm managing to bring some hope and smiles to the people of r/depression. :)**
