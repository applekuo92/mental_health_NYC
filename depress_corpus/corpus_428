Just wanted to share with someone since this is an important anniversary for me.

Apparently out of the hundreds of suicidal patients he's seen, I was only the third he thought would actually be dead soon. Since then I've had several more suicide attempts and 5 more hospital admissions, but I am still here. I sort of thought today would feel more significant than it does. I still struggle. I still have suicidal thoughts. I'm stable, though, and I've ruled out suicide as an option. It's harder that way, but I owe it to my family and friends to stay here, and the world is too interesting to leave it so soon.

I'm glad I'm still here.
