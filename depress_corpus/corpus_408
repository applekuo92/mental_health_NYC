I was wondering if anyone here has been accused of using depression as an excuse - I've been informed that I have a bad habit of either blaming my poor communication choices on depression or if I blame my poor communication choices on my depression and use it as a justification in my head...

This has got me stumped to be honest and my head is spinning. My friend in question has no filter and generally says what she is thinking and can be a hard person. 

This was in response to me expressing my feelings (which are pretty irrational at the moment) which made her feel bad.

Anyone?
