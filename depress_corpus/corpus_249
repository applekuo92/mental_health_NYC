My off-and-on depression has been building up gradually over the past couple months, the fog rolling in thicker and thicker-- and today I woke up feeling like it hit its peak. It took all the energy I had just to get out of bed and go to work. I ended up being over 2 hours late. I had to cancel plans with a friend who I've already canceled/flaked on several times this month because I just did NOT have the energy. He said he understands, but the feelings of guilt/shame about canceling were so intense. 

My addict mind was telling me all day that I was gonna pick up a bottle of whiskey on the way home. It's funny how your brain can convince you that alcohol (or your vice of choice) is the ONLY thing that can make your pain, guilt, shame, self-loathing etc go away. But in reality, drinking myself to oblivion would make my situation WORSE. I would've woken up hungover and ashamed and still depressed as fuck tomorrow, and probably canceled again on my friend. Now I'll hopefully get a normal nights rest and wake up feeling semi-OK.

But here's some good things that happened today, I want to acknowledge them too. I went to an amazing doughnut shop and since they were about to close he sold me a whole box for $3. I passed the ones I didn't eat on to the homeless. And, feeling REALLY good about my choice to NOT get drunk tonight, feeling strong because I resisted such a strong urge, I was motivated to apply for health insurance, finally! Today was not a total loss for me. But it would've been if I had gotten drunk. I would've fed the voice of depression that tells me I'm worthless.

I really just wanted somewhere to share. I hope we all continue to get better.
