In this one year I moved 3 times, including in with my parents, was "funemployed", had 39 out of 40 job applications rejected, moved across the country, went to meetups religiously and befriended everyone I could, tried (and miserably failed at) online dating, medicated, therapized, exercised, got into a car accident, meditated, dated myself, and sometimes cried so hard that I had bruises under my eyes. 


I'm not even close to where I want to be, but fuck it, I'm going to give it another year.


My brain is broken; I recognize that. It will take a long time until the chemical imbalances are fixed and the destructive neural pathways wither away into ghostly remnants, but in the meantime I'm going to try my hardest to be the best person I can while continuing everything else I've been doing...except for the crying... =) 

edit: You all are amazing! Thanks for the support and the gold (and also my most upvoted post)!! I wanted to point out that setting a goal that might not be met isn't something I would advocate for most people, but in the moment it was a way to keep myself going.
