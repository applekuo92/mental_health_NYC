Past 3 years have been a clusterfuck of depression and other associated bullshit. Not any longer. 

Today: I will go to work and I will do 2 hours overtime
Sunday: I will visit my nan and I will smile
Monday: I will pass my media coursework
Tuesday: I will go on a date
Wednesday: I will volunteer at the local radio station
Thursday: I will work the soundboard for eyes like knives
Friday: I will sort out my university placement

Fuck you depression!
