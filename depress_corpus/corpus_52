Hello everyone. As the title says, a year ago on June 20th I hit my lowest point. I had close calls before, but this one was worse. I was going to throw myself in front of a train. After that incident I decided to get my act together. I started seeing a therapist and being more open with my friends about myself. In addition, I started to draw again. 

Some of the stuff in this album I have submitted to here or r/Anxiety, and it's been pretty well received. This is the first time I'm submitting almost everything I've done up til now, so I hope you guys like it and this helps you cope. Please tell me if this is harmful and I will take it down immediately.

EDIT: I am making this edit pretty late--it's March 11th as I write this. If anyone is still looking at this or happens to stumble on this post, I have decided to make a website to host my artwork. I cannot thank you all enough for your support. http://www.aninternalsoliloquy.com/
