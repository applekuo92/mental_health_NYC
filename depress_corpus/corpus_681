That was my gpa for this semester. I failed all my classes with 3 D's and an F. I've cried every night because I am such a screw up. I haven't even told my parents because I am so dissapointed in myself. I failed the exact same classes last semester too.

Why can't I get my shit together? Why can't I stop procrastinating? Why do I always whine on the internet and can't just do these things?

I've wasted about 25k on a year of education. I've ruined my 4 year graduation plan. I am such a fuck up. Why can't I just be happy and friends. Why am I such a royal fuckup with everything I do. 

Every night I wish I could turn back time and fix all this. I'm 21 and wasted my entire life. I've got no hope and no future. I have such low self-esteem and confidence that I just want to go far away.
