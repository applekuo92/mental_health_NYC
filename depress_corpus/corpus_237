Almost cried in front of all my co-workers. It was the first time in a very long time that I actually felt worthy or even remotely good enough. It felt amazing to know that at least one person on the planet appreciates the effort I put in.

For most of my life I've always been the black sheep of my family. My whole family is ashamed of me to the point where I moved out to a tiny room in a nearby college campus where I struggle to pay the $500/mthly rent. I'm absolutely alone 99% of the time. I had one friend that I could count on to hang out with at least twice a month but he found himself a girlfriend and a new circle of friend so he's long gone. 

All I do is stay in my room and read about technology which is my only passion. I experiment with different gadgets and stuff on a daily basis just to keep me sane. My dream is to start a tech company but every time I look in the mirror I realize how far fetched that goal really is.

Anyway, enough with my ranting. Just wanted to share with you guys that I felt happy for the first time in a very long time. It was a great feeling even though it only lasted a few minutes. It also gave me hope that things might get better in the future and that one day I will be able to fall in love and just be happy.
