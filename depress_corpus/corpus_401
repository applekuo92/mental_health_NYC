Whenever depression gets worse for me, I often find myself remembering some time in my childhood in which I said or did something dumb or cringe-worthy. Followed by a wave of self-loathing. Not too much time passes before it happens again. Wash, rinse, and repeat.

I know it's irrational, irrelevant, and ridiculous to judge myself as if it had happened now. But it happens anyway, and it gets in the way of me just being myself as a 20 year old in college. Does this happen to anyone else?
