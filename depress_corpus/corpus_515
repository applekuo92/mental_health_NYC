Please share your experiences with what has helped you manage your depression, in any form. Whether acute or day to day, mild or severe, simple or way out of the box. Let's collaborate and help all of us to feel better.

[Note that I started a very similar post in /r/anxiety, and it is NOT an xpost. Depression and anxiety often go hand in hand, but they definitely warrant separate conversations just as they have separate subreddits. Please feel welcome to join the discussion on both threads. **Let's get better you guys!**]
