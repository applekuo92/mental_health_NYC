It was early in the morning and no one was home so I decided that this would be the day I do it. I grabbed some rope out of the garage, found out how to tie a noose and got the whole setup completed. I get up to make sure i was all set. I then kicked the table over but the rope snapped at the middle and I fell flat on my ass. I was silent for a second but then I started laughing uncontrollably. It was the greatest laugh I've had in years.

EDIT: Wow guys thanks for all the kind responses! Makes me feel a bit better!
