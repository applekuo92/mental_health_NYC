Does anyone else sleep like 15+ hours a day as an escape?

During the week, I work a desk job and during lunch I go in my car to sleep for an hour.  I feel like I can't focus on work, and I'm always online reading subreddits about depression/breakups/no-contact.  I'm recently getting over a breakup from a 4.5 year relationship (I was the dumpee) and am now in a friends with benefits situation, but I'm developing feelings. This is just adding fuel to the fire, I know, but I have always relied on a guy to make me happy, and as someone being depressed I think that short term happiness is more desirable than thinking in the long term.  

I still live at home and have about 2 friends.  I work all week looking forward to the weekend just to sleep all day.  I take naps to escape the feeling of loneliness/unhappiness and when I wake up I check my phone.  If it's not from my 'friend with benefits' I become more sad and just go back to bed hoping when I wake up the next time I'll have a text from him.

This is a horrible way to live life.  I'm 23 years old, this should be the time where I'm hanging out with friends / exercising / spending time with family / going on dates.  I've tried all those things but honestly I'd rather be sleeping ...

Does anyone else have similar habits?
