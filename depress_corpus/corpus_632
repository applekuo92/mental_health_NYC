That line from the Wallflowers song comes to mind--"this place is always such a mess, sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn."

I managed to sit up and clean my apartment in a frenzy. I feel like I can relax a little more. I just spent weeks staring at the accumulation of nonsense and clutter and I finally just sat up and cleaned.

Feels good. Small victories.
