When I was younger, my mom told me that my eyes made it seem like I was always laughing, even during serious discussions. She sometimes couldn't stay mad at me because of how happy I looked. Now all I see when I look at my eyes in pictures or in the mirror is ... nothing. Even when I'm smiling. Years of anxiety and depression have taken that away from me. Anyone else feel the same way?
