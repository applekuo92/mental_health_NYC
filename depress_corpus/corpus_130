I realized a few days ago that I was suffering from maladaptive daydreaming for the last 10 years.For those who don’t know about [Maladaptive daydreaming](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiynrjw2MLLAhXQwY4KHZNAChkQFggbMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMaladaptive_daydreaming&usg=AFQjCNH7SXZedX3BicLpcZmzNWN4mTrJQg&bvm=bv.116636494,d.c2E&cad=rja)


Physically I was living one life and mentally I was living 3-4 versions of myself.This may sound ridiculous but it is true. All my life,I thought I had no dreams,aims,goals,aspirations or whatever.I was lackadaisical about most of the things in life.


During 8th grade, I started daydreaming.At that time I thought it was probably the best use I can make of my mind.I can be anyone I want.I can do anything I want.I can do this by just imagining stuff.For hours I dreamt about things that I wanted.At that time I wanted to be a footballer.


I would imagine playing for my favourite football club,playing for my country.All of those scenarios I made up my mind.I became lazier.The girl I had a crush on, I would imagine spending time with her.The same thing continued for 2-3 years. As I took admission in an average college,I started to imagine that I am in a top,well known college. Returning home after college, I resume my daydreaming again.


There was a point when I thought sleeping is a better option.I had 4-5 dreams per session of sleep. My life had become so boring that I used to sleep for about 20 hours so that I could have something interesting atleast in my dreams.The daydreaming was not going to end.
I had 3-4 versions of myself which I roleplayed in my mind.


1 a football player 

2.An ordinary citizen with a good job and a SO 

3.This roleplay was used by me for NSFW purposes.


After college,being indecisive as ever,these versions started influencing me. I spent more time daydreaming.After I failed to crack an exam required for higher education,I started daydreaming about successfully cracking that exam and taking admission to a new college. All the failures in my life were overshadowed by daydreaming.Maybe this is why I am jobless,with no life at all.I was as depressed as one can get. I tried to quit this habit of daydreaming.


All the characters that I created in my fantasies spoke with me all the time. I try to avoid them as much as I can, but they have become a part of me.


As of now I have’nt daydreamed for a day and this probably is the longest I’ve gone.Thank you for reading this and no I don’t have suicidal thoughts
