I just wanted to say that you guys are an amazing group of people. I've seen lives saved by you folks and even if you do nothing else in your life, I want each and every one of you to know that you have done your purpose in life. It's amazing to see so many people take time out of their day to help others who suffer from something so horrible. If I could, I would give every single one of you gold. But seeing as how I can't afford that, I do give all of you my blessing. Save this post, because when there's no one else to talk to, I'm here for each and every one of you.
