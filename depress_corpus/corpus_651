I take a little too much cold medicine and BAM, back into the depression.  I get a little too little sleep and the dark cloud is back.  I exercise every day, I don't drink alcohol, I eat healthy, I take my fucking pill, it doesn't matter.  I'm fucking stuck with this bullshit brain and its fucked up chemistry.  

I look around at happy families gathering for brunch at the holidays and I seethe with jealousy and bitterness.  I don't feel able to give or receive love right now, just hatred and darkness.  

I can't leave my husband behind, I've promised him I wouldn't do that.  So now I'm angry that I can't even off myself.  Shitty day. 


Edit:  I do realize I sound like a spoiled child.
