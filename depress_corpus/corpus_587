He was only 19. Why did he do it? He was lonely, he was scared, he hated himself. These are these the things he had told me before, and I fucking patted his shoulder and told him it would be okay. It looks like he posted here a couple times during his two years on reddit. He lived online. He always told me about how disappointed he was with himself.  How 'college was supposed to be the best time of his life' but he was wasting it in his dorm room. He was a bit of a recluse growing up, and we were never really close, but he was still my little bro. I have so much anger for the people that used to bully him and led him to believe he was worthless. I don't know why I'm posting here other than to create some sort of personal eternal memorial for him. I know you felt like you were alone, but goddamn I miss you little bro.

Thank you all for your thoughtful comments. You are all truly wonderful people
