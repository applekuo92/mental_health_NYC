I've been depressed for years, in the last six months it became severe, and I tried to kill myself. I haven't been able to concentrate or focus since. Today is the first day I've done any kind of schoolwork for half a year. I wrote a [whole page of notes](http://imgur.com/a/PwTZx) and studied for half an hour. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it's a huge win for me, and I wanted to share it with people who understand. I'm 16, and I dropped out of school last year because I couldn't do anything. Now I'm finally getting back on track :)
