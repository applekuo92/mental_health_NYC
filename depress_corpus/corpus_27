I would probably never commit suicide although Ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things.  somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems.
