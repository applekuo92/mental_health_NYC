i skipped school because i woke up so depressed it felt like my soul was being sucked into a vacuum, so i went into the bathroom and sat in the shower for two hours dissociating and when my mom finally made me get out because "you cant just sit in the shower all day" so i crawled under the blanket in my dark room without even bothering to get dressed and slept until 3pm.

i havent eaten anything today, other than a candy bar because it was the only edible thing in my room and my will to not leave my room and face any part of the world that exists outside of it (even if it's just my kitchen) is stronger than my appetite (which is nonexistent when i feel this fucking horrible anyway)

but i drank a bottle of water. kind of pathetic that the dark hole that im trapped in has become so low that just drinking water is an accomplishment. maybe tomorrow ill accomplish brushing my teeth.

edit: i fucking love you guys
