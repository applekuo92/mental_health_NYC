This world is hopeless. I have tried many different medications and therapists and nothing's working. I'm a socially retarded 19 year old boy. I hate college. I haven't made a friend in a year, much less met any interesting girls. I don't thoroughly enjoy or have interest in anything, and I've tried many things. Being alone is worse than being with people, though. I'm borderline homeless and it's 90 percent inevitable that I will become a bum. Once there, life becomes even darker and more hopeless. I have terrible anxiety that leaves me down for days over the simplest things. My health is declining. I can't drive so I don't get to live a normal life. Pretty much I'm saying my life is shit and I feel hopeless constantly. I have been suffering (mostly emotionally and mentally, but also a small amount of physical) 19 years and nothing's changed, so why would it? I think about suicide every day. I just want to lay in bed forever. And new problems arise every day. I'm so tired...
