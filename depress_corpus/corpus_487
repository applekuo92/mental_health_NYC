I made it a whole day without crying. It sounds so small and it's pretty sad that I'm so stoked about it, but it really is an accomplishment at this point. I have cried so much, and I am so tired of crying that for it not to happen all day (shit, I didn't even come close) is nothing short of a miracle. I hope this doesn't come off as too much of a bummer. I just feel like things are getting better, even if it's just one tearless day at a time.
