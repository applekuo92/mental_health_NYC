Just less than two years ago, I left university on medical grounds after a suicide attempt.

These days, I have a degree in mathematics and have just been offered a job at triple the salary I currently work at (I earn peanuts at the moment).

It has been a very difficult two years, but I have never given up no matter how low I got and it has paid off. Yay!

All those thoughts in my head of being completely useless, I will not and have not let you take over me. 

Stay strong /r/depression,  we can all do this :-)
