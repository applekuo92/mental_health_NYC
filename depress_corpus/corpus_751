I don't really *want* anything, so I just try to fake it. I pretend I'm into whatever it is my friends are interested in. I pretend I like going to see movies with them. I just spent 3 days at a gaming convention where I pretended to enjoy myself.

I feel like the only thing I genuinely want, is food and sleep. I wish I wanted things. Even simple, stupid shit. I have a friend who is passionate about Lego and can't wait to buy his next Lego set. I'd love to be that passionate about something. I don't care how trivial it is at this point. I just want to look forward to something or enjoy a hobby. 

Everybody else seems to know so much about their favourite topic and they never seem to get tired of it. I just don't understand.
