I catch myself doing this A LOT to the point where I half expect a portal to the past to open right in front of me. The littlest things will get me thinking on how differently i could've done things to lead my life on a better path. I usually daydream about my mistakes and how i couldve done them differently all day which i know isn't healthy at all. I just don't know how to think about anything else at this point...
