This is the kind of attitude I'm picking up from a lot of mental health workers. It doesn't matter if I'm in bed 24/7, as long as I don't hurt myself it's all good. 

The reality is, nobody really gives a shit about you (unless you have close friends and family, which I don't). The only reason they don't want you to do it is because you're worth more to the government alive and someone would have to clean you up. 

I hate life.
