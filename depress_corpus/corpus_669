It's a term I coined to try to explain what I've been feeling. I don't think I could ever put a gun to my head or hang myself, more active things, so instead, I just do nothing. I spend time online, shut myself off from everyone, live in my own little world. I don't look for a job, don't try to better myself, in a hope that passively, my world will fall down around me somehow, and will take me with it.

Anybody else relate to this?

Edit: Wow, so many replies, many of them very sad and worrisome. If anyone wants to talk, feel free to PM me. Maybe we could start some sort of group chat.
