I've been in love with my best friend for years (I'm a guy, she's a girl). We've hooked up and have a very open relationship but have always just stayed friends. I've never tried to pursue anything more because she's an incredibly happy, smart, and outgoing person. While I'm horribly depressed, anxious, and reclusive. 

I feel like a lot of girls who are happy are almost drawn to this. I've purposely manipulated every potential relationship with any girl because I know I'll ruin their life. I can't take care of myself. I'll just drag them down and they'll leave me eventually. It's too much. I'm too empty.

Anyone else feel this way? That if you get in a relationship you'll be a huge burden?

I just need to find someone who is as equally fucked up as me and we can lay in bed all day together.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses everyone. While it's shitty that so many people feel this way, it can be comforting and therapeutic to know that you're not alone. I would try and respond to all of you guys but i'm exhausted, you get it. Hope we can all find love someday.
