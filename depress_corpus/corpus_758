Doesn't need much more explanation than the title.  Rejection is a pretty big trigger for me.  Not looking forward to the next few days.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words.  I need to get out of my own head and stop taking everything so personally.  This community has helped a lot when I'm at low points.   Thanks
