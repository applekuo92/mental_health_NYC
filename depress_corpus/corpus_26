I've recently come to terms with my depression. Ive contemplated suicide, but i don't think I will ever do it. But every day, when I'm driving to school, I have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me. I think that's just an excuse for my selfish desire to die. I think it would be better for my family. The memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved. I would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issues. They would just say it was an unfortunate accident. Does anyone else think like this?
