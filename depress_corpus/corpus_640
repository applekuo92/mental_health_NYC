Yesterday my little sister, 18, committed suicide. She left a stack of about 25-30 notes addressed to people. In my letter she entrusted me to deliver her letters and belongings she wanted returned to her friends. Her friend's father got involved when my mom showed him the letter left for her friend. He said he will photocopy all the originals and hand deliver the letters and her belongings. He said we (mom, dad, older brother (25), and I) should sit down and decide what to do with her letters.

I had eavesdropped on that whole conversation. I got SO angry, and still am. I feel like I have failed my sister by not delivering the letter myself. She entrusted ME with them. I so badly want to scream at her friend's father to leave because she asked me to do it. She told me what she wants. I can't fail.. I won't.

My parents made me go to school today. Then they said I didn't have to go, but I still went because I didn't want to be home. They asked if I want to take a break from school. I'm a junior at a University, a 20 minutes commute away from home. I told them if I don't keep going I won't graduate in time. My dad said whatever the reason may be that I don't need to graduate in time. I don't want to let my sister down, but I can't bring myself to focus on school right now. I don't know what to do.

edit: i'm her older sister. we are only 2 years apart since she just turned 18. we're really close but i guess not enough.
