I've literally never ever heard anybody say that in my life. I've been with some pretty shitty people, but everyone has always been supportive when I'm not in a good place. Him saying that lead to huge argument and I had to leave. I mean, getting better is a choice. But is not as easy for everybody. Who the hell would choose to be depressed and having Anxiety and any kind of mental disorder? That alone makes me just want to leave him. I can't stay with somebody who thinks that way about mental disorderS. Am I in the wrong? Am I overreacting?
