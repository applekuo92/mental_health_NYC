I'm sure someone has already posted something like this, but I came across this subreddit and decided posting could be a good distraction that actually helps me in some way. 

I know this method just makes things worse, but right now it's about choosing the lesser of two evils. I either try to go to sleep normally and spend the night spiraling into despair and self loathing or I fuck up my sleep by staring at a computer screen all night. The only way I can fall asleep anymore is by forcing myself to stay awake until my body knocks me out. I just wish I could lie down in bed, count sheep or some shit and drift to sleep like a normal person, but nope. It's like my brain's default setting is self destruction. As soon as I'm not distracted BOOM time to go over all the reasons why you hate yourself. 

I'm so tired.

Edit: uh, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/57envd/theres_an_aggressively_destructive_voice_in_my/) a follow-up to this post I guess
