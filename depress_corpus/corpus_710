To put it simply, I moved to Japan as an exchange student when I was 18 and been living here for two years. Despite all of my efforts, language barrier and cultural difference finally has taken its toll to my mental health and I've never been so depressed all my life. Not to mention that I've developed a binge eating disorder. 
I used to be a productive and positive person, but for this past two months I would just sit around, do nothing, bingeing on junk foods, feel guilty and throw it all up. And then I would cry myself to sleep every single night.  

Yesterday I decided that I have to do something if I want to change for the better. I called my close friends, and told them about my problems. At first I was hesitant about telling anyone because I feel embarrassed about my eating disorder and being homesick, but to my surprise they're being supportive and not judgmental. That alone had helped me through and gave me the motivation to clean my apartment that I've been neglected while I was being depressed. Now that my room is clean, I feel happier!

I am hoping that the idea of clean environment = happier me will motivate me to tidy up a bit every day.
