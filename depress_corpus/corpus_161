I've stopped feeling like I have any personality. Only friends who I've known for a very long time know that I'm a real person, but whenever I meet new people, I feel like I'm that friend-of-a-friend who people meet and then say "Wow, so-and-so's friend really had no personality, did they?" 

I'm so fucking exhausted and anxious most of the time, I can't hold a conversation. I just sit around and let everyone else do the talking with each other. I don't feel like a real person when I'm around anyone other than my two older friends because they're the only ones who know that I actually do have some sort of personality lying around somewhere. 

If I do meet anyone with interests similar to mine, my anxiety keeps me from starting a conversation with them.
I'm so tired of all of this. I miss being able to function like a normal person. (If I ever was able to, to begin with)

Edit: It feels so good to see that there are other people going through this and to see others talking to each other and trying to help each other out in the comments.
