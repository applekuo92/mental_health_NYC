I don't want to kill myself because I don't think I can. I make plans every day and I just chicken out, thinking stuff like I'll only end up injuring or damaging myself further and making everything more miserable

But am I alone in wishing for things like getting run over, getting caught in a gunfight, or just peacefully drifting off and dying?

I always feel like I'm so alone, and I'm such a failure, like there's nothing to look forward to and as life goes on it will only go downhill. I'm so uncomfortable. This is a new one actually. I can't explain it. I'm just so unhappy in my skin, there's something bothering me so much all of a sudden and I wish I could jump out of my body to get away from this discomfort

I don't even know why I'm posting here, I wasn't diagnosed with depression. But I was diagnosed with anxiety a year ago or so

Edit - Gosh, thank you all so much for your incredible response! I wasn't too sure what to expect, but it was great hearing so much from all of you. i feel like maybe i'm not alone in feeling weird things. I'll respond to anybody i missed tomorrow after resting a little, it's bedtime for me... until then!
