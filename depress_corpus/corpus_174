New years kinda gets to me emotionally. I worked until 11pm so I could distract myself for most of it but when I got home it all kinda hit me. I see all my friends have girlfriends/boyfriends with them, holding onto each other, looking into each others eyes full of anticipation for a new year. Then I see me, completely alone, just sitting in my house, contemplating "is 2016 gonna be the year I go through with it and OD"? Then it hit me even more...while my friends and colleagues were having a great time, I was just alone seriously contemplating killing myself.

Why do I have to be like this? I thought I actually had a tight grip on my depression, but NYE proved otherwise.
