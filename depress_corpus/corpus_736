I got up and out of bed. I didn't have the energy to shower but I brushed my hair. I put on real clothes and I got up. I spent time outside in the sunshine with my mom and sister. I'm so proud of myself for finally gletting the strength to get out of bed for a few hours. It's more than I've done in a week. I did it! 

Tomorrow my goal is to get up before lunchtime, shower, and brush my teeth. It may not seem like a lot but I'm trying to be patient with myself.

Update - I made a new post https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/37i5ie/update_im_the_one_that_finally_got_out_of_bed/ 

Things are worse tonight. The night is always my worst time. I really wish I had more people to talk to and get support. I just want to be pain free.
