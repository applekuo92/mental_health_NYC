so stressed my body is failing on me. other peoples' happiness is just fueling my depression now. im so jealous, i'd give anything to be a normal person with normal parents but no, i got the shit end of the stick. they all get their futures paid for them by mummy and daddy whereas I have to struggle to survive on my own because both my parents are batshit too
im over life. i cant deal with the financial stress and crippling depression anymore.
