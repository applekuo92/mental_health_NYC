For example I'm always convinced everyone hates me and that no one would care if I committed suicide. But every once in awhile I can stand back and look at myself more objectively. I realize I must come off as a huge loser for always saying that everyone against me and no one likes me when in reality I'm sure some people do. 

The irony is that I think I'm an loser because everyone hates me. But in reality I'm a loser because not everyone hates me and I can't accept it. You'd think I'd be happy if someone says they enjoy being with me. Instead I just tell them to fuck off.

I guess either way I'm a loser so it doesn't really make a difference.
