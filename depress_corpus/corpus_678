One minute you feel fine, and then a tiny thing, a thought, a conversation, can remind you of how terrible you feel, and sink you right back down into that dark place. And it always feels so selfish and stupid, like throwing a temper tantrum. It's like: "I was feeling good before but one little thing made me sad again, I don't have any right to feel this way." I feel like I should only feel sad if something really bad happens, not just because the good mood went away, or something a bit off happened. I hate it. I feel so selfish and childish and terrible. How do you deal with this?
