I am just gonna disappear, just like the good old days. I got my backpacking gear all packed up, plus my my meals n shit. I just need to get away for a while. I while maybe set up next to a stream like last time. While I am there I will have some books and cards. Don't worry about me, I have done this a couple times before.
Anyways I will be away for a couple days, also fuck school. It's making me miserable, and the good old outdoors will refresh me and hopefully bring my spirits back up. I just need to enjoy myself and forget about the consequences. I will post when I get back, see y'all later.
