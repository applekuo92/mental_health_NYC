I wake up with all the things I should do running through my head. I need to shower, I should walk my dog, I should talk to people. I just dismiss it all by pushing it to the side and end up lying in bed all day telling myself I'll do it later. I'm still in bed and all I've managed to do is browse reddit for hours. Anyone else accomplished absolutely nothing today?
