However, this time, I broke up with her, and nothing bad happened. Although she cried and didn't let me get a word in or let me leave, I just stood up and left. I'm so fucking proud of doing that.  I feel so free, unchained, and happy. This is the best I've felt in months. Albeit I'm happy that I'm out of the relationship with her but I do feel alone and unloved because now I have nobody to look towards when I crave romantic affection, which is pretty often. I'm just glad that I'm out of that relationship, whether I feel lonely or not.
