Sorry for my bad english i'll try my best to explain
i need to talk to someone for real because right now my life been really shitty... i've move out from where i grew up since 2 years ago now and ever since then it's been very hard for me i try to stay strong but sometimes i feel very suicidal and that i don't belongs to  this world anymore but i always get back on track so basically i'm still in high school and i'm living a tough times i don't know if i'm going to graduate because i got very bad grades i've never love or enjoy school i hated it so much and i skip school a lot because i'm tired of my professor and people in my school. I feel a lot of stressed  when i'm at my school. I don't really have friends at my school i only hangout with 2 peoples that i consider like my friends but i don't think they feel the same way for me so i'm actually alone all by myself i'm naturally shy and introvert and i try my best to makes friends and talk to people but it seems that nobody's is interesting by talking to me because of that i feel like crap like i'm nothing... i also got a lot of critics and mocks because of my weight.I always hide my feelings in front of people to looks strong and  like i feel nothing but inside it kills me and everynight i cry so bad.It's even worse because nobody's support me even my family don't support me i've got 1 brother and he is the favorite child he always get what he wants he even treat me like a complete  piece of shit and my parents is always on his side he always got an excuse and i've got none.Anyways i just want to talk to someone i feel very lonely like it's me against the world nobody's have ever support me or liked me really...it seems that all my life people been using me because of my kindness and put me down i'm always there for people support them being attentive to them try to help etc... but no one give that back to me :( 

Once again sorry for my bad english
