I've had an epiphany about my anxiety and depression. Most of my anxiety comes from a fear of rejection, a fear of being judged and a fear of being made fun of, which in turn makes me depressed because I feel like I can't talk to anyone, especially females. But I came to a realization of how I can use this to my advantage and loophole my own depression and anxiety...By using my depression and anxiety against itself. If I'm already convinced that I'm going to be made fun of, rejected or judged...Then fuck it, why not go for it? I may as well just go talk to the cute Asian girl at the store. I can't fail my own expectations because my expectation is to fail...So what will happen? Either it will go as expected or better than expected. You can't fail your expectations when you already expect to fail, so fuck it, I say go for it. My own fear and anxiety is working against itself.

I'm not sure if this will work for others but it's certainly something to think about.
