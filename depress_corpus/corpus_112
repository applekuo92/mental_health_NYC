I always search up certain symptoms to understand where certain feelings/thoughts are coming from, but they never pop up. Here's a thread for the seriously disgusting, unknown ones that you feel embarrassed talking to your therapist about. I'll start.

1. I want to have a chronic illness (like cancer) so that I don't have to commit suicide, although I will if I am absolutely done.

2. Sometimes I randomly cry, for no reason at night.

3. I often feel homicidal and it sickens me.

4. I feel comfortable in my depression, I feel comfortable being sad, I feel comfortable NOT going outside. It's like a really sick morbid embrace. It makes me cry how much I don't want to get better; I just feel like I'm meant to die, like it would do the world a favour if I don't get better and I just die.

5. Sometimes I feel like depression is the only thing that's been there for me, since all my friends and family have given up on me. And that the least I can do for it, after helping me by standing by me so much all this while, is to finally kill myself.

Share yours, as horrible as they may be. Not talking about it makes you feel more alone.
