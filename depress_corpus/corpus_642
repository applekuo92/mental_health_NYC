I was just looking at a facebook post that linked to a video regarding depression. The woman in the video had taken a photo of herself every day for six years as she battled with depression. One of the most 'liked' comments on the video was: 

"Depressed people don't usually feel like taking selfies."

What the heck. 

I had what's called 'walking depression', I know many of you on here have or had that as well. I woke up every morning on time, was punctual to every class. I ate lunch with friends, sometimes, and I skyped with people from back home. I made jokes about my depression because that was the only way I knew to talk about it.

I also immediately went to sleep for hours the moment I got back to my dorm room. I started crying every time I opened up a textbook because the hopelessness I felt about school and life was just overwhelming. I self-harmed, I wanted to die, I almost tried to make it happen several times.

My sister has also struggled with depression for years. She has a sleep disorder that makes her sleep very ineffective, so she struggles with chronic fatigue. When her depression is at its worst, she can't even get out of bed for the moment it takes her to take the medicine that helps her wake up. She doesn't go to any class, she doesn't see or talk to people. 

And you know what? Fuck anyone who says that one type is more 'real' than the other. Fuck anyone who says that my depression isn't actually depression because I was able to get out of bed. Fuck anyone who says my sister 'isn't trying' because she can't. 

Your experience is YOUR experience. Don't let anyone downplay that. Don't let anyone try to tell you that what you've gone through isn't real because you don't fit into their ignorant, narrow bubble of what depression is. You know what is true because you've felt it and you've experienced it and you CAN trust that. 

Just don't let the confusion and the hate convince you that you're weak or you're faking it. You know what's true.
