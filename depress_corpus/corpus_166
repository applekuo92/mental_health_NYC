Tonight I was at the park playing Pok√©mon Go. I had just gotten off of work and thought it would be relaxing to walk around and catch some mons before I went home. While I was there, I decided to roll up the sleeves on my sweater because I was overheating. Underneath is a 7" long vertical scar. Immediately afterward, I met a guy about four years younger than me. We talked a little bit and he started following me around the park. He seemed nice, so I had no problem with this. About ten minutes in, he made a joke about suicide. "No big deal", I thought, "he probably hasn't noticed my scar." As we continued, the jokes got more frequent. I began to get suspicious, but didn't want to be too reactant. After about an hour, we sat on a bench near two lured stops and he was making near constant sarcastic remarks about "killing himself" while intermittently looking at my scar and smirking. Two minutes later, his friend (new to me) sat down and joined in. I diffused the situation gracefully and got them to leave, but I went home and felt really low. All I was trying to do was enjoy some time out of the house and play my game and these idiots completely ruined my night. It was a huge trigger, but I've calmed down. Regardless, what would motivate a person to be so cruel when they are completely unprovoked?
