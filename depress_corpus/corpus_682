Just a thought I had a while ago that I like to point out. I'm not saying there's no value in hard work, but I'm really sick of the feel-good bullshit that we get from pop culture about how everyone's a winner, we're all special, hard work always pays off, etc etc... I had passions in life that I gave 110%, spending absolutely all of my time on them, and they amounted to absolutely nothing. I have severe limitations that others don't have. I'm not going to be successful and I understand that. I'm honestly getting sick of being told otherwise.
