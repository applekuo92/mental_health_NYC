So these classes weren't for summer credit. However, the university has a mental health recovery program. I needed something to do this summer. My life was lacking structure and purpose. I signed up on a whim and gave mindfulness meditation class a chance. It was amazing being surrounded by supportive people. I finally feel hopeful about my circumstances. There's a glimmer of hope to turn things around.  I'm really thankful for having awesome professors and counselors.
