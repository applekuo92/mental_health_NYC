I thought it would suck and had anxiety about it the whole day especially because I had two tickets but no one wanted to go with me, but I actually had an AMAZING time. It was a Sufjan Stevens concert who is my favorite artist ever so I really got to absorb his music live without being distracted by anyone else, it was a really personal and cathartic experience. 

The only thing that kinda affected me was seeing all the friend groups and couples around me, it made me lust and miss someone, but otherwise I am glad that I went even if it was alone.
