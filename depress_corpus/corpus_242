It has had a profound effect on a lot of people, myself included. :)

If you feel up to it, I'd love for you to comment with:

Your name (or user name) / Your age / Where you're from / What you struggle with / And the best part: a link to a recent pic of yourself. 

Never mind the quality or size of the pic, I just want to see my fellow humans ðŸ’™ it's a whole lot more fun and special when more people comment! 

If this isn't ok please feel free to delete, and of course don't share anything you aren't comfortable with. 

Peace xo

EDIT: Ohh, man... You're all such amazing, glorious people. 
I will happily admit I get really emotional reading through all of the comments and replies here... A very confusing emotional; deep sadness for the collective pain that we are all experiencing, but also a real warmth, and.. sense of connection? 
Seeing everyone commenting on each other's posts, offering advice or sympathy or empathy or just plain old love... It wasn't the point of the post. It wasn't a requirement. It happened naturally, and it's beautiful. 
I don't swear, but you're all fucking beautiful.
