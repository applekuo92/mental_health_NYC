I feel pretty good right now, guys. Just a little bit of info, I've been self harming since I was 10. For 7 years I've never worn short sleeves outside because I was afraid that someone would find out or judge me because of it.

Today, I'm finally ending this cycle of self harm. I've kept myself clean and resisted urges for 2 years, waiting for the day I could finally replace the scars with something I love: books. Specifically, a literary tattoo!

Here's a comparison photo (warning: may be triggering, contains scar photos): https://i.imgur.com/wObD7Hk.jpg It's only half done, but I felt like sharing anyway!

The lightbulb is inspired by Anthem by Ayn Rand, the moth by The Death of the Moth by Virginia Woolf, and some nice green roses to represent Oscar Wilde. All represents individuality, finality, and pride in being "different". These works and people kept me alive through the years.

Thanks for listening. I don't post often, only when I feel really, really bad. This time I'm glad to be posting something good. :) 

EDIT: here's a proper look at the tattoo: https://i.imgur.com/sZwYDHT.jpg
