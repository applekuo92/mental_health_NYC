It would certainly be better than the alternative. Wouldn't it? I think I never recognized the depth of my internal problems until verbalizing the thought that "living is so hard. dying just seems so much easier."

I am surrounded by death, and I am also surrounded by people who have never in their lives experienced death. It's an odd situation. But one that I can summarize: I come from a 'destitute' background, and go to a prestigious university. 

Sounds like something right out of a cliched novel. But in the past few years I've lost my grandparents, my parents, and my dog. 

It's turned into a system. After each funeral, I come back to my picturesque college campus: a proverbial land of plenty, surrounded by wealthy peers who call me "deranged" and "problematic" and "abnormal". 

When I first got a full-ride to this school, I felt like Alice entering Wonderland. Now I feel like the Grim Reaper, suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, trapped in Zombieland. I don't understand the world I'm in on this campus, I don't understand the unrelenting personalities of my peers, and somehow, I can't imagine leaving. 

So as I cross the intersection to class every morning, I imagine what it would be like if that Escalade were to just run the red light.
