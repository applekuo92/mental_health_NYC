It is currently 2015 in Australia and tonight I spent my NYE on the grass in my backyard alone, crying whilst listening to the party happening next door. I was not invited anywhere, nor did I receive any of the generic 'Happy New Year' texts. 
Tonight, however, I can say that I got through one of the hardest fucking years of my life without ending it. My resolution this year is to start celebrating these small wins. No matter what you are doing on your NYE, I hope you are okay and safe, and I am positive that this year may have some amazing things in store for you. 

Edit: Woah I totally didn't expect this level of response, thank you /r/depression for making me feel like I'm not so alone. Thanks to all your kind words I honestly can say that my first day of 2015 has been amazing.
