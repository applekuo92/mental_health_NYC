These are the links to the three previous resource post lists. There is a lot to look through, but knowledge can be your best weapon. There are recommended videos, books, articles, resources, guides, how to help yourself, how to help others, research, military specific resources, quotes from literary memoirs and medical journals, reddit comments and discussions, and much more. I posted these links at different times, so each link has additional information I had found from the previous post (there are character limits to posts). I am sorry that many of my links are just that- links- rather than descriptions of the links, but I keep editing as I can to make these lists more user friendly and easier to navigate, and I am constantly adding to the lists as I find more information worth sharing. I was going to just create a brand new post combining all like categories from the three resources posts (for example, all the videos in one section), but I thought many of the comments and discussion generated on those original posts may be just as helpful to read as the resources themselves. This has been a work in progress over two years. Pretty much everything on these lists are resources I am personally recommending because I see value to them- not just whatever comes up when you type "depression" into google.  

Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions.

edit 1: some of you have messaged me about links no longer working. Please let me know if you encounter any problems with the links since I haven't checked them all lately to see if they are still active, especially the videos which are often removed for copyright reasons. I will try to track down and replace the outdated links if I can.
