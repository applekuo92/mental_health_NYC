Yeah. I get that the feeling of depression aren't permanent. They come and they go. But the cycle is permanent. Pills, no pills, money, no money, it doesn't matter. No matter how happy I may be I know that it's only temporary as well. I can deal with the thought of being depressed for a few weeks. But being depressed every few weeks for the next 50 years? No thanks.
