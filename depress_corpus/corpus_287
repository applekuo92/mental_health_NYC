I have noticed that my depression is so much worse when I'm alone, but I hate spending time with people because of how uncomfortable I feel around them. When I have a day off from work I often choose to be alone and depressed because at least then I can relax. I hate the thought of spending a day off with friends because the day will just be over in a flash, it will have been stressful, and then bam - I'm back at work before I know it, surrounded by people again.
