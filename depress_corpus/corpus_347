So my lack of drive and interests means all I do in my free time is numb my brain with YouTube videos that I don't remember the content of 5 minutes after watching, sums up pretty much anything I do on the internet really. So my life seems extremely boring, and it is. I sleep in whenever I can, I have no plans for the future and no projects I've finished. I usually can't hold a conversation for very long , because, well, I have nothing to talk about. But oh boy, that doesn't mean my brain is like that, I constantly fight suicidal thoughts, my depression nukes my anxiety and it retaliates with waves of anxiety attacks and sleepless nights. I don't even know how I've made it this far but if I keep going like this I'll become a vegetable and my brain will explode. 

I can't relate to people much anymore because I don't "experience" life the same way. Making new friends is practically impossible and keeping the ones I've made is becoming increasingly difficult.
