My two closest friends ignore my messages all day.  
Forget to reply.  
Read, no reply.  
Never message me spontaneously.  
They know about my anxiety/depression.     
They know I just stopped seeing my psych because he was a dickhead.  
But can't even get a reply to a message.
No one cares! About me.
