A ton of my comments are about my experience with something.

"**I** did this, **I** had this feeling" instead of "**You** must be having a hard time. Do **you** need help?"


a lot of time i just don't know how to give good advice so i'll just keep my mouth shut

If I do this just ignore me. And, this goes without saying, but thanks, for putting up with my shit in the first place.
