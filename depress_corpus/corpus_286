I was struggling not to cry in front of my mother when I tried to explain what I was going through. She asked me about this subreddit and I told her its not really about giving advice. It's just to let others know, "I understand". Needless to say, after I said that I became a waterfall. I thought of all the suicidal posts.  The amount of pain that we are collectively going through and how "I understand" can give us so much comfort that in some cases it prevents us from pulling the trigger. So much pain, such isolated sea of pain. I freaking love you guys and if someday I were to get rid of this illness I don't see how I will continue my life without helping people like you and me. <3 <3
