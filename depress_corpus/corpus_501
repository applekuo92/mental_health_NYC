**Edit 1: Thanks for all the kind comments and for the Gold! I will start looking through comments soon and sending some games. Please send your thanks to /u/anarchoqueer who has also been gifting people games :)**

**Edit 2: New game added: Skyrim Vanilla (Steam gift)**

**Edit 3: /u/anunnaturalselection has kindly donated DEFCON to the giveaway, please comment if you would like it from him!**

Hi everyone,

I did a similar giveaway last year and it was really well received. As the title says I have a load of steam keys and gifts leftover from various bundles/purchases. I know gaming really helps me get through tough episodes and so I wanted to try and help others who get the same benefits, especially during the holidays which can be difficult for a lot of people.

All you have to do is comment back saying which game you would like. Please type it as shown in the list so I can easily find them with CTRL+F :)
If more than one person wants a game I will pick someone at random to make it fair.

I will either pm you or email you the key, or I will send it over steam if you like.

Feel free to [add me](http://steamcommunity.com/id/votequimby) if you ever need to talk or want to game :)

I will give the thread a few hours before I start sending keys to make sure more people can see it, and I would rather not give keys to brand new accounts or to anyone who is obviously abusing the giveaway (basically going by the /r/randomactsofgaming rules).

Here are the games:
