I don't know what to write, this has been in my head for the past two days and it's killing me. Please, listen to me.

It was my mum's birthday. I was intent on killing myself, I was miserable and reluctant. I called my dad. I cried, told him I can't do anything anymore. He yelled at me, told me I was an attention seeker and that I try to make everything about myself, my mum said the same thing. I screamed, cried and picked up a knife. I eventually put it down because I didn't want to die. I just wanted to be loved, you see. I'm 14 and barely have any friends. I was left silent in their house for an hour. Nobody came. My siblings knew I was suicidal because they were told. I'm the youngest of them all.

My uncle accused me of being a drug-addict when I've barely talked to him in my life. I've never even taken drugs or alcohol (he accused me of doing that, too). I didn't act erratically, infact all I did do was cry. I feel like I'm going crazy. Please help me.. I know it sounds like there are parts I'm not telling you but I really am telling you all of it. I've been hospitalised once in my life and I didn't even tell my friends. 

I've been having trouble doing anything lately. I haven't been doing my washing, or making my food. If someone else doesn't do it for me then I don't eat at all because I feel too sad. They're kicking me out of the house and I don't know when I'll come back. 

I don't know how to conclude this other than I've known all this for pretty much the past two days. I feel so angry but I was fine before. It's killing me the more time goes by. please help.

edit: before all of this my parents called me names. they made fun of my weight & the fact i'm a girl. i've been called all the derogatory names you could think of. my parents have told me they wish i was aborted, that i caused World War Two, i'm a failure etc. i don't think i'll ever forget all the things that have happened to me but i wish i could.
