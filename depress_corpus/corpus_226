I found it on amazon and bought it impulsively. If you don't happen to watch Rick and Morty, a meeseeks is basically an instant genie that grants your wish and then disappears. But if a meeseeks can't complete its mission with a day or two, it starts to break down and malfunction. They say "existence is pain for a meeseeks" and if they're around too long, things get weird. 

Sometimes I look at that meeseeks doll and remember how it wanted so badly to disappear but it couldn't because it still had a mission to complete. And I relate to that in a way because even though I have those episodes of depression where I wish I could just disappear, I know I can't. I haven't finished my mission on this earth yet. So I can't leave until it's the right time. 

Sorry for the rambling. Just hope some of you can relate, even if it is just a cartoon.
