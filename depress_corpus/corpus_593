After years of struggling (and still dealing) with depression, anxiety, and anger, I asked my parents for an apology. 

I told them that because of the sexual abuse I faced as a child at the hands of my older brother, I faced very harsh realities in my life.  I wish they were there to protect me in my time of need. I was never sent to a doctor, therapist, or psychologist. They prayed over me at our shitty, judgmental little church and expected me to get better.

And I fucking didn't. 

I asked for an apology because I deserve one. 

I'm 25 years old and today, I'm taking my life back. I'm finally going to get the help I need.

To those of you who are struggling with shitty parents, family, or a fucked up past and they don't understand what you're going through, I'm right here with you, holding your hands. We got this.
