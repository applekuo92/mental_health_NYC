Reading the posts here and lurking has been great for me and really helped me understand that my feelings were common when I felt most alone. Over the past few months I've been busting my ass getting my life together and have been feeling positive, and reading the posts here (or even the titles), have given me pangs of the type of feelings I'm trying to avoid. You're all wonderful, beautiful people, and we're all going to make it :)
