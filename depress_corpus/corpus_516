Like, yes, I admit it. I want someone to pay attention to me. Because I feel like shit. I'm scared and lonely and spend about 75% of my day with thoughts like, "I don't want to exist anymore," running through my brain. I deal with it alone because no one wants to hear it, and therapists, aside from their uselessness in my experience, charge money I don't have. So yes, you caught me, I want someone's attention. Why is it so terrible to want that? Why is it okay to guilt me for that?

*edit* I guess I should say of "just wanting attention." Yes, obviously, depressed people often do WANT attention, but it's not in the selfish, manipulative way people often perceive it. It's because they need help because they're in a lot of pain.
