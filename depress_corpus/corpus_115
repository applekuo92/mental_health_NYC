Also, to aid the loneliness. Puppies need constant attention and training, which is time well spent for me. I have no friends really, and having my pup here has allowed me to use my superfluous time training an obedient dog. He needs me, I need him. He forces me to get out of the house (read: bed) when taking him for walks. I wake up earlier now every morning so he has a consistent feeding schedule. I can't seem to get up early or even out of bed for myself, but I can do it for him. I don't know, but I think he was a good decision for me.
