So to make a long story short I lost my daughter on April 16th of this year. I was so nervous at first to become a father, then I started to get excited and couldn't wait for her to be here.

Then she came early the morning of the 16th, and my fiance and I had the choice of aggressive measures to try and save her (there was really nothing they could have done, her lungs weren't developed and her eyes were still fused shut) or hold her and see her while she was still alive.

I'm only a 19 year old kid and I don't know how to handle this. I cry every day and sometimes just wish that I could just sleep and not wake up. Her name is Erin and she was the most precious and amazing little girl and I just want her back. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this or if all I did was complain, I just want to stop feeling like my chest is empty
