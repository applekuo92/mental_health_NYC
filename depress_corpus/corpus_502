I feel as though I can't connect to anyone anymore. 

I need someone to take a chance on me. To think that I'm worth getting to know and to take the time to do it. 

I've had this a few times in the past and it's how I made the few friends I ever had. But in the last couple of years I haven't come across anyone willing to be my friend. 

I'm miserable and lonely. It hurts like hell.
