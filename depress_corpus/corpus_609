Fuck I hate this question. Fuck off. I got home on friday night and sat in the shower with the water running until it turned cold then I went and made some horrible food because I can't cook and I can't even afford to eat lunch or breakfast 5/7 days of the week. Then I stayed up until 5 am in the morning on the computer because I haven't slept a full, restful, night in 8 months, then I got up at 7:30 am on saturday and wasted my whole god damned day worrying about getting fired at my job that barely pays enough for me to live. Oh and saturday night I got to cry. I cried for the first time in a long while. That was a nice break from the self-loathing and contempt I usually hold for myself. So I got that going for me right?

Is that what you want as an answer? No it's not! You want me to just say "Eh, nothing much you know just the usual what about you?"  so you can babble on about what YOU did instead. I'm so tired of small talk. I'm so tired of even trying to cobble together conversation with people who can't even be bothered to remember my name.
