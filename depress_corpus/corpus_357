Firstly, I just want to say this to everyone on this subreddit, **Thank you**.
I don't know where I would be without you, or if I would even be anywhere at all. I've actually talked to a lot of people on here, and to be honest, all of them have helped me in their own way.

But I don't belong here anymore. I don't wake up in the morning, wishing I had died in my sleep. I'm not in the awful place I have been in, anymore. And r/depression is such a big part of that. I'm not saying that someone else can cure your depression, but a friend can help more than at least I could have ever imagined. So please, if you have the energy, try to be there for each other. 
Because no one should be alone in a dark place.

I don't think I'm the only one who has dreamt about a button that, if pressed, would erase you from this life. A button to end your suffering, without leaving other people to grieve over your death. And you know what? If I had that button in front of me right now.... I wouldn't press it. 
Life isn't suddenly easy, but it doesn't feel like I'm constantly walking against the current. I can laugh again.

I don't know if this is stupid, but i just wanted to show to all of those who seriously doubt it's possible, it *can* change for you. I was severely depressed and I honestly wanted to die. But it got better for me. I wanted to say thanks and goodbye, because I'm unsubscribing this subreddit.

But if anyone ever needs someone to talk to, please write to me. No matter how unimportant you think you are, reaching out to someone could literally save a life. I know it did for me.

EDIT: thank you for all your nice responses!

EDIT 2: ok, your responses have been overwhelming. I wasn't sure whether to post this, since positivity and other people getting better sometimes only emphasizes your own misery, and I really didn't like that. But all the lovely comments you've given me, really made me happy.
