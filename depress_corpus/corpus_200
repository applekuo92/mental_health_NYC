On paper, my life isn't that bad at all compared to some people. I have a family, a job (not a good one but a job nonetheless), some friends (not as much as I hope to have but they're still good friends), never lost someone very close to me, live in a pretty good neighbourhood and in a wonderful country. I have no real reason to have depressed thoughts, yet I still feel like I wouldn't care if I stopped existing tomorrow. I have no SO or life goals or anything I'm really passionate about. When I think about my future, I see blank emptiness. I can't think of anything to live for.  

I always knew about this sub but never visited because I didn't think I was depressed. I'm still not sure if I am since I only have these thoughts sometimes when I'm lying in bed trying to fall asleep and then I just cry until I wake up the next morning. Most of the time though I just live day to day and try not to think about these things. But sometimes, like tonight, these thoughts creep in and I'm thinking of how pathetic and pointless my life has been so far. I just wish I can find something to live for so that I can work towards it.
