Not even relationship wise, but i feel as if there is nobody who would just genuinely care about you in this fake society. The only person i can ever rely on is myself. I try to vent to my friends but they either just get annoyed or dont care. I always have fantasies about just meeting someone and them making my world feel better. Idk just a little rant from me
