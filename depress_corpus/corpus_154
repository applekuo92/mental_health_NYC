Thoughts like these creep into my mind every now and then, and they always make me feel more like shit than I was already. I feel like I should be proactive and try to fix myself, but I have no idea what to do or how to do it. Everything's just so difficult...

Not looking for advice, just wanted to share.

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, guys! It's great to know I'm not alone.
