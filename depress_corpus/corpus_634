I've tried so hard to tell myself that if I keep trying and keep taking chances, it'll get better. I know objectively that life changes so much so quickly, it just has to improve someday, right? Especially so if I really put myself out there and earn some opportunities. 

So what exactly do I do when it never gets better? When I take a chance and it blows up on me, leaving me wishing I hadn't done anything in the first place? 

When I really try my best to do something cool, since y'know I've been stuck in a depressive slump and I want to get out of it right? Then it turns out to just waste my time, other people's time and put my ineptitude on display. Why should I have even bothered? I feel worse than before.

So sure, it'll get better. But I am really fucking tired of waking up to another long day when it's bad and it only looks worse from here on out.
