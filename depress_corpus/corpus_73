I'm posting this here because I don't really know where else to put it. I noticed the sidebar link to SuicideWatch, but it didn't feel right to start a thread there among all the other people who really need help. 

Since I was a teenager I've had "casual" suicidal thoughts. I don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when I say that, I literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go "I made a small mistake at work today, I should just drive into that concrete barrier" Or I'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching TV or something, and think "you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head." I don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. And what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like "yeah, I guess that /is/ an option!"

This has been normal for me for so long, every day for years, but recently I've been thinking about how fucked up it is. And I feel alone because it's like you can't tell anybody about it or else they'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode. 

I just had to get this off my chest. It's difficult to have these cavalier thoughts and feel like a freak on top of keeping a lid on the depression/anxiety/"imposter syndrome" to seem normal every day.
