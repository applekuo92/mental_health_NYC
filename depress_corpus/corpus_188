I don't have anyone to tell, but I feel kind of accomplished. And like a disgusting loser at the same time. I showered, washed my hair, dried off with clean towels, and got dressed into clean clothes. I even put a goddamn bra on! 

It's been a really rough few weeks. I basically never leave my flat (apartment) anyway, but I haven't even been able to answer the door at all, even to family or like, delivery people. 

I know that people would read this and think, "Jesus H., I could never go *one* day without showering, that's gross!" But I wasn't always this unwell. I used to go to college and work, and I'd shower every day. I stopped working in 2004 and I've relied on disability benefits ever since. It's something of which I'm incredibly ashamed. I didn't become this repulsive, reclusive loser over night. It's been 10+ years of surviving day-to-day as best I can. Sometimes my best is well below par, and I don't eat, I sleep 12 hours a day, I don't see or speak to anyone, I don't wash properly. My dad is massively supportive and helps me any way he can (leaving bags of groceries by my front door etc.), but things like bathing and eating... only I can tackle those challenges.

tl;dr I did a normal daily life human thing. Yay?

**EDIT**: Wow, I'm completely blown away by how kind and thoughtful you've all been... reading all the messages this morning made me cry, I was so filled up with your positivity! Honestly, I was half expecting a few less-than-kind responses calling me a Josie Grossie(!), but I'm overwhelmed by how understanding and compassionate you all are.  It's heartbreaking that so many can identify with the self-care struggle, but... baby steps. No matter how small or trivial the achievement, a win is a win :) Sorry I haven't replied to everyone...
