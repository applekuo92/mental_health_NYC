Hi, /r/depression! I've decided over a long period of believing that nobody cares or listens about what I think or feel, that I'll try the Internet. Maybe it'll work, I don't know. Maybe it will just be like every other experience I've had. Anything's better than talking to an imaginary friend in bed at night while crying (yes, I'm that desperate).

This post might get long and tangent-y but hang in there. I'm Ethan. I'm 12. I have no real friends, ADHD, mood disorder and ASD (seriously, that shit isn't self diagnosed). My parents have fought with each other ever since I can remember, and they got divorced last year. I've been bullied since preschool, and at this point I don't think any person in the school gives a shit because nobody will listen. I *was* obsessed with technology and coding, until my parents took that away because they thought I was addicted and it was making me sad (I'm writing this while sneaking a computer, because I'm desperate for somebody to talk to). Really, the fact was, everything else *but* technology made me sad. That was the problem. Not technology, but the stuff that happened around it. More recently, my mom and I have been getting in huge fights that have ended in violence from both sides, and she never recognizes that she does anything wrong. It's always my fault, all of the time. She tells me "you ruin everything" like at least 10 times a week. She brings my sister who beats me up when nobody watches that they never punish to karaoke without me because I'll "ruin it." Then she calls me at my dad's house and says that she wants to have a good relationship with me but *I* need to change. Its like she doesn't even realize that she hurts me. When I ask her if she realizes she hurts me, she says "yes", but when I ask her what she does to hurt me, she says "zilch". School is even worse, because its full of kids who tell me I'm weird, mean, and retarded, followed by laughing with their friends. Kids say that bullying is horrible, but sometimes they don't even realize **that *they* are being the bully.** They get sad when something like [Amanda Todd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Amanda_Todd) happens, but they only give a shit until she dies. They don't give a shit about the (at least) thousands of other depressed teenagers who are depressed. ***BUT!*** THEY TOTALLY CARE ABOUT AMANDA TODD OH NO IT WAS HORRIBLE!

Anyway, I probably seem like any other emo teenager who complains about how "horrible" their life is, but I never said my life is horrible. There is a big difference between "hard" and "horrible." I have no plans of suicide, because I don't want to let a shitty childhood ruin the rest of my life.


**edit:** I'm not sure why people downvoted this. I guess I'm right. Not even the /r/depression gives a shit. I am worthless. Fuck, there goes talking to the Internet. One less person to talk to.

**edit 2:** MORE DOWNVOTES? Seriously, it just gets worse and worse for me here.

**edit FUCKING AMAZING CRAZY COOL NUMBER YO:** I'm SO glad to see all of the comments, I'm just reading them now, thank you all so much! I'll reply to as many as I can in a few hours. I'll be up all night!
