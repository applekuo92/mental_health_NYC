To all the submitters of /r/depression, even if you don't get comments or PMs or some sort of sign that someone's read your piece, don't delete it, don't be ashamed, don't feel lonely, don't regret it.

On nights like the ones I have now, it makes me feel less alone if I know there are others who feel as I do. I'd give you my words and thoughts if I could, but I'm a tongue-tied twat half the time and I'd end up (unintentionally) saying something that's the opposite of helpful.

Thank you for posting, all of you. Thank you for posting your rants, your acheivements, your thoughts and your day to day and everything you let me and the rest of us read. It gives me motivation and perspective and most of all, it makes me feel less alone. Please keep posting, and please keep trying. 

You all deserve the best.
