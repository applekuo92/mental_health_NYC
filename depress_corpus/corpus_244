This kind of depressing thought came to me today and I can't shake it off. I'm in grad school and at this point completely financially supported by my parents (living independently though) but I don't have motivation to do basic things like cooking and cleaning (I eat out or make premade dinners. My room's pretty gross, not hoarder levels of gross, like I throw out food containers and whatnot, just laundry and clutter everywhere. I'm embaressed whenever I accidently leave the door open.) My sleep habits and diet are terrible, and I barely have the motivation to get out of bed some days. I skip lab/class usually once a week. I know all the things that are messed up in my life, but don't have the motivation for some relatively simple fixes either, or I get bursts of motivation where I do the things I'm responsible for (and pretty damn well IMO) but I can't keep it up for more than a week at most before regressing into missing more school.

I was thinking, if my parents wouldn't/couldn't support me, I'd have to get a 9-5 job that I'd need to consistantly be at every day. If I can't manage having the energy to go to school every day, which is considerably less intensive than work (and not necessarily 8 hours) how will I keep a steady job which is so much more exerting? If I can't keep a job, and I don't have motivation to improve the small easy things in my life, how am I going to cope when I have no money, and then no place to live? I honestly think the only motivation that would keep me off the streets is my fixation on playing video games...

I really am scared for the day my parents give up on me and I truly need to face myself, alone.
