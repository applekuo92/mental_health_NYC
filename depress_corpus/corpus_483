I'm living in a constant spiral of self-hatred and failure. The only thing I can successfully do is be a complete asshole to everyone around me. The stress I live in is somehow continuing to kill something that died long ago. Nothing matters to me, yet everything around me can set me off. I can't even talk to people without putting up fronts to cover the hundreds that have already been worn out. The mere concept of continuing to exist shakes me to my core and causes me to shut down.

But hey, at least I'm passing my classes. That's all that matters, right? *Right*?
