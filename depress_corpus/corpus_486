When Frodo says: "I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened." Gandalf responds with: "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us." I've been where Frodo was so many times, wishing I hadn't done something or that I had done something different. You know the "if only I" or "I should've" moments where we are living in the past. I find at least a little hope in what Gamdalf says. Maybe I can change my future for the better if I choose to correctly use the time that is given. I don't know, I might be full of shit too.
