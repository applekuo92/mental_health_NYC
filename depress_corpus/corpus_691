It is the best time of the day, because even though most of my dreams are nightmares there is still more feeling in them than I get in a normal day. It also is safe, and comforting. People might hate and judge you for not working hard enough, but everyone needs sleep. 

Unfortunately, it is also the worst time of day because I have to wake up and face my fears as a new day begins.
