I struggle with this idea a lot.  I'm not sure what I want in my life. I'm a year away from finishing a business degree and am fairly well set up to get a decent paying job once I graduate. But I am not passionate about the work I do and it makes going to work unbearable. 

I keep telling myself that I need to find something I am passionate about for me to not feel so lost all the time, but I have so many things I am kind of interested in but nothing that I truly feel passionate about. I thought I had more to say, but I'm sure some of you know how that goes...
