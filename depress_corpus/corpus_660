Dear friends and family,

By some weird error I managed to live past my expiration date. I should of killed myself long ago. I'm so sorry [sister]. I love you. [Ex], you broke my heart. Why? 

Well goodbye everyone.

This was from like two years ago. After I made the not I sat in my room for a while and called suicide hotline and they managed to talk me out of it and then I stashed my journal away and I forgot about it until this post. I'm fine by the way it's just weird seeing something that isn't me anymore.
