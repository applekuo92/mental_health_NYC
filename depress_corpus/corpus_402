I was taking a walk and had about 20 minutes of no cars or people. I started pretending like it was the zombie apocalypse and somehow it made me feel better. I came up with this list as I finished my walk.


Ten reasons why a zombie apocalypse would be awesome for depressed people:


1) You can shoot any zombie that ever told you pre-apocalypse to "cheer up" or "get over it."

2) Your feelings of isolation and being alone are even more valid. 

3) No more expensive psych meds - pillage all pharmacies.

4) Staying in bed four days in a row is a good idea and potentially life saving.

5) Fewer awkward social interactions. Possibly no social interactions.

6) Zombies far less judgmental than real people.

7) Forever alone doesn't feel like your fault anymore.

8) Fewer options and need to re-populate possibly means never alone again.

9) "Normal" survivors might finally experience clinical depression and understand.

10) If you really, really hate it, you can always become a zombie.
