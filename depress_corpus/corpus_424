Is this common for anyone else? Or vice versa for girls? 

I just know I will never talk to them or have any connection with them. I also started a new job recently and I hate hearing everyone talk about their significant other while I have no one. It seems like such a trivial thing to be sad over but I just want some affection. 

:(
