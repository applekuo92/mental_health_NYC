I wish I knew who to talk to, if I had anyone to talk to at all. A lot of the time, I'm too anxious to know what to do, and too worried to share my opinion or talk in public. I've gotten more irritable, and I hate it. 

At the same time, I wish I knew what I could do. How do you even make friends anymore? What do you do after you meet people?
