Flossing is one of those menial tasks that manages to elude the vast majority of people. Whether it's mere forgetfulness or pure apathy towards dental hygiene -- it's pretty obvious that most people neglect this very basic routine.

What does this have to do with clinical depression, you might ask? Well, one of the perpetual characteristic negative thought cycles in our depressed brain is that of inadequacy. We never think we are 'enough' -- be it in our school work, career, social life, or what have you. We like to think that we are 'subpar', 'below average', etc.

By engaging in the simple act of flossing, I am better than the overwhelming majority of people out there. I am doing something that puts me in a small percentage of the population that takes its dental hygiene seriously. It's even something that I can brag about the next time I visit a dentist: "Yea, I floss; and I'm DAMN PROUD of it."

It does seem rather silly to be so proud of such a small thing. Yet, big successes are built on small ones. Maybe next time I see that cute girl at Starbucks I'll smile and show off my awesome pearly whites! Maybe my dental epiphany will inspire you to find that one little thing you absolutely ROCK at!
