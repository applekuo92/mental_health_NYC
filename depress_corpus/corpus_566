I'm a 17 year old male and I'm romantically and sexually attracted to boys ages 8-12 (also normal aged guys mostly boys...)

Lately my lack of friends is making a larger void in my life that is often filled with the desire to be with a boy. 

I'm so disgusted with myself even though I've never and will never do anything to a boy. I really just wish i could make the thoughts go away but I can't and lately its seeming suicide is the only way to quiet my mind. 

I just really can't do this anymore.
