I attempted to hang myself by tying a belt to my bed frame.  It started almost as an impulsive decision. "Stop fucking around with the idea and do it already" were the kind of though in my head.  I stopped it as soon as I started to pass out and "realized" that I would die if I lost consciousness.  I cried, for a while, and I started thinking that I would have to put my life goals on hold, just to focus on not killing myself.  When I had that thought the noose I had made looked awfully inviting.  Instead I called someone who I love and who seems to love me unconditionally.  It was hard to admit to her what I'd done.  I begged her for forgiveness before I could even tell her.  

I'm glad I called her.  I'm glad I didn't kill myself.  I'm going to go eat chocolate because being alive means I get to eat chocolate.  

I'm in a very weird place right now.  I'm only ~2 hours from the attempt.  I hope that before anyone else commits suicide they call someone they love.  I could be dead right now.  I could have been dead by 20 seconds. but I'm not I'm here I'm alive and I'm going to eat some chocolate.
