So, I have a very shy and awkward type of personality, and I've always been this way for most of my life. And I gotta tell you, I HATE MY PERSONALITY WITH EVERY INCH OF MY BODY. I cannot shake it off no matter how hard I try, and now I'm giving up. I have practically no friends, I don't belong anywhere, Nailing a job interview is impossible, Girls of course don't seem to particularly like me, and I just don't get much respect from anyone, and its NOT like I'm a shady ugly character or anything. Im tall, I have a somewhat athletic build, I have nice hair, I have everything physically to be a typical popular jock, BUT MY GODDAMN PERSONALITY IS MY FATAL FLAW. ITS ACTUALLY BEEN 5 MONTHS SINCE IVE ACTUALLY HELD A PROPER CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. Seriously! Im starting to go crazy, I'm actually starting to talk to myself now. I came here because I just wanted to hear someone's voice, even if its just through an internet forum, because I'm incapable of communicating in real life. 


Im in this horrible position when I see some of my old classmates having a blast with massive friend groups, parties, relationships, trips, events, the time of their lives. While I'm here staring at the ceiling wishing for god to stop my heart and remove MISFITS like myself from this earth and put all of us out of our misery. I think I'm actually gonna go for it, I'm going to kill myself soon, and I just wanted to post this so that I guess someone on this site would know. In the future I hope there is a way to detect mental deficiencies such as shyness and awkwardness in the womb before we are born, so that the defective humans like myself can be aborted before we are ever born to suffer in this world which we are engineered to fail in.
