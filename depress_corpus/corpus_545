Ive been depressed for years and telling myself I didn't need pills.

I coped with alcohol, I drank 300$+ a month in beer. I no showed for work, I didn't pay my bills on time, I was always broke.

My mom always convinced me pills were for weak people, my anxiety has only been more and more crippling for months.

A few weeks ago I was prescribed venlafaxine 37.5. no suicidal thoughts, no anxiety. For the first time in a long time I feel in control of my life, I'm paying my bills, I am working a good job I like, quit drinking and smoking, and I'm feeling better than I have in a year+.

It's okay to get help, not every problem you can handle on your own.

**EDIT:** Thank each and every one of you kind souls for the upvotes and support. It makes me feel even better. I've been trying to reply to everyone but there's just a lot especially on my phone. I wish you all the best of luck in your adventures and escapades too, and I hope we can all find solace one day.
