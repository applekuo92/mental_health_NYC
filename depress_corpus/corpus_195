Like if your depression isn't a 10 on a scale from 1 to 10, then you must be a lazy asshole who's looking for excuses? I feel like this whenever my depression subsides a bit (especially since starting a new, effective medication) - I will read some posts here and start to think "I don't belong here. What am I doing here? These people are *actually* depressed. This person has attempted suicide several times. That person had a really rough childhood. That other person feels so bad that they can't get out of bed in the morning. And me? My life seems pretty okay compared to all of them. I just need to get my shit together and stop making excuses." ... followed by feelings of guilt and worthlessness.

Are these thoughts normal with depression?
