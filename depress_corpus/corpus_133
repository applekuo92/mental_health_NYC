LIFE HACKS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS

Hello, it has been with some interest that I have read many articles on this topic on a variety of websites. All of the advice I have viewed has been helpful.
I have suffered with both depression and anxiety and I thought I might share some of the stuff I have found useful over the past 15 years.

Some of the points I will make have been made by others and published on the net, but they do bear repeating as they are practical and have utility, others I haven’t seen in print before. 

When unwell I experience a state where even showering, preparing food, answering the phone or checking the mail is actually traumatic – so, when sick, I avoid these activities. Generally this only worsens my situation, so I developed a number of hacks to assist myself. I hope some people find these helpful.

Often when we are depressed, anxious  or paranoid our brains sink into negativity and utilize catastrophic thinking which can be overwhelming and further reinforces and maintains the distress we experience. This can be further worsened when basic duties like washing up, caring for yourself etc. go by the wayside.

If you are not familiar with Maslow’s pyramid I would recommend you Google it and have a basic understanding of the principles as a lot of the advice I will give will make more sense if you do.


EATING:

In depression it is common for simple tasks to be overwhelming and for appetite to be diminished. This is, perhaps, an evolutionary by-product where the body senses it has lost equilibrium and from its “point of view” sensibly drops your appetite so energy can go into the immune system or the flight and flight response. This reflex is great if you have the flu or you need to run away from a zombie, it is not at all helpful in depression or anxiety or the negative syndrome of schizophrenia. Ever single neurotransmitter in our brains that is used to maintain mood and assist us to deal with distress comes from substrates in our diet. We cannot manufacture serotonin, noradrenaline or dopamine without precursors from our diet. Currently almost all anti-depressants and anti-psychotics work by essentially making your natural store of these chemicals work longer and harder, usually by blocking their destruction or re-uptake back into the brain cells or by altering the sites where these molecules work. So it is important to keep up some basic nutrition and regular meals. Psychologically it is also a powerful message to your brain (whether the conscious or unconscious aspects) that you are capable of looking after your survival needs and at some level will improve your self esteem and trust in yourself that even when faced with adversity your have the inner resilience to look after yourself. There is an American study in which they took fit, young mentally stable people with no history of mental illness and starved them. Almost all met criteria for major depression, most also met criteria for anxiety problems and a disturbing number were suicidal by the end of the study. So please continue to eat well.

1.	Pack your pantry and freezer with healthy easy to prepare meals. Always go for the least processed option and try to avoid white sugar and especially white flour. Soups, baked beans etc are a good start but I’ll let you generate your own list. The priorities here are to get stuff that is non-perishable, easy to prepare with a minimum of effort and provides decent nutrition.
2.	Have an emergency supply that will last at least a week that you don’t use unless you have to, so if your mental health does decompensate you are stocked up.
3.	Get yourself a supply of Paper plates, bowls, baking dishes, and cutlery. Biodegradable products are freely available and the ones made out of strengthen paper can be reused if not soiled. This allows you to eat with some dignity without having to worry about the washing up as you can dispose of everything afterwards. This is not optimal for the environment but we are looking at temporary hacks while you are unwell.
4.	Likewise purchase disposal oven baking trays. Aluminum is fine but the biodegradable reinforced paper ones are best as come with plastic lids so cooked food can be placed straight into the refrigerator once cool. 
5.	Have one of those heavy plastic under-the-bed storage boxes that can fix nicely in a cupboard under the sink or on the kitchen bench. Half fill it with water, detergent and salt. Deposit everything that cannot be thrown into the waste in it after a general rinse to remove food. This soaking will remove all grease etc. and with a lid will not invite bugs/flies/mold or smell.
6.	When full, fill your sink with water deposit the items in it. Rinse and then allow to dry. This way there are never any used dishes around your house or filling up your sink to lower your self esteem further and if surprise people should visit the place continues to look reasonably ok.
7.	Supplements such as a multi-vitamin, high dose fish oil and a multi B vitamin all have some evidence and worth considering if your diet is insufficient.
8.	Protein shakes make a great meal if you cannot stomach the idea of eating solid food. Ensure you get one with soluble fiber and a good amino-acid profile. As you want to limit the amount of effort and cleaning required purchase a product that readily dissolves when simply shaken or stirred so no mixing device is required.
9.	This way keeping a clean and ordered kitchen should only require about ten minutes effort about once a week if you live by yourself.

CLOTHES

There is something quite disheartening, when your self-esteem is crap, to have to go out and the only clean clothes you have are a mismatched outfit, while everything else you own is littered around your house on the floor. Go out of your way to buy clothes that don’t need to be dry-cleaned or ironed.

First things first, you want to divide your clothes into three groups. Almost everyone regardless of their coloring looks good in dark colors; the black and grey spectrum. Likewise most people look good in the white/light colour spectrum. I am paler than an albino polar bear so warm colours like red/orange/yellow make me look and feel like a weeping sore while I do look good in the cold spectrum of green/blue/purple. Decide which colour spectrum really suits you. Ask for advice if you are unsure. 

Rearrange your clothes cupboard along these colour lines. If you don’t have a lot of space or money then buying cheap but sturdy boxes from a storage place then tape them together so they function like a multi level cupboard and cover with a nice sheet or decorative throw.

Put all of your white underpants/socks/t-shirts and causal pants in one box. Fill another with your darks and another with your colours.

Hang up all your shirts, coats, jumpers and pants etc etc grouped by colour in your wardrobe.

The aim here is to ensure that when you wear an outfit EVERYTHING you have on can be washed together.

At the end of the day, instead of throwing everything into your dirty linen basket or on the floor just deposit everything into the washing machine directly. Continue to choose items from the same colour grouping until the washing machine is full. Then throw in the cleaning products and press the button. This way there is never any dirty clothes lying around the house or sitting unwashed, getting smelly, in a basket. It also eliminates the task of separating whites from darks etc. and limits the need to do multiple loads.

Then just throw them in the dryer. For one person this should mean that you only need to do one to two loads of washing a week and you already have an organized system of boxes to put the dry clothes away. This should take up about 30- 45 minutes of work a week. It also relieves you of having to look at mess that will further lower your mood. It will also give a powerful message to your brain that even if you are depressed you can still get things done. Not to mention, looking at increasing mounds of dirty clothes can overwhelm you with the prospect of work, which can make it, more unlikely you will clean.

Use this same principle with your Manchester.

BUY IN BULK AND STOCK PILE.

They is no greater insult to feeling good then running out of toilet paper, and when depressed it can be insurmountable to get dressed and go to the shops to buy stuff while at the same time you are hating on yourself for running out. If you use a bit of smarts you can stockpile essentials with little cost.

Parents/ friends/charities etc for a 30-50 voucher for shopping. If they are concerned you might waste the money advise them to buy vouchers that cannot be spent on alcohol or cigarettes.

Buy enough of the following to last a month, at least:
•	Toilet paper
•	Tooth paste
•	Soap
•	Deodorant
•	Shaving cream and razors
•	Shampoo and conditioner – but there are great ways to make your own.
•	General cleaning products
•	Laundry products.
Then every time you are able to go shopping only ever buy these items when on sale.  Buy these even if you have an oversupply. It is often ridiculous how cheap these items can be when on sale or a new product is available and they want to promote it.

If you don’t have storage for these products get some boxes for free from shopping outlets  (at time of writing Bunnings and Dan Murphy’s generally have an oversupply of boxes for the public) and store them under sofas, beds, or in the back of cupboards. You will never run out of essentials again.

STOP ALL UNWANTED phone calls/visits and mail.

Get a sign for your mailbox stating no unsolicited or junk mail. Cannot afford one? Create one on a public library computer, print it off and get them to laminate it. It should only cost a couple of dollars.

Do the exact same thing for your front door. Make it polite and simple. “No visitors requesting charity/money/surveys/ promoting politics, religion etc. 

Place your phone number on the “no-call” list for surveys/sales/insurance etc. If you have a mobile phone then use it, if possible, as your only point of contact for family/friends/health care providers/work and turn off voice mail and activate the mechanism where every voice message has to be transferred into text. Anyone who rings you for something unimportant won’t bother leaving a message and if someone does it is often less intimidating, when you are consumed with anxiety, to read a text then listen to a message.

RESEARCH METHODS ON HOW TO KEEP YOUR PLACE CLEAN WITH MINIMAL EFFORT.

I won’t detail ever hack here as there is so much great info out there but I’ll list some things I have found very helpful.

If, like me, you find yourself essentially living on the couch or your bed when unwell then you will be familiar at how disorganized and dirty these areas can become when you eat, smoke etc etc in the same local for days at a time. 

For any area you normally snuggle and remain in for a while get some ultra cheap bath mats or even single bed sheets from a second hand store. You can usually get these for a few bucks. Place them on the floor so it completely surrounds the area. This way you won’t need to vacuum or worry about crumps etc. When you have the energy and it is getting dirty. Lift it up by its corners so all debris is safely caught and shake it outside. If possible have more than one for each area so if you do ruin it you can just throw the entire thing out and still have a spare.

Buy one of those streak free no scrub shower products. Every time you have a shower spray everything at the end. The next time you shower the entire place will sparkle with NO EFFORT. Do this at the end of every shower.

We all have socks that we need to get rid of. Don’t. Every morning after your shower drop a bit of floor cleaner or eucalyptus oil on the floor and go over the bathroom floor while wearing your “cleaning socks”. Don’t have any? Buy them for a dollar at a cheap or second hand stop. Every morning squirt the toilet bowl with a toilet cleaner and just leave it until the next time you use it. This way your bathroom should generally be presentable and clean. This is very mood lifting when you need to use it and a big comfort if someone drops round. Most people will forgive a messy house but expect the silent judgment treatment if they need to use your bathroom and it resembles something at a truck stop. This should take an extra five minutes of work a day.

After coming out of a very severe bout of depression I was ashamed at how filthy my place was. Get a bin for every single room you frequently use. Plastic shopping bags are free and work just great. Have one everywhere hanging on a door knob or the edge of furniture. When you don’t have the motivation to get off the couch your waste can be put in the bag and when you do have five minutes of energy instead of having to pick up a whole lot of junk from the floors throughout your place or vacuum you only need to collect all the bags and place in the council pick up bin. Voila in five minutes there are no empty packages of food, ciggie boxes, milk bottles etc. littered throughout your apartment.

DO SOMETHING EVERY SINGLE DAY

Every day do at least one thing from the following list:
•	Something for pleasure that does not involve drugs/alcohol or anything else dangerous to your mood. On days where everything is “too hard” then this might just be re-watching a favourite TV show or movie or listening to the radio, on other days go for a walk etc. etc. I won’t give a list. You know what you like, I don’t
•	Do a duty. This is stuff that might not be fun but has to be done. Always set this task to your level of motivation and energy. If you are consumed with distress and overwhelmed then just pick a single fork from your dishes, waiting to be washed, and wash and dry it and put in the draw.
•	Link up with someone who genueilly cares for you. If you don’t have the energy to talk, then send a text or a Facebook message or email or something similar. Write a card and send it. But stay connected. If you have no energy then write it in such a way to dis-invite an immediate return phone call or follow up texts. It is OK to stretch the truth – although I never recommend lying as it sets up damaging programs in your subconscious. “Hi just texting to say I love you/ thinking of you/ hope you and your family are going well etc etc. I’m about to collapse into bed speak soon”. Obviously if you are in a more powerful or confident state then actually do ring someone. If you don’t feel you have any friends or family then join an internet chat room for people with mental illness that is well moderated (Beyond Blue is the best site, in my opinion) and just chat to a stranger – you never know this may develop into an internet friendship that continues to bring much into your life.

The purposes of these actions are multiple. One of the reasons for adopting such a structure is that it can utilize as little as five minutes with minimal energy but feeds a powerful message that you still are a capable person who can get things moving towards full functioning – YES even if you just wash a spoon. Setting yourself tasks and completing them is essentially the only way to genuinely improve your confidence and skill level. Even if you need to start small…. every journey start with the first single step. Always congratulate yourself for every single task you achieve – no matter how small.


IF ON MEDICATION

Do not run out. Most pharmacies will allow you to purchase more than one script at a time if you explain to them that you won’t be able to get back in time to refill your next one.  Ask your doctor for some sample packs with your scripts. Save these. So if you find yourself in the situation that your meds have run out and you are too unwell to go to the doctor or pharmacy you have backups. A lot of pharmacies will happily keep your scripts on file and for a small fee send out your meds when you are getting low – especially online businesses.


FOR WHEN VISITORS INSIST ON COMING OVER

If you have put in place the “bin in every room hack then all it takes is about 3 minutes to collect and deposit all of them in the council bin. Your house may need vacuuming or dusting but it won’t be littered with rubbish. Have some cheap but pleasant incense or aerosol / spray bottle essential oils to remove that “lived in” aroma within seconds. 

 Have an emergency box for visitors. Don’t use the contents unless you absolutely must and if so replace them. It can be awkward and embarrassing when people drop by and you have to basically tell them “sorry I have nothing to offer you”.

What I have in my box?

•	Samples of good quality tea both normal and herbal. These can often be picked up at hospitals/hotels etc or when round at your parents or friends comment that the tea they served was fantastic and would it be ok to take two or three bags. If they are foil sealed wonderful. If not cover in foil or put in zip lock bag.
•	Smallest bottle possible of a decent instant coffee.
•	Long life milk/unrefrigerated soy or nut milk.
•	Sugar and artificial sweetener samples. These can often be picked up at any coffee shop or eatery for free.
•	A nice teacup with saucer and a clean coffee mug (so you don’t have to scramble to clean anything).
•	A packet of decent biscuits
•	Two or three cans of beer (This is for visitors)
•	Frozen chips and finger food that can be heated within 15 minutes in the oven in your disposable oven tray and served up in a disposable bowl.
•	Another winner is to have a packet of corn chips, jar of salsa and shredded cheese (stored in the freezer). Bang it all together on a large disposal plate pop in microwave and within three minutes – simple but delicious nachos.
•	Microwavable popcorn.
This way if someone does drop by you are ALWAYS in a position to offer him or her a snack and a drink. I am sure you will be able to create a selection that would suit your friends and family. Don’t spend too much and keep it simple.

OH GOD OH GOD IT IS SOMEONE’s birthday/anniversary etc.

It is not uncommon for these things to sneak up on you when all your energy is going into keeping your head above water. Again those two-dollar shops are a lifesaver.
In this box I generally have:
•	A number of blank cards – so I can use them for any situation. Pictures of beautiful scenery or cute animals generally cover any situation and can be picked up for about a dollar.
•	Wrapping paper – again buy on special or after a holiday event has passed and shops are selling Xmas paper at about 90% off. No one is going to mind if their birthday present is wrapped in green and red.
•	A mix of cheap but useful gifts. It is difficult to offer advice here as everyone has different people with different tastes in their life. No one wants a box of chocolates or socks though.
•	I keep a cheap but really delicious red and white wine bottle. (ask around and talk to alcohol shop assistants)
•	Handmade soap from markets
•	Some scratch lottery tickets (the one dollar kind)
•	Some stamps
•	Some nice stationary.

This way you always have on hand the ability to send a card to someone, maybe slip in a scratchie, or write a letter on nice stationary about how much you value them (often more meaningful than any present). And if you need to go to a party you have a bottle of wine some nice soap and whatever else you have on hand to use as a gift.

Other useful gifts could be good balsamic vinegar or make your own garlic or chili infused olive oil in a decorative bottle from a two-dollar shop.  None of these go out of date and can save your bacon when you are under pressure.

GROOMING

Boy doesn’t this go by the wayside when depression hits. I’m the unlucky type of person that if I don’t clean my face twice a day I break out – and I’m in my forties! Also if I go more than three days without washing my hair I get big globs of dandruff.

•	Get a pot/package of disposal face wipes and keep in your bedroom and lounge room – placed discretely away in a draw. Experimentation will demonstrate which one works best for you. Even though I have very sensitive skin the Clearasil one is fantastic for me – but it is pricey. I always stock up when it is on special. You can also make your own (recipes on the net) but make sure you put in a decent antibacterial preservative. Tea Tree oil is great. When I don’t have the energy or motivation to shower I use these twice a day and have never had a breakout no matter how long I don’t shower.
•	If you need to go out or someone drops by your skin always looks clean and clear.
•	Waterless shampoo marketed for campers is sort of OK.
•	A great way to get rid of dandruff in one shower is to mix your shampoo 50/50 with baking soda, leave on for a few minutes then rewash in plain shampoo. My hair looks great even though it was dull and lifeless five minutes previously.
•	Either make your own or buy cheap antibacterial mouthwash. Have one in the kitchen, laundry and bathroom. If you can’t be bothered brushing your teeth (which is ALWAYS the best option) at least you can destroy all the tartar bacteria and clean your breath in seconds and it is better than doing nothing.
•	If you cannot get out of bed some body wipes are great for the armpits. You might not be cleaning your whole body but will significantly decrease your personal smell, which is good on many, many levels – especially if you get guests or need to go out.

If you don’t regularly clean your body bacteria and skin debris can build up and weaken the skin, so a daily shower is always the best option but an antibacterial body moisturizer can keep your skin looking supple and kill off fungus/bacteria. Just buy a dirt-cheap sorbolene cream and add some tea tree oil to it. Stress areas such as elbows, knees, hands and feet can be covered in about a minute and you will feel and look better for it.

I have an enormous list of other hacks that are useful in mental illness, especially on pet and garden care, and how to maintain friendships and family connections when all you want to do is crawl into bed and not communicate with anyone, which I will type up for another article if this one proves helpful.

There is obviously no decent substitute for proper eating, cleaning, washing and grooming – but as people with mental illness know often it is impossible or extremely challenging to keep up with normal duties. I hope some of these hacks are helpful for some people. I have no doubt that not all of them will be suitable or appropriate for everyone and of course each could be criticized on some level. The purpose of this article is not to promote laziness or habitual behavior but to offer suggestions on how to cope and function at a higher level (even if only marginally) then just being curled up in bed and doing nothing. Mental illness is often not curable but it is very treatable. These tips are intended simply as a stepping-stone on the way back to wellbeing and better functioning.
