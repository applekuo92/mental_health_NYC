I don't like that I'm depressed, antisocial and lonely. People at work ask me to hang out with them, but they usually go to a bar, and as an alcoholic I don't want to be there. Even if it's something like board games, I feel tired all the time and I don't have energy to talk to anyone. Every day I just wait until I can go home and spend the evening lying on my bed with the laptop. It's a downward spiral.
