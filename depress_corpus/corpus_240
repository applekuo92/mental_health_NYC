I've been going through a rough patch recently, having struggled with severe bouts of depression for the past 10 years. I haven't been the person I want to be- I just want to be happy and less complicated but sometimes it is hard. I finally opened up to my boyfriend since I felt my sadness had taken a toll on our relationship. I told him that I know I have no reason to be sad, that I live in a nice area of the world and realize how lucky I am in many ways.

He told me he sent me a book that would make me feel better- I get the book and it is a story about a family who is killed in a concentration camp during World War Two. I was really confused, at first I honestly thought it was a mistake that he sent it. I asked what his intentions were and he told me that he was coming from a good place, and wanted me to realize how good I have it. I told him that I understand that his intentions were good, but that I felt his selection was a little off base. Just because I am depressed doesn't mean I am not thankful for my life and that I am ignorant to the plight of others. He told me that I was negative and that he was sick of me. We are no longer together. Trying to reconcile this right now. Feeling like a horrible person but knowing I had a reason to feel the way I felt about what happened.
