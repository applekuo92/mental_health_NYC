the only phone notifications you get are from game apps you haven't played in a while, or texts from your carrier about data usage and minutes. When I got that notification today, I couldn't help but just let out a laugh at just how absurd my life is right now. Guess you just gotta find the dark humor in these pathetic moments of realization.
