So this guy (he has a gf, Im closeted bi/gay/whatever male) has recently been super nice to me. He is buying one of those hairless rats and he is explaining to me all the stuff about its care. He is a really nice guy and although we have never hanged out together he is very outgoing and open with everyone (it seems) and Im the opossite. He likes rap a lot and I like some like Death cab for cutie. 

Its not the first time I feel like this, really liking a friend, just because they start talking a lot to me and stuff. He has invited me to go see his rat someday and Im really excited about it.

In the past I lost my best friend in similar circumstances. I loved him, but I couldnt bear that he didnt love me. This has happened two other times not long ago, and I am in the process of stopping those, but a third one arises.

Am I the only one? What is this? This sounds like its named xxxx's Syndrome. I need helo with this.
