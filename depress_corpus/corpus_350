Hello everyone, I really don't know how to put it so I'll come out and say it. My life is a mess, I really do want to die but I don't have the desire...or the guts to commit suicide. I've lost all my friends, school doesn't interest me at all, nothing seems fun or worthwhile anymore, my girlfriend left me a year ago this month and my dream job is out of reach. I feel cynical about everything and I hate the world I can't even find happiness with my family because they all either shoot down my hopes and dreams or are constantly fighting with one another over stupid things. I want to stress that I have not and do not intend to hurt myself in anyway but I truly wish I died in some way, a car crash, cancer, a mugging gone wrong. I feel like I have complete disregard for my own life now. I even walk down the worst neighbourhoods at night, alone, hoping something would happen. I keep telling myself if I don't die or reach my dream I should just fly to France and enlist in the French Foreign Legion...It looks like all my options are gone now. Please comment open and honestly but respectfully on what i should do. Thank you all for reading and hearing me out where others in my life have not.
