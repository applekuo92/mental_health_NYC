This weekend I got a kitty from my mom! I think it's the best. I haven't gotten much negative thoughts or want to do anything bad to myself. Even though I do feel depressed sometimes this kitty just comes cuddle by me and just brighten my day. Guess it good to have a companion. :) 

Edit: Sorry here's pics! Her name Zelda (:

She has a little deform ear, but that makes her special: http://imgur.com/XWXDpHg
