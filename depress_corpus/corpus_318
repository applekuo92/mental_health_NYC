I need to prove my dad wrong, I need to show him that I can get an education, get a kickass job and most of all: Be happier and more kind/tolerant than he'll ever be! I'll make people feel welcome, not like they're absolute failures (Nice way to raise kids btw dad, you fucking prick) He never believed that my depression is a real thing, he just said to my face that I was doomed from birth, because "I've always been a little shit" But screw him! I have finally let go of the mental chains he put on me, I'll show him. So thanks dad for giving me strength without trying to, but fuck you for making my childhood miserable. I won't attend your funeral. Also, I'll show you just how much love I can give my future wife and children, because you fucking suck at it. To everyone here: Thanks for reading my wall, the support from this sub has really helped me in hard times when I had no one to turn to :) you're amazing people.
