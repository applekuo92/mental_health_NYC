It's not like I do it on purpose, but...my depression is eating me alive.

Edit: I'm so sorry to hear that a lot of you are going through/went through what I'm going through right now. It's a shitty path and it's getting tougher with time.

(Replying to all of you now.)

A little background on me: I am a 19/F going to a community college. My grades aren't as bad as they could be but they certainly aren't the best I can do. I feel like my depression is eating away every ounce of success I can get. 

I want to drop out. I feel like college just isn't for me. I feel like I'm not mentally stable enough to get through. I don't think my parents would let...I might really try to talk to them about it.

I hate talking to my parents about my depression sometimes, though. Every now and then, they through the, "Oh, it's just your period." or  "Maybe your medicine isn't working right." at me. Does it really matter that much? I'm not happy...

As of now, I am working (illustrator) on a children's book for someone and she is paying me. She has a lot more to come and doing this as a career would make me happy. I don't understand why my mom wouldn't just let me drop out of college and do this instead. This is my dream. I mean, I am getting paid so why not?
