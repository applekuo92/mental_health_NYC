I just skipped one of my last physics exams because I forgot my calculator in my room. I went to grab it and I soon as I got back to my room I just couldn't make myself go back. What? Why!!?! I have to do this shit but I cant because my mind just decides that some days i'm just not allowed to do stuff. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life any more.
