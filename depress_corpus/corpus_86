I have absolutely no purpose in life at the moment, I start university in October but Im very anxious about it and I've yet to find a room / an apartment to live in because we are very poor, so that kinda doesnt help.


My days are just sleeping long, eating, browsing reddit and watching videos / tv shows.


Cant even get enjoyment out of video games anymore. 


The girl I really liked and started seeing texted me she's not interested in a relationship right now, that also brought me down and fueled my depression again. 


Sorry for this messy post I just had to get shit out probably.
