You have no idea why you've caught it. It closes all programs as soon as they open. You get a snippet of hope as you see the program opening in the taskbar, only to be immediately let down as it closes itself. 

You're left staring into a desktop background it has made just for you: dark and hopeless and sad. 

You avoid even turning on your computer, opting to just stay in sleep mode for most of the day.

You feel ashamed of being the only one who can't seem to shake this virus and avoid anyone seeing your shame.

To strangers or friends you act like its functioning fine, pretending to relate to their small talk. You are perpetually isolated.

To the few you do tell about the problem, you find them laughing it off, telling you to reboot or just open a new program - as if you haven't tried that already. 

The frustration is intense. A handful promise it will disappear on its own. Another few recommend antivirus software that you struggle to buy, let alone activate successfully. 

You feel desperate and alone, and seriously consider shutting down once and for all.

But the promise that maybe one day programs will open, maybe some miracle will occur, leaves you staring into the desktop abyss, numb and alone, writing clunky horrible metaphors on the back of your hand.
