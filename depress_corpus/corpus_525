I've decided to finally get help. I'll be contacting my school social worker ASAP on Monday when they open.

I've decided to not surround myself with the negativity that is this subreddit. Don't get me wrong; I loved posting on here to vent and I loved looking through posts to help others. However, it never really helped *me*. Simply venting out my problems only worked wonders for a moment, if at all.

As I go, I'd like to say thank you. Thank you for those who read my posts. Thank you for those who commented on them. Thank you for those who may not have commented, but spared a moment to think about me.

I wish everyone on this subreddit good luck, and may everyone find their own source of help, be it professional, from a friend or simply continuing to use this subreddit. <3
