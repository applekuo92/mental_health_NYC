I am a dipshit.  I don't suffer from depression.  I've known my wife 10 years, lived with her for 8, married for 7, and I'm just beginning to pull my head out of my ass and understand how she thinks and suffers with depression.

And I'm just astonished how obtuse I've been - me - the touchy-feely, helper-of-the-disabled, captain empathy, father of a disabled child, master's degreed, complete dipshit.

Hopefully I can pass along a few insights to help others avoid some pitfalls of the condition heretofore known as "Dipshittery".  It'll be in the DSM-VI I'm pretty sure.

You (the Dipshit) will say the following (bold) and they (the individual suffering depression) should reply:

**1. "You SHOULD just… [feel better] [change your attitude] [appreciate blah blah blah] [stop being so blah blah blah].**

Really?  No shit.  All the therapy.  All the medication.  And it never crossed my fucking mind to just stop.  You, dipshit, are a goddamn genius.  Who would've thought it could be so easy.

**2. "Why can't you just be…[happy] [appreciative] [positive]"**

…for the same reason some people don't survive a gunshot to the head and others do.  JUST BECAUSE.  That's why.  You think I signed up for this shit?  You think I was first in line to swallow the "feel shitty about self for no good reason" pill?  You truly are a dipshit if you think I CAN but simply WON'T change my state of mind.

Can you change from being such a shithead?  Go ahead, show me how it's done Captain Intellect.

**3. "Why can't you be happy for me?"**

Umm… because being happy isn't something I do well and you're success likely spotlights one of my many real or imagined shortcomings.  

Yes… I'm a bit self-absorbed.  It's kind of the definition of depression dipshit… to be focused on the self.  Just not in a good way… more in a, "how do I make it through the day in one piece."  So I'm busy right now trying to not sabotage myself with negative self-thought.

So sorry if I'm too preoccupied to wave a banner because you're happy about something.

**4. "Focus on all the good things."**

Read #1 again, dipshit.

So, Dipshit, are you starting to get it?  You're dealing with a hyper-sensitive creature and absolutely NONE of your standard dipshit lines and philosophies are going to help.

You wanna' help?  Probably not.  Then leave and do everyone a favor.  But I have kids so I HAD to figure it out (or I would've likely taken the first train to Happy Town.)

You REALLY wanna' help?  Then when your friend/partner starts going to crazy town, realize that…

* Making rational arguments, connecting the dots, providing data… it's pointless.  Completely pointless so shut up.  We're not in that place right now, so don't bring your pithy marshmallows to an emotional inferno.

* How about reminding them that, "Hey, I'm sure you don't like feeling this way.  On the long list of potential emotional responses, I'm sure your current one isn't at the top of your list either.  Don't sweat it.  I get it - sorta'."  

At times they're going to take it out on you, but it isn't about you.  Check your ego at the door.

* Since you don't have the manual on "The Right Emotion for Every Situation," maybe you can just lay off a bit?  You know they're being crazy.  They know they're being crazy.  There needs to be some "crazy space".  They'll come back from it and appreciate your understanding and compassion.  You might even get laid.

* Why don't you use this as an opportunity to check YOUR massive ego.  Is there a cosmic law that states you deserve fair treatment, or to be heard, or to be represented accurately?  

Ummm… I just checked with Neil deGrasse Tyson.  He says you deserve two things in the cosmos: JACK and SHIT.  

Ditch the ego.  You're going to die, your thoughts and ideas are all bullshit you tell yourself, and in the end nothing matters beyond how you've treated people.  So stop talking, throw down a hug, let a brother know you're on their side.  You might even get laid.

* If they had a flesh-eating bacteria and wanted to cry about it, you'd be His Royal Provider of Empathy and All Things Comforting.  You would NEVER say your typical dipshit lines.  

So, if you need to, pretend they have a happiness-eating bacteria in their brain.  Then maybe you can stop being such a dick.

I'm still a dipshit.  I don't have all the answers.  But I'm trying to survive and create a positive, nuturing, loving culture in my house.  I don't have control over how my wife responds to situations.  But I have complete control over how I choose to respond.  So that's what I focus on.
