My depression has the opposite effect on me, it makes me want to eat a lot every time I get sad. I've been obese my whole life and I fear I'm starting to get health problems because of that. I've tried to lose weight many times before but it's really hard to eat less and exercise when you don't have any energy or motivation at all... I wish I didn't want to eat. Is it weird?

EDIT: Forgot a word. Also, I know that not eating is as bad as over-eating, it's just that I am obese and if I could lose weight without trying it would be one thing less to worry about I guess
