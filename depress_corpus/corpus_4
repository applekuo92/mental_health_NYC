Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys.
