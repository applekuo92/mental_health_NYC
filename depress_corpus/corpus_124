This is something that's been really bothering me for a long while.

I just... dont care.  
And not in a good way. Not in a "things aren't going well but that's ok" way. It's more of a "I'm just too tired and lonely to feel any emotions" kind of thing.  
Nothing really makes me happy. The only person that made me feel anything is gone now. I don't really have any hobbies, I don't play video games. I distract myself from nothingness with a lot of music.  
It's been going on for years.

Everything is bleak.
