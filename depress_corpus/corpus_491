I was the bookworm kid. 

Reading used to be a huge escape for me as a kid, but since I've grown up, and the depression's gotten worse, things just...don't click? Maybe it's the lack of quality in YA fiction, but I don't know. I can't bury myself into a book anymore.

It just makes me feel sad. It's like a part of me's been scrubbed away.

EDIT: Thank you all for the support and recommendations! It's nice feeling excited and actually wanting to go to the library again.
