Any time I am feeling depressed or sad for a couple days, if I have a nice rainy or just dark and gross day, it makes me feel better. The past couple days I have felt pretty bad but this morning it was grey out, i went for a drive around in the water and just felt better, came home and had a pretty okay day. Anyone else really like that kind of weather?
