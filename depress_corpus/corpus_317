I don't give a fuck about my IQ. It means nothing if I can't even get out of bed. Don't fucking try making me feel guilty about being depressed and being "smart". 

Yeah I'm an asshole for "bragging" about my fucking IQ. I'm just a waste of this potential you speak of. I wish someone else who wants to live could have this so that everybody would stop guilt tripping me about being so "smart". 

Sorry about this post, I just need to get this off my chest
