So I went through a shitty breakup about 4 months ago with my first love and I've been heartbroken ever since

Long story short I went to one of her classes and was like "dude I need to get something off my chest". And I told her I was sick of us avoiding eye contact and avoiding each other in the halls and I am sorry that our relationship didn't work out but I just wanted to put that in the past and be friends like we used to.

And now we are and things are okay... I just feel so at peace
