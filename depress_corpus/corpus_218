This may sound a little weird, but ever since i was young, i had periods when i was feeling really shitty. Now at that time i didnt really know what depression really was, and, since my life is okay, i had parents, siblings and friends that i know love me, but still i was often sad. I was never suicidal, its something i could never do, cause i know it would really hurt the ones i love. So i would have this, i guess you could say fantasies of my parents and my siblings dying in some accident or something.

 My logic was that if they died i would have a reason to feel this way. People would understand why i cant concentrate on school, or enjoy myself when i go out with friends. It was better option than me committing suicide, cause only i would suffer, not other people if i killed myself. This kind of thoughts would happen a lot, ans still do. I still feel like an ungrateful shit, cause they are people in situations way worse than mine. 

Right now im working up the courage to tell my parents about my depression and find a therapist. Every night i say to myslef that i'm gonna tell them tomorrow, but i never do, mostly because i know that they will think it's their fault, and i dont wanna make them feel bad.
