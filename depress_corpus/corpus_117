I barely know her, I talked to her once because she lives nearby and my roommate knows her from college. Basically, we're almost strangers. Tonight we were both on the sidewalk going in the opposite direction, then she stopped right after passing me.


Her: Are you ok?

[I turn to her, not sure if she was talking to me]

Her: Are you feeling good?

Me: Euh... I don't know

Her: You seem like really sad to me.

Me: Oh... It happens, I'm gonna be ok

Her: Are you sure? 

Me: Yeah. That's kind of you but don't worry

Her: Ok then but...

Me: Nah I'll be fine. Thanks. Good night [weak smile]


I don't know what's the saddest part, that my depression is becoming so apparent that an almost stranger passing by notices it or that I faked being ok because there was no way she could ever help me. Still, that was pretty sweet from her.
