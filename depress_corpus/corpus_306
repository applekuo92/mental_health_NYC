I'm coming to my wits end it seems. I've been doing something wrong my entire life that I can't figure out. I'm  repelling people away from me. I've never had a girlfriend or best friends or really any friends. I'm in college at the moment and the isolation and loniness is driving me insane. Listening to the parties outside makes me want to jump off a cliff. Please help



Edit:

I didn't realize how many people were in the same boat as me. I've been tearing up while reading some of these comments, because some of the things y'all are saying are difficulties that I didn't include in my post. Someone mentioned that they get excited when their phone lights up in hope that it's someone asking them to go out, or eating alone in the dining hall, hating the fact that people "act happy". A lot of these things I can relate too, and clearly many more can relate as well. There's so much more I haven't read, and I just wanted to thank you guys. My morning has been much better reading through all of this. :) I was starting to think that it was just me.
