I don't really have anything profound to say, or any point to make. I just need to express the way I'm feeling in some way or another.

College is hard with depression. It's so hard to pay attention when you're constantly drawn inward by the feeling of dread and anxiety ripping away at your innards. It takes so much effort just to keep depression at bay. Trying to do that *and* trying to learn just feels so impossible. Even when I do pay attention, I find that I don't actually retain much of the information. I'm sitting in class right now and I should be doing the activities and learning, but instead I'm just sitting here on reddit trying to distract myself from myself by posting a sob story. I'm so useless.
