Wish me luck guys, Ive struggled through some awful shit for the past 20 years of my life and now I found that glimmer of hope- just that glimmer of hope and I want to change my life forever. Going to go all out despite the odds staked against me

EDIT 1: Thank you so much for all the support. Depression is the worst it creeps up on you without notice. I am trying ever so hard to get out from this hole and try to find some success I dearly crave for. Despite the shitty moods, feelings and emotions from being depressed, I want to try and try harder everyday. I admit I havent been successful on some days but hoping yesterday's success is the start of many more success to come. Lets push through kind redditors
