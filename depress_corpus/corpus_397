Today is National Suicide Prevention day. If you or a loved one is suffering due to a loss or needs help themselves please offer help -Crisis Line: 1-800-273-8255, (910) 392-7408...you are not alone. As someone who suffers from depression, this is such a personal issue for me.And, as someone who TRIED and did not succeed, I can tell you that I am so glad it didn't work! I got the help I needed (therapy, medication, a different outlook) and I am so glad-I live a full and decent life now. One I would have missed out on had I succeeded. 

 Please reach out-you are NOT alone, it is your depression or situation that tells you this.
In honor of: Nicole, Jayme, Ryan, Will, Rob, Audrie, Kurt, Brodie, Saani, Colton, Dawn, Amanda, Jordan, Jeremy, Mindy, Evan, Michael...the list goes on-Please feel free to add your own names so that I/We, may say a prayer for them and their families.
