I came out to her in June and it's been hell living with her ever since. I am moving out starting tomorrow. I guess she thought today would be a good day to tell me everything she thought about me. She began yelling at me about how I can never be happy without god and that one day I will realize that. She also said "that's why you people are protesting all the time, you aren't happy without god," to which i responded with "we protest because there's millions of kids who kill themselves because they have parents like you." She said " if you wanna kill yourself, kill yourself." 
This happened while i was getting ready for my girlfriend's birthday dinner just now. But now I can't stop crying.

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone who took the time to respond to this post, regardless. I wanted to give a quick update today. I had a wonderful time with my girlfriend and her beautiful family, it was just what I needed. I'm currently in the process of moving and am surrounding myself with people who love and support me. Thank you everyone for your thoughts and advice.
