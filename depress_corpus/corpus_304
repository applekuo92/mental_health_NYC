I'm just curious about the different faces of depression. Would you mind sharing yours with me?  
Here's mine: [I'm having a very lazy day](http://imgur.com/CztI61J)  
*Edit: Wow! I seriously didn't expect this many reactions, but I'm really glad how this turned out.  
This morning I thought about how many different kinds of people suffer from depression, and got curious. I just finished watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, figured I'd check Reddit for a moment and saw that the rest of the world had mostly woken up by now and there were around 130 reactions to this post. Many of them beautiful faces in all shapes and sizes, and as it seems even more people commenting really nice things about said faces.  
I just wanted to thank you all and let you know I really appreciate your awesomeness.  
PS: I'm crying ;')*  
**Update:** Please keep sharing pictures! It's never too late to join the party :)  
I've been trying to upvote every single comment but there's 1300 of them now and I have to go to work in half an hour. Once I've forced myself to take a shower, I'll put up a new pic that actually properly shows off my hair ;)
