I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a couple years ago, and I've been aware of these symptoms (and their worsening) since I was around 14.

Well, I've had a relatively shitty life, and one of the things I always did to cope was to imagine myself in different universes.  They are generally of whatever book series or media/video game/anime I am interested in at the time.

Except, now I'm 19 and with all the imagining I can do, I can't imagine anything good for my own life.  In fact, it would be accurate to say that I am largely disassociated with my own life.  I spend much of my time imagining myself to be anywhere but here.  Even when I did have a job (long story short I quit due to panic attack and now I have an appointment set with vocational rehabilitation next week), I spent much of my time just daydreaming.  It's-- not healthy.  It's gotten to the point where it's just sad.  I could never kill myself but I wouldn't mind if I didn't exist anymore.  I'm too depressed to have a creative outlet for my overactive imagination, as I've lost interest in all aspects of my life.  I've lost touch with a lot of my friends.  I'm left with a deep longing for happiness and a different life and mind.  

Most people look forward to things like securing a good job, marrying somebody they love, and having kids.  I am asexual and don't see a future for myself when it comes to family.  I hardly feel human at this point.  I know I did at some point but that point is not now, and I just have gotten used to this in a sick way.  My therapist and rational part of my mind says I need to be on medication, but I grew up around a family who did nothing but medicate and abuse drugs to solve problems and I see it as a personal failure if I give in.  

Oddly, I don't judge other people for needing medication, but when it comes to me I feel like the weakest and most pathetic piece of shit in the whole world.
