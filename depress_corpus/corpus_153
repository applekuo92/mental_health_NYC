I've become so apathetic about things that should really matter in life. When I think about things like failing uni, losing relationships, messing up my future etc. all I feel is a kind of numbness. I truly can't bring myself to care. I used to be so anxious about these things all the time, I used to feel physically ill. But now I go through life feeling numb and grey. I can't be bothered getting help because I don't really care about getting better. 

But...the smallest thing can set off a full meltdown and suddenly I feel the weight of every failure on my back. Burn the last piece of toast and suddenly I'm hysterically crying about how I'm going to fail uni and ruin my future and I'm such a worthless idiot etc etc. 

I don't understand why I can't make myself care when I need to or in any meaningful way. At least when I'm anxious I am working hard and trying to make/keep friendships etc.
