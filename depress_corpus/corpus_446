I told him he wouldn't have to deal with my shit anymore if I was dead. He instantly broke down in tears and started to beg me to stay alive. I kept telling him I'm worthless, stupid, and have no meaning to be here. He went full on insane and I couldn't even recognize his voice. I felt so uncomfortable and told him to cut the act. He told me he wasn't acting and that I mean the world to him. I asked how? I've done nothing great in my life. He has a daughter who is a nobody. He said the proudest day of his life was when we were at a restaurant and a waiter spilled a cup of water on the floor and some of the water got on me but I helped the waiter clean up and wasn't mad and laughed about it. I went to the bathroom and the waiter said I was a good person. I don't remember this happening to me.

On Monday, I am going to a psychiatric hospital to get help. I don't think it will work but I have to try. My depression tells me I deserve to be dead. But a little voice in my head is telling me one day I can be truly happy.
