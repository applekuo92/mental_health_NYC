Sorry if this is the wrong place. I don't think suicide watch is the proper place since I don't necessarily want to commit suicide. I just want to cease living.

I feel like no matter what I can't escape the demons I have. No matter how well I'm doing, my mind is always like "the fuck? Get back in line." No matter what, they'll always come back up and I'll be in my room alone at nearly 2 in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me.

Even then it doesn't even really matter if they're mad or not. I'd be dead.

**Edit to add: Thank you everyone for responding. You all truly helped calm me down. Now that I've gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights, I feel better.**

**That too, has passed. This too, shall pass.**

**If ANY of you need an ear, or a digital shoulder to digitally cry on, I'd love to be there for you. Shoot me a PM anytime.**
