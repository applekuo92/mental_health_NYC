June 24th is the day I had planned to kill myself. For months I have had this planned, down to the minute of the day. I had the gun in my hand and the note taped to the mirror, and I was ready to do this. I wasn't afraid, I wasn't anxious. I was ready. I was happy to be rid of this miserable disease we call life. 
It's funny how such a simple sentence can change your perspective on so much. 
"I can't do this without you."

June 24th is the day I threw away my razor blades. June 24th is the day I put down the gun and I burned the note I had so neatly written.

June 24th is the day my life begins.

EDIT: wow... Thank you guys so much for your support. And thanks for the gold! Love you guys <3
