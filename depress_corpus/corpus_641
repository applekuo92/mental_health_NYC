In 2015, my dog, my mother, and my sisters were killed in a head-on collision.  My father, who until recently was a recovery alcoholic, comes home from work empty-he's just a shell of a man. He's cold, metal, and robotic.  He doesn't have any emotions.  All he does is go to work and church, then looks at photographs of our family.  

My "support" has been forced on me by school administration and students alike.  My sisters were fairly popular at our school, but the support isn't for me: It's for their bitchy, stuck-up airhead friends.  Everyday I'm required to check in with my counselor for our "happy" meeting where I'm drilled for half an hour on how it will all be over soon-about how what I'm feeling is temporary.  Each day the words she spouts mean less and less as I feel myself slip away. 

I don't want to do anything anymore.  I quit my job, I just fucking cry and jack off in my room because I don't want to deal with problems that can't be fixed.  I've tried, believe me I've tried.  I've seen three different professionals but they're all carbon copies of the other that just prescribe me shit that only makes me constipated or erect.

I feel like I haven't slept for a year.  Each day I feel more exhausted than the previous.  People that once made me social and happy now just cause me anxiety and confusion.  I used to have fun hanging out with them but I stopped feeling enjoyment.  I've stopped feeling anything.

I want it to be over but I never have the balls to actually do it.
