A while back Wil Wheaton passed along this advice to someone who posted to this message board. Seeing those words changed my life. I still have depression, but reading these four words was a reminder for me to focus on the part of me that isn't depressed. This past Saturday I was going to get the quote tattooed on myself, but opted for this instead. I'm a righty, guided by my right hand and every time I catch the tattoo out of the corner of my eye, I'm reminded that I am not this disease.

Just wanted to share. (Thanks Wil. Your words changed my life.)
