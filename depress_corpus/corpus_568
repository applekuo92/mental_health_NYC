I've been very depressed for the past 3 months. Saw a therapist and started taking prozac. I'm still depressed, but not as bad as I was. I think a big part of me felt no purpose in life because I haven't worked for 3 months. So I started applying for jobs. Had my first interview on Tuesday, was offered the job on Thursday. I'm looking forward to going back to work, the office is really cool. I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess just to give some of you a little hope, and thank those of you who I've had the pleasure of talking to on here.
