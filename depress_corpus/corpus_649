I've decided that the only way I'm going to get myself out of this shithole of a depression is by making myself a better person. I'm going to gain muscle, smile at strangers, talk to girls, pay better attention in class, and worry about myself more often. Even if I slip up, and fall back in that hole of sadness I can always say I gave it my best. Today's the day where I force myself to be what I've always wanted to be. Fuck you, depression.
