I was very down this morning and sitting all by myself during break, I had my head down with my eyes closed when all of a sudden I felt sombody sit next to me. I look up and see that it's the girl that I like. She didn't ask if I was ok or why I look so sad. She just sat there and we started talking. It made me so happy it almost made me cry. I don't know if this is the apropriate place for this but I just needed to tell sombody. 

**EDIT** Jeez, I didn't expect so many people to read this and upvote it (I couldn't care less about karma) But jeez... :') You guys do rock.

**UPDATE** I actually went and sat down with a group today and while I was sitting down I felt a little nudge behind me, it was her! There were plenty more seats where we are sitting but she decided to stand by me! Then when break was over she wated up so we could talk about her new haircut... Golly is she a swell gal :)
