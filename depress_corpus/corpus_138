So, yesterday I had a post talking about people saying suicide is selfish. Just like the title suggests, think twice before opening your mouth. I honestly believe when people spread their ignorence around this topic it will do the greatest harm. There is a stigma around any mental health issues and because of this people needing help won't reach out. They will feel the guilt and feel blamed. Before you say anything to someone who is hurting deep down you should do some research.  IT COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE. Someone sent me this quote and I couldn't agree more with it.


 David Foster Wallace once said:

"The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."
