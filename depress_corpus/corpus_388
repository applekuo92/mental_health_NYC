Like my title says, people these days don't seem to give two fucks about depression, anxiety, or any other mental disorder that doesn't affect THEM. 

Even when it leads to disastrous consequences. Take for example what happened in Calgary; 5 people were stabbed to death by someone who had mental problems in the past and likely had some kind of schizophrenic episode. Of course, people like to bash on about how "oh he'll end up in a mental ward instead of jail or death". Even when people are FUCKING DEAD as a result of this guy not being able to get any kind of mental health treatment, people still don't care. 

If there was more focus on treatment and not just "oh get over it/youll be fine" from parents, teachers, academics, etc, maybe those five people would be alive today. 

Sorry. It just hurts.
