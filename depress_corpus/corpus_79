Hey Reddit. About a year ago I was diagnosed with both bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder both. It's really rough because sometimes I'll get depressed for a week at a time, only to get out of that funk and immediately get depressed for a month straight. In August I came to college and it's been really rough so far. Whenever I've been in a good mood, things have been really nice. I like to keep a workout routine going, and I'll be sociable with the people around me, even though I haven't really made friends yet.

However, when I'm not in a good mood it becomes awful. I get so lonely and sad that I just stay in my dorm room all day playing video games and hating myself. The only person I have that I can consistently talk to who cares about me is my girlfriend, but we're five hours apart thanks to college.

Anyways, for the past couple of weeks I've been so depressed that I've even been skipping classes, which is something that I never do. I haven't eaten because I didn't want to leave my dorm, I haven't worked out, I've just been sitting in my room playing video games and trying to get out of bed at least once in a day.

But today was different. Today, I woke up at around 9:30 and immediately got up and showered. I went and got coffee and an english muffin from a cafe, and sat down and wrote out a schedule for the day. I worked out, I wrote up a study guide for my psychology exam, and as I'm typing this I'm about to go get my laundry out of the dryer. Today has been a good day.

Sorry for the rant, it just feels nice to finally do something. I feel like I'm actually taking care of myself for once.
