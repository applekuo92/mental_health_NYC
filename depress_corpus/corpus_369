It says "you don't have a condition, or a disorder. You're just a lazy, selfish dope who mopes around for attention." When that voice starts going off, that's when I feel the most depressed. Isn't it ironic? I don't know whether to believe I have depression or I'm just a whiny little whimp. It's nights like these when I have the creeping sensation that I'm an objectively bad person.
