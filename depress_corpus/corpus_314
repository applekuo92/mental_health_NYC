Even with lexapro, I've been sleeping my days away. I keep using the peaceful void of sleep to fulfill my longing for the peaceful void of death.

I know a lot of us constantly fantasize and wish for death, but don't have the courage to follow through with suicide. Personally, I just sleep most of the day away and pretend I'm dead while I'm sleeping.

Does anyone have any advice on how to jump start getting more active? Part of it is a lack of energy that I know will significantly improve with more activity. It just seems impossible though. If I can't even get out of bed in the morning, how am I supposed to start exercising? It's a catch 22, need some help please.
