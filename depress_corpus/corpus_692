I don't fear sadness. In the distress of sadness, despite the likelihood of negative coping, I still seek out ways to recover. 

I fear apathy. The apathy that leaves you paralyzed as you watch your life fall apart. The apathy that leaves you content to watch yourself drown from the futility of breathing in, the desire to drift away from the things that keep you living: wishing that family and friends would forget you. You begin realize what a burden you are, people's live would be better without you. You begin to find peace while thinking of ways to leave this life, only to become angered when you're unable to let go: stuck starting at a noose or a bottle of pills, stuck standing on the ledge unable to step off yet unable to step away: many aren't as lucky.

I don't fear feeling sad, I fear the apathy that keeps me from feeling anything besides the emptiness.The apathy that strips away the memories of ever having felt at all.
