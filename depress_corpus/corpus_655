It's honestly strange. You sit there, with the busiest mind, thinking a thousand different thoughts while trying to think of nothing at all. And meanwhile, your body is so tired, your muscles are sore, and you can't move. Whether or not you know you have to, doing more than shuffling a little is exhausting. It's upsetting too.  And confusing. And lots of feelings.

There's a million time-consuming things I have to accomplish within the hour, and I know that good stuff is happening when I'm done. But I can't move. I'll be unhappy if I'm late to get started, I'll be more unhappy when I'm rushing and can't enjoy anything. So that's what I'm doing. Sitting here, watching my cat purr and rub her head on my dresser, half-naked, and I can't get started.


TL;DR  Depression is some kind of way fucked up.
