If you're going through a tough time with depression, know that somebody loves you and they wish that you would tell them because they would do anything in the world to at least be there for you, and hug, and reminisce about the good days. If you're going to do it, and nobody is going to be able to change your mind, please spend your last days with loved ones. They really wish it and it would help the ones you leave behind. Please


Edit: thank you all for your kind words. If anyone feels like maybe this helped them go another day living then I give a but of comfort in that. It's still very new and fresh. I don't know if it's appropriate or if I will want to do it. But I'm considering doing a post where I describe some of what happened and how he was found. I think if maybe someone hears what it's, like to find your family member, maybe they'll hold on an extra day.
