***Being alone or feeling alone is horrible***

The worst part about depression can be the sheer loneliness, and the inability to express it. Feeling depressed makes people want to be alone (but not lonely) when they really shouldn't be. If you care, please check on your depressed loved-ones, often. Offering to simply hangout means so much.

Insulting, acting negatively or being in denial towards depressed people makes them feel even more isolated and unloved from you and in turn they won't trust you, or anyone else. If you are someone they look up to or consider close to you then you are a huge factor into them feeling better or worse.

Just saying "you'll be there" is not enough. It's a nice sentiment but you have to mean it and put it into practice, approach them even at times. So many have said they'll be there for me but simply haven't.

***You can't just "be happy", "get over it" or "snap out of it"***

Most people who suffer from depression have had someone say these things to them at some point in time. But it doesn't work like that. Don't you think that I would have "gotten over it" a long time ago if I could?

And it is unfair to expect a person to undo depression by merely thinking happy thoughts, while the human brain is incredible and a person can be mindful of forming new neural passageways, you can’t change a lamp into an elephant overnight, just as you can’t un-think a tumor from happening. It takes time.

Depression can last for long periods of time, even when a person wishes more than anything to wake up and be over it one morning. It’s a process, and one that looks different for everyone. Some people go running, others meet new people or take up a new hobby in effort to help themselves. The one method guaranteed to fail is telling a depressed person to “snap out of it.”

***People with depression are not attention seekers***

There are exceptions to nearly every rule, but the vast majority of people with depression are most certainly not attention seekers. If they were, then why are they not famous for saying "I'm fine" when they feel miserable? Why do they go to extreme lengths to hide their cuts if they self-harm? And why does suicide usually come as such a shock? The truth is that most people with depression hide their pain, often out of fear of being judged or discriminated against.

***Depression has little to do with life's circumstances***

Just because a person suffers from depression, it doesn't mean that they're a negative or an ungrateful person. Depression is an illness, and it can happen to anyone, positive and grateful people included.

Sometimes we can feel like we don’t have the right to be depressed because no great tragedy has occurred to us. But that’s not always how depression works. Sometimes it can be the direct result of a life event, but most times a chemical imbalance in the brain or an unresolved emotional issue sits at the core. Depression does not discriminate. It happens to the best of us.

***Anyone can fall victim to depression***

Depression is one of those illnesses that doesn't discriminate. No matter how much money you make or what gender, age, sexuality, colour or creed you are, you're at risk of falling victim.

***It's a real illness***

Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Just because it's an invisible illness, it doesn't mean that it isn't real. Frankly it's an immensely overlooked and under-cared for illness that has destructive effects on all aspects of life.

***One "good" day doesn't cure depression***

People with depression can have "good" days where they don't feel depressed, they can have days where they even feel happy. But it's a mistake to assume that just because they feel good one day, that they're no longer sick and therefore should feel good every day.

***There is no one universal cure***

I wish people knew that medications isn't the only solution or a solution for everyone. Millions of people don’t respond to medications. It can have side effects and make depression worse in some aspects.

There are many different solutions to come together that can help cure or dissipate depression. Such as: Medication, therapy, meditation, mindfulness, time, personal-growth, friends/family, greater purpose, exercise and diet. There is hope and huge chance for many to get better. Money and things don't cure depression.

***It's difficult, spontaneous and scary***

I wish people knew that the hardest thing some persons will ever do in this lifetime is to stay alive, that just because staying alive comes easily to some, it doesn’t mean arriving at a natural death is any less of a triumph for those who have to work so very hard to keep breathing every day.

I wish people knew that sometimes depression is triggered by something and sometimes it’s not, that sometimes one small thing is needed to pull a person out of darkness, and sometimes everything is unable to, that sometimes the only thing you can do is to wait for symptoms to subside.
