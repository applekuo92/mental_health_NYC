It's almost like I feel it's contagious. Like my best friend has severe depression so she understands what it's like. But when I'm down I feel like it's rude to talk to her about it because she's dealing with it herself and who wants to be reminded of that? Like the only time I want to hear or talk about depression is when I'm sick.

This goes double for my girl friend. She wants to comfort me and see me better and opening up to her does help. But I'm so logical and break everything down to be analyzed so much that I feel like as I'm talking to her I'm helping her see the things I'm depressed about and then it brings her down some too.

So, TLDR: does anyone not share they're feelings like you think it's contagious?

Edit: front page! Hooray depression!
