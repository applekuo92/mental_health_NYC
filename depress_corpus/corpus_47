In July 2013, a redditor told me on a comment thread that he was planning on killing himself by age 21, and I just wanted to say:

Have a happy birthday, and remember that we here at r/depression care! I know this year has sucked, and I'm here to let you know that it WILL work out, and if I care enough to remember your birthday when you told me in July, others do too. Stay with us, death sucks, don't die, and PLEASE don't end yourself because you DO matter! We love you!
