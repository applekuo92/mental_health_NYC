or psychologist. Well either way, once i was telling her it's just not fair that physical illnesses and psychological ones are not treated equally. And then she came out with the "but psychological illnesses are different because you made them" thing. I am speechless honestly. I don't think I should change therapist YET ANOTHER TIME. Maybe I should just stop going and die.

EDIT: I was trying to tell her how someone with a flu could say "sorry i don't feel really well so I will be staying home" while me, feeling like complete (excuse me) shit because of depression, not being able to open mouth without ending up crying all my tears and wanting to die, all of this to the point of feeling physical pain in the stomach, heart and everything, I can't say that same thing because, you know, it's just psychological.

I used to go violin lessons but many times, when feeling really down, I wouldn't go. Sometimes I told them and other I didn't because well depression made me see everything black and I couldn't bother telling them "hey I'm staying home" and having them reply "LIKE FUCK YOU ARE GET YOUR ASS HERE". And that's where I had this guy, studying to become a teacher, who just told me "I don't know what your problems are, but at a certain point you GROW UP and leave them behind" as if depression was a matter of growing up.
