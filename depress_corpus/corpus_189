I got my Driver's license today.

It's surreal.

I've wanted this day to come for 9 years (I'm 25). Life circumstances and not having someone to teach me full-time put it off.

I began to get frustrated. When I was in undergrad, and everyone around me had a license and a car passed down to them or brought by a family member.

I had to rely on people to give me rides. I was always scared to ask and I was embarrassed. 

I once had to walk in the rain from my off campus apartment to get to class, and I was soaked to my shoes and got my rental textbooks wet.

I had to walk in the 90 degree sun to get to work one summer, and I would be sweaty and miserable and feel disgusting.

I could never just go to the store if I wanted to, or go experience things I wanted to do.

I suppose the only good thing was that I saved money, and that I was never a DD, because hell, I couldn't be.

It's been a rough few months. Having to relocate permanently to my mom's after being dumped. Not holding work for almost a year, my depression and anxiety getting hard to manage because I have no health insurance.

But now I finally have something. Once again, I'm not excited as I should be because I tell myself, "You should have had it by now." "You still don't have your own car." "Your face is fat in the picture."

I know my mom isn't going to let me driver her car whenever I want to. 

But it's a start. 

I wish I felt more proud of myself.
