... I kept feeling like every greeting i did to customers entering the shop that it was a fake smile and could feel the need to cry everytime i put one of those fake smiles on. Then it just all came out in front of a lady in her 50's. She didn't really know what to do, but she stayed by my side and talked me through it. I was incredibly embarrassed and I really do not want to go into work again. But if that Old Lady hadn't of been there to somewhat calm me down, I would be in a worse way post shift state than what i currently am. There are always people in the world to help you in the end.
