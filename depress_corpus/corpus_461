Horrible as it may seem, I mostly do this when people don't seem to be demonstrating that they care about me, even though I know they somehow do. It's like I can't just believe that people care about me or that they would react if something did happen to me- I wish I could see how they would react to something as horrible as me dying just to be reassured that I do mean something to them.

Or I may just be evil and vindictive. It may just be that I hate that I don't matter enough to them, that they don't spend enough time with me or thinking about me, and that I want to haunt them because I feel as if it would serve them right for not including me in things. It's childish, really.

I don't blame you if you respond saying that I'm selfish and that I should go to hell. But I guess I needed to somehow get the idea out of my system.

*UPDATE:....You guys really are the best.
