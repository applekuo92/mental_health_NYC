I feel so out of place,everyone in my life is having fun,living their youth years  and I'm a suicidal wreck.  I'm missing out on life. My loneliness is soul crushing.
Also,the thought of everyone leaving me feels sort of...freeing. How weird is that? I guess because I'd have nothing to lose then?Idk,man.

I'd appreciate /r/depression's input on this...

edit:ok, I'd hug every single one of you.
