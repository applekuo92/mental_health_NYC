I am black. I'm a woman. I'm also fat. Everyday I have to deal with microagressions centering around my race, gender, and size. I've been call intimidating. I've been accused of being unapproachable. People assume I can handle a great deal of verbal abuse. Here's the truth: I'm shy and have social anxiety. I'm super sensitive. I've been depressed for half my life. I have a hard time standing up for myself. I'm lonely and it's difficult for me to make friends. Everyday I have to talk myself into going to work because little comments about my identity really do get to me. I just wish people would stop assuming that I'm this strong invulnerable creature.
