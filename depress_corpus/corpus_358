I'm am actually having kind of a shitty couple of days, but I just saw the little cake icon by my name.

1 year ago I was SO much worse off.

It's been a year of ups and downs, but many more ups, and I hope that if anyone's reading this and feeling suicidal, you'll procrastinate on it ;) or reach out for help.

Good luck to everybody in this sub and pm me if I can support you at all. I love you guys.
