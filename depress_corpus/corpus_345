I am(hands raised). 

I lie to people everyday, family, friends, everyone, I don't discriminate. I say things I don't mean, give smiles I don't intend, gesture like an a-list actor because if I showed my true hand, I'd be even more alone. I pretend, I kid, all framed by fantasies of death and despair seconds apart. 

Misery loves company but attracts none, so I'm a liar. One of the best.
