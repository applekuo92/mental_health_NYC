I have very little motivation most of the time.  I know this could easily be depression-related.  But, looking back at my life, the only thing that ever motivated me was pressure to succeed.  Now that I worry less about living up to peoples expectations of me, its hard to find motivation to do much. I'm just dragging myself through life, doing what I need to do to get by.  I don't enjoy much.... that's a part of a lot of peoples depression.  But did I ever really enjoy anything that much?  I don't think so.

I'm a very pessimistic, lazy person.  I'm selfish.  I complain and whine a lot.  I'm no fun to be around most of the time.  I know depression and anxiety are things I'm continuing to fight....but I can't help but think that a lot of this is just really who I am.
