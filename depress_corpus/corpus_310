You have no idea how much that actually meant to me...and I wish I could've said thank you at the time.  To be surrounded by so much negativity within my own thoughts, it was nice to actually have someone feel proud of me for once.


**Edit:** Thank you all for your responses!  It's nice to see that this community is extremely supportive and caring.  I'm going to try and respond to anyone and everyone that comments.
