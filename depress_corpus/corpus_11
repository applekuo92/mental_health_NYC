People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.
