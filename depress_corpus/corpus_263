A few months ago, we blacklisted the site and domain due to high-volume, persistent comment-spamming in the sub.

Since then, we've received dozens of complaints about this person sending imitation "personal" PMs to many of the OPs here in /r/depression, using a variety of different alt accounts, a variety of different first names, but only minor variations on the same boilerplate text which includes fake-personal comments like "sorry to bother you, please ignore if you're not interested". That wears a bit thin when people get these PMs by the handful.

As far as we've been able to determine, the subreddit appears to be a one-person/many-alt-account operation and it exists solely to circumvent reddit's spam-detection logic and drive traffic to the site. Please don't visit the site or the subreddit, and please report all PMs promoting either  the Catharticsite subreddit or cathartic.co as spam.

We hate to take up one of our sticky-post slots for something like this, but this unscrupulous and inconsiderate person has left us no other choice.
