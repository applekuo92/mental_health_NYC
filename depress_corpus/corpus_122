Almost every time /r/depression gets mentioned in other subs (such as [this askreddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2wri29/which_subreddit_would_you_like_to_shake_some/cotkc4w?context=3)), people say how this place is "toxic" and that people here would rather talk about how depressed they are rather than ways to get better.

Think about that. They're literally condemning us for not being optimistic enough.

They claim they take depression seriously and how 'difficult it can be to face', but if you are so depressed that you're consumed by apathy and hopelessness, then they stop pretending to care and tell you to stop feeling sorry for yourself and to "go do something about it". It's like they think venting and looking for emotional validation and support is the worst thing a depressed person can do. *Obviously* being told a hundred times to exercise, go to a therapist, and meditate is the most helpful. *I was doubtful the first 99 times, but that last one sure changed my life!*

The worst part is that a lot of the time it's people who used to have depression saying these things. You know, those with the "if I can do it, so can you!" mentality-- similar to ex-smokers and ex-fat people in that regard.

It just seems like the more depressed you are, the less people want to help. And if they *do* try to help, they get angry if their advice and platitudes aren't met with anything other than gratitude and positivity. That's why I wonder if I should even bother opening up to my friends and family; knowing them, they'd do the exact same thing.

Sorry for the long rant. Perhaps a positive ending to counteract all that toxic nonsense: *Ahem*, I love all you guys so much! We got this as long as we believe in ourselves! WOO :DDD. ^^okay ^^let ^^me ^^throw ^^up ^^now
