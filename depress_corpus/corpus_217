I badly wanted to kill myself in the last few weeks. I even made arrangements. I wrote my last messages. I had prepared my goodbyes. I was set to go next Friday. 


Something struck me today. Yes, The girl I loved the most is no more. Yes, My career is a dead end. Yes, I'm fat and ugly. Yes, I might as well be dead. Yes, I may be clinically depressed. 

Despite all this, I realised might not have lost everything in my life. I did have Reddit to cling on to. I have snoo. I've been thinking and crying for the last few hours. and I'm crying as I type this. 

I want to put my life back together. I don't want my past to kill me. And so I'm making a promise.

Dear reddit, 

I will not let this decision fade away like last time. I will read this post every single day. I will relive every emotion I'm feeling now and put myself back on track every single day. I know you will always be there for me, even if nobody else will. You know what? Fuck them. I don't need anybody else. Only you can understand me. It's just you and me now. Let's do this shit. 




**Edit**: You people are so warm! Thank you for the overwhelming response. Really did not see this coming.

and to the redditor who "gilded"(whatever that does) this post: I really don't know how much you paid for this, kind stranger. What matters more to me is the fact that a person I don't even know, wants to encourage me in some way to get my life back on track. This post, this moment, is where I begin anew, friend. I will definitely not lose it from here. Thank you. Thank you so much. 

Will post an update in a week or two.
