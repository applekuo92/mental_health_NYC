I don't know if this the right sub for this, but watching this video broke my heart. Used to be subbed to this guy for his minecraft lets plays and seeing this pop up in my sub box hurt. He doesn't get any views so very few people are going to see his video. He needs some love and support :/

Edit: Damn guys.... Did not expect this response. 1000 views and 500 likes with hundreds of comments saying some of the kindest things I have read. Powerful stuff
