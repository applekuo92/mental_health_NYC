When nothing seemed to cross my mind -  
When silence passed the space behind -  
When conversations echoed dry,  
I didn't stop to ponder why.

*When days were lost attempts to hide*  
*The pointless hollow deep inside*  
*Where nothing found its feet and grew -*  
*I woke one day, and simply knew.*
  
I'd stepped my steps while others walked.  
I'd sounded sounds when others talked.  
I'd saved a smile to use at call.

I didn't feel a thing at all.
