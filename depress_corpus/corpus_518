For the past few months I just feel like I'm growing increasingly stupid. For example,  when I talk to people,  just every day chit chat, often my mind goes completely blank and I'm totally at a loss of what to say. In my mind,  my conscience struggles to form coherent sentences. It's like my vocabulary is shrinking. My thoughts are scrambled. I can't concentrate on anything. 
It's frustrating. Really frustrating,  because I can't escape it.
