I used to be an avid reader. I read between classes, during classes, during lunch, during dinner, until my eyes were shutting on their own at night. I loved being able to escape into a world of imagination and feeling like I had gained new friends. 

To this day, I still love books, but I can't read them. I have shelves upon shelves of books--unbroken spines and the weight of an adventure at my fingertips. I continue to buy them because I love the idea of being able to finally sit down and enjoy them. 

But I can't. I can get three pages in and my mind just wanders and the focus is gone. Reading is now a chore. It drives me nuts, because I want so badly to be able to sit and enjoy it. 

Eventually, I'll reach that point again. It's a very slow process, but my bookshelf needs the attention. I hope that I'll be able to embrace it.
