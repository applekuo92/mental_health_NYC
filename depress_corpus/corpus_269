I just feel like I'm weak some days. I'm good at hiding it but I always tell myself "maybe you're not depressed. Maybe you pretend to be this way" a lot. Am I the only one. Even when im fighting back tears, feel like dying, hoping that someone hits me on my motorcycle or just feeling like I have no energy because I feel completely drained after fighting it all day.
