Every interviewer is looking for someone happy, motivated and ambitious. Someone who fits the office culture. Someone who they like on a personal level and who seems like a catch in terms of their professional skills.

I am none of these things. I am flat out miserable and I can't hide it. You won't like me and I won't like you. I don't like anybody, especially myself. I'm not ambitious, not motivated, not fun, not nice and not someone you want to spend time with. I don't care about your company and I don't care about your job. I just need an income because I don't have the guts to kill myself.

I send out these resumes and I go to interviews and I try to pretend that I'm somebody else, but they can tell. My smile is so fake I probably look like a serial killer. I don't laugh. I stare blankly into blank walls. I can't even feign enthusiasm. 

I need a job. Desperately. But no one will hire me. Depressed because I'm unemployed, unemployed because I'm depressed. Can't get good jobs because recent work history is shitty. Can't get shitty jobs because less recent work history was pretty good. Overqualified for this, underqualified for that, with the tempermant of sour gas leak.

Everything only gets worse as time goes on. Nothing is working. There doesn't seem to be any way out.

What am I supposed to do?
