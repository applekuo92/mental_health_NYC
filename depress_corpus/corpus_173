We have a carefree childhood that eventually transitions into us working to save enough money so we can retire at a reasonable age and somewhat enjoy our last years ...

What fulfillment is there in that? Am I the only one who feels like we are glorified robots living out our days to its meaningless ends? It's like a "system" that is in place for us very few people possess the resources to deviate from it's influence. I barely have the motivation to get out of bed anymore.
