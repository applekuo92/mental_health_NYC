So I work the overnight at a corner store. I'm actually at work as I type this. 

Tonight a young man who said he was 19 called my store because he couldn't sleep and had noone to talk to. He said he was depressed and was having a hard time with life. I chatted with him for about 20 minutes about different things, he asked me for advice and at the end of the call thanked me for talking to him. His tone of voice seems much happier at the end of the call. 

I suggested to him that we grab a coffee sometime, he seemed like he wanted to but wouldn't take my cell number. I told him he could call any night to chat if he wanted. I really hope he does contact me again, he seemed like a really chill guy. He assured me he wasn't going to harm himself so I guess I have to take his word for it since he blocked the call.

Anyway I just needed to share this, not many people are awake for me to talk to right now. If you ever need someone to talk to, be it a friend or family member or just a random stranger over the phone. Please don't hesitate to do so. 

If anyone wants to chat on Reddit I'd be more than willing, I'm done work in two hours so hit me up.

Edit: I've got to head to bed for my shift tonight. I'll keep you posted if he calls again.
