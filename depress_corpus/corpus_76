I could never kill myself. I don't know if it's because I'm too afraid or because I care too much about my loved ones. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to go to sleep forever. I don't want it to be anyone's fault when I stop living. I just want to pass away, I just don't want to have to do anything anymore, I don't want to live in this circle of feeling pain and feeling empty anymore. Why is my heart so motivated to keep beating? Why can't it be like me, or I like it?

EDIT: Thank you for all your responses, experiences and thoughts. I didn't expect so many people to feel the same way, and it's a good feeling knowing that I'm not alone with these thoughts.
