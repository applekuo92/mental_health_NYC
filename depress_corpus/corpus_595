So yesterday was my 18th birthday. I made it.

When I fell into depression about 2 years ago, around 15-16ish I promised myself I would see to it my 30th birthday and if things weren't better by then I would end my life. As time I went on, I went from 30-25 then I dropped it to 20. 

Around Christmas I told myself I see my highschool graduation in June. About 2 months ago I set the date, my goal was my 18th birthday. 

I hit that goal and after accomplishing it, I think I'm ready to push onto graduation and the years ahead.

I'm not saying I'm cured because everday is a struggle. I have few victories but at least I have some right? If I killed myself the I would have never again be able to experience those small wins.

Sorry for ranting. Feels good to accomplish something, even it's just a minor win.
