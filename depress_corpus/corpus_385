I lie to my therapist. Sometimes I'm embarrassed. Sometimes I'm scared she won't like me anymore or she'll think less of me or judge me. Sometimes I don't want to admit things to myself or say them out loud. But therapy is fucking expensive and why the fuck am I going if I'm just going to sit there on her couch and be like, "Yeah, life is great. I'm a *little* stressed, but tomorrow's another day right? Right? Heheheheh." 

No more. Starting today I've made it a rule that I am not allowed to lie to her. I can choose not to answer certain questions or ask that we change the subject if I don't feel like talking about something, but I will not outright lie to her. If something is so hard to talk about that I can't say it out loud, I'll write her a note. 

And that includes being honest with her about the things she says and my thoughts on them. That includes telling her when I disagree with her or don't feel that her advice is helping me. That includes telling her how I feel when she says certain things. 

Hopefully by doing this, she can get a better idea of what needs to be worked on. Because she can't hold me accountable and call me out on my bullshit and teach me how to get my life together if I just sit there and tell her that I'm a *little* depressed, or that I don't think about suicide at all, or that I feel okay, or that I've been eating healthy and getting enough sleep. She needs to know. If she judges me for telling the truth then she's a shitty therapist and I'll find a new one. **I don't need her to like me. I need her to help me.**
