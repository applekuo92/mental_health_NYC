I'm at a point where I feel tired of trying. I feel worthless, I feel unlovable and after the last couple of months, I feel completely shattered. 

The same things happen over and over and I'm tired. I'm tired of wondering what I'm doing wrong. I'm tired of slowly opening up to someone intimately only after they've opened up to me first just to end up the one that helps them heal and eventually leave.

I'm tired of how bad it hurts. I'm tired of not being enough. I'm tired of people telling me how *strong* I am when I don't want to fucking be strong anymore. I'm tired of hearing my friends and family tell me that they love me and try to use that to make me feel guilty for feeling depressed and sometimes suicidal. I'm tired of it because when they say it even if I k ow they mean it it means absolutely nothing. 

They're not what I want. They're not who I want and I can't tell them that I honestly don't give a shit how they feel about me. It doesn't make me feel anything. 

I feel empty towards everyone and everything but one person. 

The things I cared about once don't ignite passion in me anymore. 

I could take my meds. I could talk to my doctor. I could schedule counseling. I know the drill. 

I just don't want to. I don't see a point anymore. 

I don't care. 

I'm not actively planning my death at least not today. I just don't care about my life. 

Someone tell me that makes sense. Please

Edit: Thank you guys. I've felt for so long that I couldn't voice or explain this because my loved ones just don't get it. If nothing else, it feels good to hear that other people understand. 

Edit: took a lot of pills tonight. Drank a lot. Thanks to everyone who understood. I just can't do it anymore. 
Thanks for the extra day.
