I don't really want to kill myself but I don't want to live either. I'm not happy, I'm not sad, I just am. I feel this quiet nothingness every waking second. I hardly eat anymore and I feel heavy. Are the antidepressants working?

I don't understand. I don't really care about my family. I have no friends. Man I'd love a good friend. I'd love someone to love me. I just want to vanish but I don't want to die and I've never felt anything like this before. Anyone get what I mean?
