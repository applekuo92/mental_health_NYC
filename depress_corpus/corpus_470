Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just making up the entire thing. Whenever I find myself enjoying something and being happy, I just end up thinking, am I really depressed? I'll look at people describing what depression feels like, find something I don't relate to, and immediately start doubting myself. Some people's depression seems to be much worse than mine, and it makes me feel like a fraud to be putting myself on the same level as them. It's like there's a "blueprint" for what a depressed person should feel and act like and if I can't fit perfectly into it, I'm not truly depressed, or I'm not depressed enough and shouldn't be complaining. Depression is like swimming against the current of a river, and whenever I find the occasional rock to hold onto or the current eases up, and I see others being sucked under, I start to doubt whether or not I should bother trying to pull myself out, or if I'm even in the river at all. 

This probably doesn't make sense, but it's been bothering me for a long time.

Edit: Thanks for the comments, they made me feel a lot better and I don't feel as alone knowing others feel the same. I have been diagnosed and I'm getting help (on medication, seeing therapist soon). This sub has been, and continues to be a tremendous help. So thank you all for the support, and good luck to those also struggling.
