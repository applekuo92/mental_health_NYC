It bothers me when people use this as an argument against committing suicide. They think they're helping but really they're just confirming what I already know. I know suicide is permanent. That's what makes it such an attractive option. They don't know if my problems are temporary and they shouldn't assume so. Just because eventually I may move out of my abusive father's house doesn't make the abuse any more tolerable. Just because my anxiety doesn't seem like that big a deal doesn't make it easier to live with. When I'm locked in my bathroom because I'm afraid someone is in my house even when I know that no one is, suicide looks pretty great. That's no way to live. My constant self-loathing sure isn't temporary. It's there every second of everyday reminding me just how worthless I am.

I realise that suicide is permanent. That's what I like about it.
