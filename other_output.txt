This is my fist post so please forgive any formatting errors, as I'm sure there will be lots.



I have an outstanding bill from Verizon wireless that has been sent to collections. One credit report dates this in April 2014 and another as opened this month. The amount owed is roughly  $1100.



I would like to know the best way to handle this debt, as i am trying to fix my credit after years of neglect. I don't know if the best option is to fight the bill, just pay it, or what else to do.



I have a few issues with this bill. At the time, my wife and I were going through a tough patch in our marriage. During this time I called my cell phone provider to ask them about changing my passwords and such to secure my account. Shortly after talking to them, I was notified of other changes to my account. My wife had called to make changes to the bill, gaining access to the account through the use of my SSN. I called the phone company back and was told there was nothing they could do secure my account because she new my SSN. At this point I transferred my account to a different company and did not pay the early termination fees. I feel that I didn't have a choice but to break my contract with them because they could not secure my account.



Thank you for taking the time to read this, and any advice or insight is appreciated.

Ask more questions than you make declarative statements.





Debates: If you spend more time asking questions than answering, who works harder to justify their perspectives you or your opposition? Do you want to levy disagreement without seeming pushy or brash; how could break down the points you disagree on while remaining open to input? Want someone to stop and seriously consider a point; how might you phrase that point to accomplish that goal?





People: Want to establish a rapport with someone, help them to remember you, or get information from them; what could you do conversationally to give them a positive impression or find out something from them? 

 



Work: Want to show your boss you're interested in their input, you want to do better, and are invested in things other that collecting a check? How would you most simply communicate this initiative to them? Want to show your employees you care about them as people and about their ideas, their concerns and needs? How might you elicit conversations on these points?





Women: Want a woman to take you seriously as personal prospect? How might you earnestly demonstrate how seriously you take her as a person & prospect (in that order)?





Boss: Want to generally be a boss in all social settings and engagements? How might you go about that?





Genuine people genuinely like it when you ask them about their thoughts and ideas, disingenuous people are disingenuously indignant about being questioned; might this be a useful social cipher?





If I went to fast for anyone, please, don't hesitate to ask questions.



EDIT: The above is an illustrative -- don't actually go around trying to be the Riddler. In conversations/arguments/etc. simply try to ask MORE questions than give declarative statements; most people can't actually ask that many questions in a row, it takes practice, but in conversation there will always be a back and forth.

So a plane is about to take off, and the first pilot does his typical announcements like "We'll be travelling at 35000 feet at a speed of...", you know, the whole routine. However, he forgets to turn off the speaker, so after the message, all the passengers hear him say to the co-pilot "You know what I'd really want now? A cup of coffee and a nice blowjob." So now, a stewardess is panicking and makes a run for the cockpit to make him turn it off. As she's running, one of the passengers say "Don't forget the coffee!"

So I'm going to start out by saying that this story terrifies me. It's not a very long story but I was told it when I was very young, so it freaks me out just the same.



So, when my grandma was a little girl she used to get these... feelings. For a long time she would only get good feelings before something good happened to her or her family, and then she started getting bad feelings. The first one she had was a few days before her mother was due to give birth to twins. 



The next day her mother went into labor and was rushed to the hospital. The feeling was making her shake back and forth, and she was crying while in the hospital waiting room. When her brother asked her what was wrong she couldn't explain what was wrong. The twins both died hours after being born.



My Grandma brushed it off as anxiety about the prospect of having two new siblings, and went on as usual. Then a few years later on a snowy, icy Sunday in December (we live in Wisconsin by the way) her family was all piling into the car to go to church, when she was struck with the worst feeling she had ever felt. It was a feeling of impending death. She screamed and cried and begged her family not to get into the car, and she refuses to get in. She was telling them they were going to die if they went out on the roads that day. 



Eventually her mother forced her to get into the car. She remembered saying, "Well I guess I'll meet Jesus today", in exasperation.



Her family didn't die that day, but when she got to school the next day she learned her best friends mom died in a car crash around the same time she had the feeling.



This is where she lost her power. She said it scares her so much she started going to church more and more and focusing on God and that her feelings slowly went away. To this day she strongly believes that the feelings were from the devil, and that she's better off without them.

I think I've fallen in love with Higuchi Ichiyo. If you're not familiar with her, she's a Japanese writer from the meiji era. She passed away very early in her life. Her only translated work is *In the Shade of Spring Leaves*. In includes a combination of her biography and auto-biography (an auto-biography of sorts -- she wrote a literary diary of her life). The second half of the book includes 9 short stories.

So recently I've found myself in a situation where I can no longer afford to wax my area. I love a smooth area, so I've been plucking it. The only annoying thing is that it seems like every few days more and more hairs are growing back!!! Is there something cyclical about hair removal? What kind of hair removal do you do? I've tried shaving but I hate the dark spots under my skin from the hair there, and I think it's rather itchy. I also don't have much exfoliation materials at home. Is there something I could DIY use, like a sock? (No sugar at home, but I do have salt...would that work?)



I hope it's appropriate to post this here!

I say this because I just watched "nosedive" the season 3 premier of Black Mirror and thought it was a wonderfully uplifting ending (in its own weird way). I'd also put six feet under's s2 premier episodes ending up there as well with Nate sitting on the beach with his father, realizing the beauty of life in his own realization of his mortality.

And frankly, I don't understand why people hate it so much.  It was fun, balanced the large cast well, and felt like a consistent and authentic extenuation of the original.  It was very pulpy and I expected as much, being that I enjoyed the original.  Was it corny?  Not so much as the first, but in spots, yes.  Was the action on par:  Yes.  Was the suspense on the same level?  Yes, but not until the end.  I really enjoyed it and hope they make a third.  What do you think?



Edit: To all that are downvoting:  I took the time to provide my reasons for enjoying the movie, can you do the same for your downvoting?  I'd honestly like to know the reasons why.

Think about it..  Have you ever felt like saying something but weren't sure if it would be taken the way you intended it?  The only way it can be not taken how you intended it is if you concede that it wasn't how you intended it.



So that is to say, if you just deny that you meant it any other way, you can always say exactly what you want exactly as you mean it.  



The trick to this is to firm the intention before you even say it, because if there's uncertainty in your voice as you say it, it will cast doubt on how you meant it.  This a strange phenomenon I notice in social interaction.  It's the "confidence effect," and it's quite simple.  The more confident you are in saying something, the less likely people are to challenge the nature of it.



I think this basic point can be applied to anything.  Hesitation is pointless, and maladaptive.  It literally screws things up, messing with our rhythm and flow.  My old baseball coach used to say, "if you're going to throw the ball away, throw it all the way away."  The lesson there was, if you're going to fail, fail!  Hesitation just screws things up.



From a pitcher's standpoint, this is why when guys get the yips, or a "disease" where they can't throw the ball anywhere near the target, the cause of it is overthinking and a complete lack of confidence.  The treatment is always psychological.  Well, sometimes the psychological effects cause physical mechanics to change, but that's besides the point.



Hesitation is the anticipation of failure.  Trust that you can do whatever you're trying to do.  If you fail, be surprised and learn from it, but don't let it discourage you or cause you hesitation on your next attempt.  Have confidence that this attempt will go well, so don't hesitate mid-attempt.   That is certain to only wreak havoc on the attempt.  Go all-in.



Honestly am I making any sense.

Please no EvE, I knows it is great but I have 2-3 hours every other day and I want new, beautiful, massive game play. Most recently I played/ragequit Archeage and play WarThunder and Planetside 2 (Live free or die), still, because they're great. Thanks!

Buckle up, this is a long one.



I recently started college after having taken a gap year, I'm a freshman. I've fucked up my reputation here and the year has only just started. This other freshman girl that I  had met and her group of friends, guys and girls, were going to a concert I was also attending. Her younger sister was also visiting that night and I'd introduced myself earlier that day when I'd seen the both of them on campus. The freshman girl and I had had a couple brief chats in the past, she was chill and all, we were both like "yeah, we'll see each other there" and all.



 So we do, we're both on the floor and schooboy q is performing and everybody's grooving and shit. her younger sister's arm was kind of brushing up against me and idiot cross-faded me, too fucked up to take into account the fact that the place was crowded and everyone was brushing up against one another, thought this was s a signal. Thinking I should reciprocate, I kind of feel at her hand. Big fucking mistake. She freaks out to her sister and their guy and girl friends: "he touched my hand!(...)" "(...)I'm scared (...)" one of the dude's was even like "he try to mess with you?!"  in my mind this whole time I'm just thinking "I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up". The the guys in the group kind of form a barrier to 'protect' the girls from me and it's all tension and bad vibes for the rest of the show. Even though we all had made plans to hit up a frat party after wards together, they leave the concert. The really shitty part is that even though I didn't have a lot of friends here tbh, I was just starting to get friendly with that whole group, and now that's been blown to shit.



For the longest time I was confused as to why they had the strong reaction that they did and felt bad for the shock I knew I had caused the sister. After a while however, I was mortified to find out that it's because the girl was 16. It also didn't help that I'm a 6'4" black dude. I've apologized and attempted to explain myself to the freshman girl, but she only pretends as though nothing has happened, making it impossible to have an honest dialogue about the whole situation. Though this is the case, the group from the concert has let it be known around campus that I am some sort of "creep" or "predator. Now, practically everyone i was friends with has started to avoid me. As a result, I have literally no friends in college, even though I've tried joining clubs and activities, even moving from one area of campus to another in an attempt to distance myself from them all and meet new people. Im also worried about this getting back to my hometown because a few people in the freshman class are from there. I never expected my experience here to be like this. I wanted to make new friends, meet girls and develop as a person. I was always  looking forward to college as a fun experience offering new and exciting opportunities to grow at every turn. So far it's just been a lonely and daunting experience. 



I'm not sure what to do at this point. Even though my plan is to transfer, I'm stuck here for the next 2 months and I've found the loneliness almost unbearable. It's been messing with my head and has began to depress me. It's pushed me to my limits and I feel helpless. I have no idea what to do.



tl;dr: I fucked up my social life at college in only the first week, having an awful time as a result. Don't know what to do.

Go to netflix(USA) and open up Burn Notice Season 4 Episode 19. Fast Forward to 7:58 and its the rock and roll song in the background. You only hear about 30 seconds of it.

I need help identifying this song. No matter what I tried shazam, music identifier, etc, I was never able to identify this song, and if you can please share the title and author of it with me.

2 of the 3 songs i've ever submitted here have been downvoted to 0. I don't mind that the songs i've written, recorded, and overall put a lot of work into might not be considered good, but having your post not making it past 30 minutes above 0 points kind of reduces its visibility. A lot.



I don't think I'm the only one noticing this either, considering a lot of posts I have looked at are showing the same results. Posts from other musicians that I've upvoted and interacted with also don't seem to make it past an hour of visibility at most (with exceptions of course).



Again, I don't mind if the general opinion is that I'm producing bad material. I just think the way this is working right now makes "Original Saturdays" kind of worthless for the entire sub.

This is by no means a call for a sequel to Ferris Bueller.  This is not accepting that Ferris is a Tyler Durden-esque construct of Cameron's mind.   How do you think Cameron's talk with his Dad went after crashing the Ferrari?  Did he stand up for himself?  Did his Dad punish him in any way?  Based on Cameron's character arc through the movie, how do you think he handled it?

There are some really great podcasts out there like Freakonomics, Stuff You Should Know, and Revisionist History. Podcasts seem to be in an era where there's high levels of competition to provide high quality stories and information. Seems like that's what journalism used to be. Now I feel like reading the news is worse then wasting time. Its like there's only an intent to increase clicks and likes. It seems to lead to misleading information. At least there's still a great source of news and stories.

I saw Psychonauts in a post and it reminded me of the time I tried and failed to get my boyfriend to play it.  We've been together 10 years and he still won't finish Legend of Dragoon. I used to joke about it being a marriage requirement. 



If you guys had to make completion of certain games a marriage requirement which games would you pick? Or to put it another way, what game do you feel your significant other needs to beat or they  couldn't possibly be right for you?

My mum and stepdad are big fans of Strictly Come Dancing and they both work, leaving me in the house on my own. Now they told me to record Strictly; which is fair enough. 



I was recording an episode of NCIS at the time and I forgot that both were recording at the same time so I clicked onto another channel, then a message popped up and I just clicked on the first one I saw, which was Strictly, not really reading the message. So I've only half recorded Strictly and now I'm worried that my stepdad and mum are gonna be fuming. :(

So, I built a [little end table](https://imgur.com/a/001BW) for myself and hot glued a bunch of caps on top. I want to do a pour-on tabletop, but I am not sure how to approach that with the vinyl magnet in the center. 



(I know, I know, yet another bottle cap table)



Should I glue the magnet down and take my chances with trapping air underneath it? Attempt to fill in the spaces between the caps first? This is my first time doing this, so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!



EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great advice. Several people recommended a test run and then a two-layer approach. I'm going to try going with that.

So this happened last night. I had just gotten on the train to head to the opposite side of the city. I knew this was going to be a very long train ride, so I brought along my rubiks cube. Over the past couple of years, I have become quite adept at solving these things and it tends to draw attention. Of course this being around 10 o'clock, there were a few drunk people around who were also a part of my audience. One of these people was a man with his wife and children, all of whom were mesmerized by my ability to solve this puzzle.



Here's where the fuck up begins.



After watching me solve the cube many times, the man informs me that it's making him dizzy. I kind of laugh this off thinking that he was just making a sort of off hand comment and I continue to solve it once more. When I showed him the solved cube, the guy looks at me dead in the eyes with the most blank stare. He then proceeds to stumble backwards, nearly falling over, grabbing his child to stabilize himself.



Then it fucking happens. The guy unloads a volley of vomit that would put a fire hose to shame - all over the head of his kid. Everyone around him just kind of stared at him holding his kid like he's a toilet bowl. Meanwhile, his kid just stands there in shock standing stiffer than a statue, no words. He just fucking took it. They got off at the next stop.



Tl;dr

I blew a guys mind with my Rubik's cube, he blew chunks on his kid.

Hey PF! Long-time lurker and fan! **I just finished paying down my student loans making me absolutely debt free!** I moved to a very rural town (Southeast Missouri) to work after pharmacy school two years ago so keep that in mind when I start rolling out the numbers.



* I make ~ 80K a year working 48 hours every 2-week pay period. I finished contributing the maximum to a 401K (65K total so far since inception) and Roth IRA (35K total since inception) just this week. I pay $300 a month for renting a house and I own my own car. I have 12k in liquid savings. My company matches some stock contributions (Walmart) and I have good health insurance.



* It's been about 2 years since school and I left with 60k in debt. I used a lot of the advice in this Sub to get to where I'm at now. It took a lot of discipline and budgeting and consistency.  I was also working full time right out of school so that I could pay everything down (I was making 133K at the time but rolled to part-time now because I want to have time for other things)



* Now I don't know what to do... I have a lot of excess income and I live in the middle of nowhere. I'll be able to continue to contribute the max to a 401K and Roth IRA, I'll still have no debt, and if my money situation changes I'll probably just get a raise.



Where do I put my excess money now? Thanks in advance

I was only nineteen years old when I met her. We’ve all been there – the first girl that gave us the time of day, the first girl (and certainly not the last) that we thought would be the one for us. To many of us, this first relationship would either be a learning curve or a laughing point in our personal histories, a running joke amongst friends intended to embarrass us about past antics. My experience was different however, and I mean this in neither a negative or a positive manner – what I experienced with my first love was entirely different to the stereotypical scenario.





When we first met, it was like dynamite. This girl was the ink to my paper, the pen to my pad and the star to my sky. I was Ted Mosby and she was Robin Scherbatsky; the fact that she understood this reference made me even more certain of our paths being intertwined. This was someone who not only understood my humour, but someone who would be prepared when I said something stupid to say something twice as dumb. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, and when I look back now I see this beginning period of our relationship as the happiest time of my life. I should have known back then, as with all relationships of this ilk, that this would never last forever.

Have you ever felt like you aren’t worthy of the happiness bestowed upon you? As if the current situation you find yourself within is too good to be true? Well let me tell you now – when something appears too good to be true, it usually is. This rule of thumb proved to be exactly the case in my situation, although maybe you’ll be luckier than I was. Our relationship didn’t end the typical way these young and passionate relationships did however, as two months into my stint with Georgie she was kidnapped.





That’s right – my girlfriend was kidnapped two months after our first date. As you can imagine, up to this point (and indeed afterwards) I found myself absolutely captivated and infatuated by this girl. She’d been the first girl to give me the time of day, and this wasn’t an opportunity I wanted to waste. I remember the day she went missing clearer than any other memory I possess. It was 3pm on a drizzly Thursday when I got the call from her mother asking if I had seen Georgie that day. I remember how I had struggled to hide my irritation on the phone to the girl of my dream’s parent, as she had been supposed to arrive at my flat for dinner hours earlier, instead stating calmly and respectfully that I had neither seen nor heard from Georgie, but I would let them both know as soon as I did.





The following days passed like a blur. Interviews with police and conversations with Georgie’s friends and families all seemed to blend into one distorted memory. I could remember no conversation clearly; my mind was jumbled and there was little to be done about that. All that remains clear in my memory is the dreams I had that first night when I heard the official news broadcast announcing her disappearance, and every night thereafter – the dreams where I saw Georgie screaming in agony, chained against a wall, her body contorted in an almost inhuman stance. This wasn’t any ordinary dream however; this was memory. Furthermore, she’d deserved this. This post is my confession – or rather, it’s the beginning of my confession. Behind the wall internet anonymity, this is the beginning of my admittance to everything I did to Georgie, from her kidnapping and the aftermath. This is my story. Welcome.

So naturally with adult life, comes some responsibility and recently employed. I decided that it's time for me to get a credit card and start building credit. I got a student credit card I've used only about 10% of what I can use on the card and don't plan on using it for the rest of this month. I tried to see when my payments would be do so I could make sure to have money in my regular bank account. Though it just says pending. I activated the card oct.23, and thought it was strange. I called the automated number and it said payment is not required this billing period. What does this mean? Does it mean from Oct to Nov or all the way to December?! Kind of confused. Also any other advice is appreciated, I generally know how they work pay in full on time, don't go over 30% of the cards limit, spend on small items not on large.

I was wondering the other day, if IMDbPro is worth subscribing. Anyone around here has a subscription? What kind of information do you have access to?



I know I can get that information on IMDb website, but I figured it would be better if I read some opinions of those who actually have a subscription on it, so they can share their experiences.

Some time ago, a medium contacted Hitler's spirit by accident. Out of curiosity, he decided to listen to what Hitler had to say.



"Listen to my words, you little brat: I'm gonna reincarnate someday, and I'm gonna kill six million Jews and two dogs".



"Why the two dogs?" the medium replied.



"See, nobody cares about the Jews!"

Hey guys! I have a relationship issue that I just need some insight because lately I've been going crazy and I know I shouldn't be feeling like this. 



Some background, my boyfriend and i have been dating over a year(7 months of dating but exclusive, and 6 months officially if that matters) and lately i realized that he's been snap chatting a girl quite frequently. I brought it up to him that i saw that he's been snap chatting her and he said that she's just a friend and i told him it made me feel a little insecure because i never heard of her before and we talked it out and assured me it wasn't a big deal because he would never do anything to betray me (side note i asked if he was emotionally invested in her and he said no she is a friend).



So a month goes by and I'm over it, so i thought, but i realized the other day that me and him aren't each others #1 best friends anymore but him and the girl are each others #1 (depicted with a yellow heart) and it makes me feel completely uneasy about the situation. 



So where i need your guys' help, should i bring it up again and how without sounding like I'm crazy, or should i just let it go because i even know its not a big deal because its just social media. 



Side note, my boyfriend has been cheated on in the past and I know he wouldn't cheat because he knows first hand what it feels like, but apart of me feels as if this girl has feelings for him and he's oblivious to it. 



I feel like this is a childish thing to be jealous of, especially for someone in their mid-twenties, but it being my first serious relationship I feel as if i don't know how to act on these feelings.

I notice music can often be described with a mood, such as 'uplifting' or 'sombre'. Suppose two people listened to a particular mood of music for the first time in their life, would they be in agreement of what kind of mood that music created? Is it possible for someone to listen to 'uplifting' music and feel personally that it is 'sombre'?

Last night I watched Deliverance and Dazed and Confused (odd combo, I know). During the scene in Dazed where O'Bannon is giving licks to Herschfelser, he makes him squeal like a piggy, similar to the assault scene in Deliverance. Dazed is set in 1976, Deliverance came out in 1972, so it's possible the characters would be familiar with it. Anyone else notice this? Thoughts?

Hi all,



We all know about IGN, Kotaku, Polygon and even the smaller bigger sites like VG24/7, Rock Paper Shotgun and Destructiod but I wanted to see if you follow any other smaller websites.



My thoughts are sites like:

*[goodisageek.com](http://goodisageek.com)

*[videogamesuncovered.com](http://videogamesuncovered.com)

*[gamerant.com](http://gamerant.com)

*[nintendoeverything.com](http://nintendoeverything.com)



Would be great to see some more! Also be interested to see why you go to those particular smaller sites you read.

The moon illuminated half of his face, transforming him into a creature I can only describe as an angel of vengeance- beautiful, and at the same time scary. His magnificent gaze bore down on me, and I couldn’t help but notice how even when his beautiful face is contorted in rage- rage directed at me, even when he has blood- my blood, splattered over his white designer tees, even when he is breathing so hard , exhausted from repeatedly ramming his fists, he still looks perfect. So, maybe he is a monster, but he is also my husband, and I love him.



My name is Rose, and maybe I’m a victim of domestic violence, but, I don’t think of it as that. I love my husband very much, and he makes me really happy. Everything he does is for my sake, and I know. Every time he corrects me, he does so because this is all I understand, and I believe that every time he corrects me, I deserve it.



I remember this one time he came to pick me up from work, and he drove us straight to the airport. I didn’t have my passport, or luggage, but he had thought ahead, anticipated all of that. Our two weeks together in Abu Dhabi was the best two weeks of my life. He showered me with so much love and attention that it was almost overwhelming. He said he wanted us to spend some time together, just us- no cell phones, no pagers, just us. Boy was it magical!



So, what if my beautiful man transforms into a monster when I say “no” to him? What if he takes me to hell with his fist when dinner isn’t ready in time? What if he decides to have his way forcefully when I tell him I’m dead beat at night from a long day at work? What if?? He gets his down days too just like everyone. It did say for better for worse in our marriage vows.



Now, I’m sitting in a hospital bed, yet again. I must have passed out at some point, I don’t remember. The doctor just left, staring gravely at my patient file. He asked me how I sustained my multiple fractures- some healed, others not, and the bruises on my face. I told him I tripped and fell down the stairs. I watch CSI, I know he doesn’t believe, I don’t really care.



It’s usually a different hospital every time. My fear is that at this rate, we we’ll run out of good hospitals in the city.



I know from experience my love will come see me. He will apologize, and with tears in his eyes, he will admit to me how he has anger issues, and he will swear to me that he will work on himself- for my sake, for our sake. He will sign my discharge papers, and he will stretch out his hand for me to take. Hope and fear will chase each other across his face, while he waits for me to make up my mind. It’s almost as if his very existence depends on my answer. With his hand outstretched, he will say “Let’s go home baby”, and while the doctors and nurses look on, with disapproving looks on their judgmental faces, as if to say “No, don’t go with the monster”. He might be a monster, but he is my monster. So, I’ll take his outstretched hand, smile at him and say “It’s about time”



And the cycle begins again.

So a few friends and myself decided to go see a movie,in the theater there was this couple, around the age of 18 or 19, before the movie they were they were messing around and the guy was trying to be cute and he said "baby you're one in a million"..........



I immediately responded with "statistically that means there's more of you"



She then looked at me, then looked at her date and said "he has a point, who else is one in a million to you huh!?"

10 minutes of arguing later she leaves, he chases after her and neither return for the movie.

I am a fairly squeaky clean new player to the battlefield universe. I have always liked first persons but never played battlefield at all. I have a high regard for WWI and lost it when I found out a new game was in the making. I preordered buy have been lookin into building a team. All if my mates are on steam and so being the only one who owns the game I wanted to see if any of you nice people wanted to have some fun together.

I tried to talk him out of it, but he jumped anyway. Luckily the trampoline emporium was having a sidewalk sale that day, and he landed on a trampoline and bounced all the way back up to the too if the building and said something to me

While reading about the recent DDoS news, I followed a rabbit hole which discussed a bunch of different shady companies, and related people, who were using supposedly hijacked IP ranges. One of these ranges was 1.3.3.0/24 so that the hijacker can throw up a "greets" page on 1.3.3.7 (get it?) I'm just wondering if ARIN, APNIC, RIPE, etc actually allocate the ranges, how can someone just hijack and keep them?

All those adults doing boring stuff. In the end its all for our children! I want to see a two year old screeming about bedtime while doing quadruple somersaults. What toys will they play with? Magnets? Imagine being 10 years old again in a bouncy castle in zero G.



Thats an idea that science fiction left untouched. The fun of not having to care about crucial missions and honor and danger. Just a child running on the capsule walls playing catch screaming and laughing.



Can you imagine the fun of throwing those jumping rubber balls? What about rc toys? 



Please tell me what you would play in zero G. I can't stop daydreaming.

Excuses for my bad English, I'll do my best.



This happened a couple weeks ago. I had a pretty bad cold (not any fever or anything, just headaches and a sore throat and coughing up a lot of slime) so I stayed at home from school. I decided to lay on the couch while my mom was going somewhere with a friend of her. After a couple hours I was bored so I decided to start fapping (I didn't feel that bad). I didn't have anything near me to dump my load in except a cup with a little water left in it. I decided to use it and said to myself that I would wash the cup right after I would be finished. This is where the fuckup started



After I finished I was so stupid enough to put the cup back where it was. I know that I was being stupid but I really didn't feel like coming of the couch. Then my mom comes back and starts a conversation with me. She decides that she'll be nice to me and clear the little table next to the couch. She picked up the cup and DRANK WHAT WAS LEFT. You could see on her face that the stuff she drank wasn't exclusively water and she asked what it was. I'm completely fucking shocked and I'm just able to say that it was some slime that I coughed up and spitted out. She was extremely disgusted and got pissed at me. I just wanted to kill myself that moment but I think I handled the situation pretty well by telling her that she drank some of my spittle than some of my semen.

We're all descended from a direct and personal ancestoral line dating back to the first single cell organisms on Earth. You, me, and everyone I know is the result of this unbroken chain. For me to not reproduce would not only mean I'm the first in my direct ancestral human line not to, but also the first in a direct line dating back to those early single cell organisms. 



Trippy...

For my entire life I've been ambitious but I have one serious problem that holds me back.



Whenever I achieve something big (although it's not always that big), I'm so happy and I feel so proud that I lose any motivation to do further work or improve myself.



I believe it is because I feel so important and feeling important is the main need of human.



I've been trying for few years to overcome this problem and I didn't succeed, help.

And a stunning gorgeous woman seats by his side. He's the eager to start a conversation.



"So, what are you doing in Paris?"



"I'm a scientist, I research sex"



The man is now tempted:



"What have you discovered about sex in your research?"



"I came to find that Native Americans have the longest penises and Spanish can last the longest in bed. By the way, I'm Carol, what's your name?"



"I'm Sitting Bull Hernandez, nice to meet you"

What is the meaning of song "Super Taranta!" by Gogol Bordello?



This song is connected with their other song "Supertheory of Supereverything", which is song about guy who reads Bible the first time and starts thinking that God "doesn't have sense of humor".



"Super Taranta!" lyrics are:

"Second time I read the Bible

I was thinking, 'It's alright, man'

I was thinking najdedajdaj

I v dushe vse na gitarkah



Ai, ai, shadows of forbidden existence

Come with me, to the future now!"



What's that mean? It is suppose to be pro-religion song?

I feel like people mainly associate flasks with keeping drinks hot, even though most flask manufacturers also state how long they can keep drinks cold. 



Filling up a flask with water and a few ice cubes (or just a cold drink to start with) can keep your drink cold all day despite being handled. Much better than plastic bottles. Only drawback is flasks are a bit bigger than their plastic counterparts for the same capacity, so it might not be useful in every situation, but it's good for gym sessions, picnics etc.

**Than is for comparing.**



e.g.



* That dog is bigger and meaner than this dog.

* Those trees are more realistic than those hedges.

* A wise word is better than an ostrich feather. 



**Then is a precursor for an event.**



e.g.



* Then she said, "balloon."

* Then I got eaten by a wasp colony.

* Then the tornado cried.





**Double Trouble**





* If you are less capable of remembering this than me, then look it up. 

* 

* When the moon is bigger than the earth, then I'll move there.

* 

* If the polar ice caps are hotter than my bathtub, then I'll bath there.

I wanted to provide some films for some little little kids, but I want them to be super simple enough to follow (heck, when I was little, I couldn't even gather in A Bug's Life that the grasshoppers were forcing the ants to split their food), so what I'm looking for is something that expresses most of its simple concepts visually. 



Fantasia so far is the only one I've thought of.



Something black and white would be great to introduce to a young child as well. A silent movie in a Charlie Chaplin kind of spin.

I'm 20 years old. I'm going to graduate college with no debt (parents paying) and have no other debt at the moment. I may go to grad school, but I'm not sure yet.



I have no money in my retirement account, so should I put the 2K in there? Or should I invest it? Or should it just stay where it is?

This happened several years ago when I was 17 and still in high-school. I went to one of those fancy, private girl schools where your skirt had to be knee-length and you got detention for not wearing a ribbon in your hair. We also all had our own laptops (provided by the school) to work on. Now obviously the school internet blocked access to Facebook, Twitter, etc. They also had a v. sensitive keyword function, which blocked a whole bunch of websites, even fairly innocuous ones - I once couldn’t access a site about marijuana even though it was part of an assignment for Health class. 





*ANYWAY.* 





We all knew the school had these stringent internet blocks, so most of us never fucked around with it at school, bc we couldn’t access sites even if we tried. When I was at home though, I was able to get onto all the sites with no problem. Duh, because it’s my home internet and not the schools. All safe. Being the average, hormone-riddled teen I was, I was a frequent porn-watcher and my curious mind would take me click after suggested click, out of sheer curiosity. 



One day, I’m pulled out of my study period to meet with the Headmistress. Now this woman was the lovechild of Professor Umbridge and the White Witch of Narnia. I’d never seen her smile or laugh in the entire time I was at the school and being called into her office was not a good sign. 



I try to play it cool and friendly. Who knows, maybe I was called in to be told I was getting an academic excellence award at the next assembly. Maybe the Head Girl got mono and I’ve been chosen to step up. But after looking at her icy scowl I know this can’t possibly be the case. She makes me sit down and without saying a word, slides over 10 printed pages (stapled) across the desk. I pick them up to take a look and I feel like I’ve just swallowed a glacier. In my hands are several pages of adult websites I’d visited over the semester, with the names of the videos followed by a url and the date / time accessed. 



Sitting across from this woman and reading titles like ‘busty babysitter gets punished by thick cock’, ’double penetration rough gangbang’, and ’stepbrother seduces young sis’ was too much for me to handle. I try to make some flimsy excuse about some male friends coming over and hacking my laptop. But this is not true. The pages clearly show consecutive days of porn-access for weeks, all around the 11PM-1AM timeslot. That would have to be some pretty persistent hacking. 



She tells me to leave her office, never do that again, and to take the wad of papers with me. I walk back down the school corridor feeling like I’m holding a stolen handgun, needing to find a bin out of sight to shred up the evidence of the embarrassing moment of my teenage life. I soon realised that the school had in-built software to track activity on their laptops, even if we weren’t connected to their internet. Couldn’t bring myself to even think about watching porn for a good 6 months after that. Sometimes I still have flashbacks to those pieces of paper.  



**TL;DR** watched porn at home on a school computer without realising it was being monitored, got caught out by the headmistress, still cringe four years later.

This world never seems like enough for many of us. Maybe that's why so many people suffer from depression for no good damm reason,  because they subconsciously realised there is supposed to be MORE, but become dissatisfied at the realization it will never be found in this life or in this world.

... when the plane crashes, and they are stranded in some desert. Fortunately they survived with only small injuries. These Christians, John and Steve, start walking under the heat of the desert sun. After a few hours, they see a mosque in a distance. John wanted to make a plan.



**John**: Let's go to that mosque, disguise ourselves as Muslims, and asks the Imam to spare us some food and water. I'm gonna call myself Ahmed.



**Steve**: No, I don't want to disguise myself as Muslim. Sounds like a bad idea...



**John**: Alright... If you don't want to disguise yourself then fine. Let's just go.



John and Steve walk to the mosque. John opened the conversation with the Imam



**John**: Salaam Alaikum, Imam. My name is Ahmed. This is my friend Steve. We are travelers and our plane crashed...



**Imam**: MashaAllah! Come on in Brothers! Let me get your friend Steve here some food and drinks.



**Steve**: Oh my god, Thank you. Thank you very much!



**Imam**: ... and for you Ahmed...



**John**: Yes, Imam?



**Imam**: Ramadhan Mubaraak!

My son recently turned five and I've decided to give him an allowance of $10/week. To 'earn' the allowance he has to try hard, behave well at school since his 'job' is to learn. 



I worked with him to set a budget $2 to savings, $1 to charity, $5 for fun and $2 for gifts (Christmas, birthdays, and the like).



This is similar to how my father did my allowance as a child and I used a check book that he didn't need. I do everything online and eventually I'd like him to track it via a spreadsheet or mint. But to help him learn math, I'd like him to initially do the math by hand. 



Does anyone have suggested (already built) printable spreadsheets for something like this? I can fairly easily build my own. But, I figure people must have already done this.

A man emerged from the shadows and said, "Hello there Ry...Time to die.  Hey there Ish... Gonna feed you to the fish. You are both very bad...So this won't be so sad."



He approached them and said, "Sack smack!". And back handed them both in their testicles. "Dick kick!" Said the man. And punted them both in the groins. 



This continued for a while. The bizarre torture and rhymes getting worse each time. "Glass in your ass!", Stab stab! "Glock to the cock!" Bang bang! "Hot coals in your holes!" Sizzle, sizzle! 



Finally the man ripped off their gags. "Who are you?!" Ryan screamed. "Why are you doing this!?"



"I know who it is!" Said Ismael. "It's Pum, the poet torturer! He kidnaps and mutilates people for money! I'm sure someone hired him to do this!"



"You don't know my game...And that's not my name." Replies the man. "For you, no money was spent... Ry I'm 'Pun', Ish meant."



Pun explained, "It's just us...poetic justice."

I'll be quick and honest. I got myself in a bit of a sticky situation, something I've been slowly fixing and learned from (I learn things the hard way apparently), and I desperately need advice.



Basically I recently changed my Credit Karma information so it's now in my changed legal name. I tried months ago but it wouldn't let me and I completely forgot until last week. Today I logged on and my 659 and 647 scores dropped to below 560 each. My new high is 554. I looked around and realized it's cause two bills I had sent to collections, that were in my legal name, were now added to the Credit Karma account because it was in my old name and that's why they never showed up.



So now I have two bills, under $500 each thankfully, showing up and I don't know how bad this will effect me. Luckily I'm young and have time, but I'm also young and inexperienced and family is a terrible place to go as most of them have scores worse than me. And a financial advisor (was recommended one) costs money I currently don't have. So I'm here.



I do have some specific questions about how I could maybe fix this, so can you help a kid out?



1) Will my score improve the same or better if I pay the bills off in full?



2) When (not if) I pay these off, how long will they stay on my account?



3) Will my score EVER go up to pre-collections status even if I pay it off, or at least half?



4) Is there any way I could get them off my account after paying them off?



5) I am about to start paying off the local university I went to, will that show up on my account if it's going directly to the school?



6) My credit card is showing up, finally, and it's showing the balance and everything. With that being my ONLY good means of credit, how long will I be screwed in trying to apply for an unsecured card? I will point out it sure as hell won't be for a long time now, but an approximate time would be nice.



That's about all I can think of asking. I would seriously appreciate ANY advice. I got myself in this mess, I am aware of that, I gotta get myself out someway. But if the questions above can be answered, I'd appreciate that a lot more than you know. If you need any more info, feel free to ask.

Are there any tv shows where there was a big twist, and then later in the series said twist turns out to not be as know it and there's a twist on that twist? A possible example: finding out the main character is imagining another character we thought was real, and then later finding out the main character is actually the imagination of the supposed imaginary character who we now find out is real.

I have a job where I am paid a lot of overtime in the spring and my hours are cut considerably in the summer.  My boss suggested that I "bank" the overtime hours from the spring so that I'll still get paid in the summer.  But, he said those banked hours would not be paid at overtime rate.  



From what I understand that is not legal?  I am a non-exempt employee of a private company in a state that does not have its own employment laws, so we fall under the FLSA rules.

The heat is on in more ways than one, and Natasha can tell that Sergey is getting close. She tries to stop him and ask, "Do you have protection?", but it's too late.



Two months later, Natasha is late, so she takes a pregnancy test. Sure enough, she's pregnant. In tears, she tells her parents. They ask how it's possible. "It's an accident!" she swears.



Her father goes and finds Sergey and demands he handle arranging the abortion. The communist government had heavily restricted abortion, however, and so Sergey had to bribe doctors to try to perform the procedures. He tried and tried, and several doctors were willing, but yet the procedure was never successful. No matter what the doctors did to try to terminate the pregnancy, the child lived on.



Finally, in desperation and losing faith in the Russian healthcare system, Sergey took out a loan and flew himself and Natasha to Paris to try one more procedure. Finally, this one was successful.



After the procedure, Sergey asked the doctor, "Why were all the efforts in Russia unsuccessful, but yours wasn't?"



The doctor replied, "You see, in Soviet Russia, accident survives you."

The last time I had sex was 2 months ago, before my last period and I had an IUD at that time. However, at the end of my last period a month ago, my IUD ended up coming out. 



...And now my period is 6 days late.

I've tested 8 different times (the most recent being two days ago) and they've all been a hard negative.



Should I be freaking out or is this normal? I'm deathly afraid of being like one of those girls in "I didn't know I was pregnant" and suddenly popping out a "miracle" baby.

So I got into a conversation about how reality show winner rarely make it big in the industry even though they won. I brought up the point that winners rarely last longer than most one in wonders in general. So I got to wondering "what percentage of artists only chart once?"



I think to be fair, the percentage I'm looking for doesn't necessarily mean they hit the top 40 only once, but they came and went relatively fast. So an artist can have 2-3 songs on the chart at once, but then is never heard from again. 



What do you guys think? What would you say is the odds of a reality show winner staying relevant compared to a typical artist who rose naturally? Anyone read any solid study on how fast that revolving door of talent is?

So im 3/4 way through install and have all the wall tiles set. I used durock for the walls but didnt use a waterproof membrane over the top, just thinset and tile. I will not be tearing the walls out to redo them as this is way too costly. I am installing a pan liner to trap any water on the floors though. What is my prognosis on stability long term? Will my wall tiles fall off eventually from moisture penetration? What are any other concerns i should have?

I am currently using an app called spending which is working great but it's only on my phone so each time my wife buys something, she either has to give me the receipt or tell me what she bought and how much it cost. There has to be an app out there that my wife and I can both put on our phones that links together so we can each enter expenses in and it updates on both phones. Does that exist? I don't like mint so is there anything else out there?

Hi, recently my bank switch over from First Niagara to Keybank. I really dislike how the switch happened, all of my online banking is unavailable for an unknown amount of time. Another thing I dislike is that they are closed on Saturday's. My question is what bank is best for me? I'm a 20 year old, living on my own and in college. I have two jobs, both of which I can use direct deposit. Thank you

Johnny was sitting in class and after everything the teacher said he'd reply "how bout that". "2x2 equals four" said the teacher, "how bout that" said Johnny. "In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue"  the teacher explained "how bout that" said Johnny. Well it wasn't long and Johnny was sent to the hall. After a while the teacher went out to get him and asked Johnny if he had learned his lesson. "yes said Johnny and I wrote a poem while I was out here" The teacher wanted to hear it and so so Johnny recited "when I was in the hall I saw a cockroach go up the wall" . That's very good said the teacher I would like you to recite your new poem to the class, but leave the cock out it's offensive. Soon Johnny was standing in front of the class and he began his poem "when i was in the hall I saw a roach go up the wall, with his cock out. How bout that!"

So the deal is I busted my ACL/meniscus playing basketball back in college about a year ago but I've graduated now and will be starting a new job in a Hospital full time with great benefits like medical.I've done some research on my town that I should go with a low deductible plan to lower the cost of the impending surgery I plan to have on my knee 6 months after I begin working. 



My question is it better for me to disclose the pre-existing condition(torn ACL/ Meniscus) when they do my physical assessment and medical history for the insurance plan? 



Or should I could not disclose it and pass their physical/questionnaire easily and slowly bring to their attention that I am having knee pain and have the surgery done 6-7 months after employment? 



Can they look into any past medical history I've had along with doctor visits? 



Lastly, is a low deductible plan the best for someone looking to have surgery soon?

So I have a USB phone charger cable that hasn't been working properly. The drawing tablet that I use the cable for kept disconnecting even at the slightest of movements to the wire, and to rectify I had to remove and reconnect the cable. I had to do this everytime and I got fedup. I thought maybe some dust or whatever was doing something to the device connecting end of the cable and so I took a needle and started rubbing it across the inside of it. By doing this my HD that was connected to the adjacent USB port disconnected and reconnected a couple of times. Apologies if it's not the right sub.

I am the only women in senior management in a startup tech company.



I have always loved to cook and bake, and have never really had much of a sweet tooth myself.  As such, I've been bringing food, generally baked things, to my jobs for the better part of 15 years.  Even when I worked in restaurants, I would bring in stuff I made- I lived alone and could never finish it all.



My husband brought up last night that I may consider stopping this behavior at my current company given my recent promotion.  He pointed out that there have been many articles written that show that coworkers may perceive women who bring food to share as being more matronly and nurturing, both of which (apparently?) negatively impact the perception of someone's authority in leadership.  



This honestly never occurred to me.  It breaks my heart to think that I should stop a behavior that I enjoy immensely and that I believe my colleagues also enjoy because of some backwards, old-school idea of a "woman's work", but I am also struggling to get my "place at the table" in our management structure in this specific company.



What are your thoughts, twox?  Is this one of those situations where we say "fuck the patriarchy" in the same way that I wouldn't cut my hair short to be perceived as more traditionally masculine, or is this a more nuanced thing that I should be sensitive to given the fact that I am already under the microscope in this position (I am not only the only woman in senior management in a tech role, but I am the only woman in management at ALL at this 70+ person company.)



(as an aside- my husband is NOT stating that he thinks I should stop bringing in the snacks.  I don't want twoX to jump all over him for planting these ideas in my head- he has been my biggest champion in fighting for my "right to parity" within an industry and company which are not friendly to women.  I think he was honestly surprised that I had not considered this previously.)

If you're a teacher and you have a 403(b), or you're thinking about starting one, this is a must-read.



http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0



It's about how 403(b)s aren't regulated as strictly as 401s are, and as a result, the fees are much higher than they ought to be. In the end, it can be a difference of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.



Please help me get the word out.

Hi!  

I am 26 years old Norwegian, and trying to be more financially independent.   

  

  

My situation  

I have a good emergency fund  

I have 36k (USD) in studentloans with a fixed 2.5% interest rate (next 10 years).   

I can easily save 2k (USD) a month, while living fairly comfortable.  

I currently have 12k saved up.   

  

  

Additional information:  

I do not need health insurance, health care is free in Norway  

Unemployment gives me most of my salary for a few years.   

Permanent unemployment due to sickness gives me 66% of my salary permanently  

Retirement at 62-65   

  

  

I am considering renting insted of buying for the next 10-15 years.  

Current housing interest is 2.5-3%,  

Price of renting is 1.5k for a 300k apartment  

Renting makes it easy to scale the housing based on current needs.   

Moving does not incur a loss of about 12k for selling the house, and lots of stress.   

  

  

Question 1:  

- Should I rent and invest or buy?  

- Where should I put my money?  

  

  

Without knowing much about diversification I was thinking of something like this:  

20% - Bonds  

   

  

80% stocks with:   

    20% in my country (OSEBX - Norwegian index)  

    40% S&P 500  

    40% MSCI  

  

  

I hope anyone can help me and give me some good advice!

While I expect the title to scare some people off and garner anger in others, if you are willing to follow along I hope to have some worthwhile discussion. Instead of my 10th discussion on the day about suggesting a first credit card or how to pay off student loans, I figured this might be a good topic to have. 



For what must be the 100th time, I saw [this](https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png) posted in this sub again today. It is repeated again and again around here that IRA and 401k maxing should occur before taxable savings, before ‘frivolous’ spending on items such as vacations and cars, and before prioritizing other spending in the short-term.  *“But have you maxed your IRA/401k already??”* is a response to nearly all questions related to spending money. 



I was encouraged that a few people shot back and disagreed over these posts I have seen, but this isn’t always the case.  Retirement savings are great, there is no questioning that, but charts like those aren’t always helpful.  While they sometimes apply, I hate that they have become blanket advice.  I, personally, have no desire to max my 401k. I save about 10k/yr in it, even though I know I could save more (the whole 18k) if I wanted. I’d like to share my reasoning on the topic, and maybe why you should feel the same way. 



First off, for many people saving 18k pre-tax and 5.5k post tax (and double for couples) is not remotely an option.  However, lets pretend it is for a moment. Let’s say we have a couple that makes $80k/yr (40k/each).  Each adult maxes both their Roth IRA ($11k) and 401k ($36k) but has no other long-term savings. They each have a 6-mo emergency fund (12-mo total) and stable jobs. While they live comfortably, they never have much extra money for vacations, leisure, and fun. They cook cheaply, own cheaper cars, and live minimally. However, they feel good about themselves because they have always been taught to save, save, save. Let’s say they first start saving out of college at the age of 25, and save until they are 62 when they happily retire earlier than many.



At age 62, they will have 3 main sources of income. Their Roth IRA, 401k, and Social Security. We can argue over the longevity of SS if you wish, but for this example, it will be around with similar benefits as today. Not ‘expanded’ nor 'cut' as is usual political discussion.  The happy couple stuck to their plan and saved 18k and 5.5k each every year. This is rather ‘conservative’ as the contribution limits will certainly rise in the next 40 years, but lets pretend they won’t and they still contribute 18k all the way until they retire. To make up for that, let’s say they each have a 2% match from their employer. Nothing extravagant, but certainly helpful. Here is how much money the couple with have at age 62 (assuming generic retirement calculations):



Pre-tax 401ks: $6.7M



Post-tax Roth IRA: $1.9M



SS (Assuming 25-year post retirement life of both spouses): $1.3M





Now to get this all back to pre-tax, lets say you paid 20% effective tax on Roth IRA contributions. This is certainly reasonable since it is money off your highest income bracket. That then becomes about $2.4M (1.9/0.8) leaving you with an effective value of $10.4 million pre-dollars for retirement at age 62, all pre-tax. Conservatively drawing 4% of your retirement funds + SS will leave you with ~$415k/yr of income. 



Now clearly this is in future money. The numbers I have used will occur in 2052. So we must calculate how much money that is today to get a real grasp on it.  Using 3% inflation/year we track back to today’s dollars of  **$145,000**. 





So next time before you tell someone who is really excited about their first home, their first nice $15k car, or ‘blowing’ $5k on a trip to Europe to live their dream that they shouldn’t do it, ask yourself this. Will they really need $145k/yr  (in 2016 dollars) at retirement? After all, that's nearly double what our hypothetical couple is making. And should they sacrifice those unneeded expenses today to be very well off in the future with maybe less reason to spend due to health concerns and aging?



Happy Saturday, enjoy your food for thought. I’d love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to pick apart the math, tell me I don’t understand something, or whether you tend to agree and wish people placed less stress in the sub about ‘maxing accounts’ and more on letting the many 20 something asking for advise live a little. Cheers.

I remember during the 04 ALCS/World Series, I was too young to stay up for the entire games because of school the next morning (I was 9 at the time). I would wake up to a note taped to my door on the results of the game from the night before with stats and highlights of the game from my father. During game seven of the ALCS however I remember staying up for the entire game and then again for game four of the World Series. I still remember the goosebumps I got, That was the first time I realized how much joy a sport could bring someone.

Want to be able to have a conversation with friends online without completely shutting out my kids.

All the ones I've gotten under $25 have broken within a couple months but can't find anything more expensive(which, one would assume, would last longer).

Any suggestions?

My understanding is that NAFTA is a free trade union that eliminates most tariffs. My understanding is also that the TPP would do the same.



How do American tariffs work ? How high are they? My understanding is that states that have 'most favored trade status' have lower tariffs than those that dont. 



When people try to sell the TPP they state that tariffs are so low already signing this agreement will not have any negatives on us. We are gaining access to markets. If that was the case I do not see why other states would lower their tariffs on our goods in a free trade union. What do they get out if it? If out tariffs are already so low that it does not impact trade than there is nothing in it for them.  



What other trade restrictions other than tariffs would the TPP changed? 



This question is about more than the TPP. Its about how American tariffs work and hiw much they would be reduced with the TPP.

Following up in literally any capacity is easy, and really means a lot. Some examples: Did you help someone with an issue at work? A week later a quick email "hey just a follow up so I can scratch you off of my list. Is *issue* still working ok?" Or when I was working for myself as a field tech. Help a customer and do a good job, they'll remember you as good. One succinct follow-up call a week later and they'll remember you as stellar. The effort/return ratio here is astounding; it's so easy and it means so much to people. In my current capacity if I ever help ANYONE with an issue I always follow-up and I genuinely feel everyone appreciates it. Also, depending on your occupation of course, it can very often lead to more work, referrals, or promotions because it opens up the opportunity for such things and proves to people that you care about what you did for them.

My company has a very liberal 401K loan policy. I have about $25,000 in my 401K and it will be fully vested next summer, which by then should be close to $30,000 (estimate). By next summer my student loans will be down to about $20,000.



I've been toying with the idea on taking a loan out of my 401K, once fully vested, to pay off the student loans that way the interest i'm paying on the loan is to myself rather than disappearing to thin air. This would also take two payments (one private, one FSL) and take it to one. I'm only 30, so I still have plenty of time before I retire to pay it back.



It also appears that my monthly interest rate would drop from 6.9% & 8% to about 5.5% saving me money there too. A few co-workers in passing said they did the same thing and it made their lives easier.



I've always paid my loans off aggressively but this option does sound very appealing to me. Doing some rough math, it looks like my monthly payments would go from $600 a month to about $400 a month and I'll save myself close to $2,000 over the course of a 5 year loan in interest that I wouldn't get back.



So for the convenience of one lower monthly loan payment and paying interest to myself is this a good idea?

Aviation communication is heavily reliant on 2-way radio which is entirely unusable when someone is taking up the frequency, and yet I've not heard of this happening as method of sabotage. 



It's not difficult to get a 2-way radio, you need a licence to use it but that's not going to hinder someone with bad intentions and in the civil aviation world it'd be near untraceable.

So....im redoing my basement. There is, what i call a "modified pittsburgh bathroom" downthere. The pittsburgh toilet is just a toilet in the middle of basement. Ha. My basement has a full bathroom. The walls are painted cinder block. Right now the shower is 3 cinderblock walls and a somewhat sloped painted cement floor. It just has a 6in floor drain....the same as a normal basement floor drain. My question in this....can i tile right over the block and the cement floor and find a drain cover to fit. Or will i run into problems with any water that gets between the tile and the cinder block. Thanks in advance.

I can post pics when i get home if that would help

Some time in the mid Nineties, An Iranian Ambassador was having a coffee with a Diplomat from the US. The conversation had turned to the culture of the two nations, both affording compliments to one another's respective countries. Soon, the Iranian Ambassador brings up his favorite US Export; Star Trek. "You know, of all the things your country produces, there is nothing my family and I enjoy more than watching Star Trek. The stories are incredible, the characters complex and the issues fiercely relevant" The US Diplomat smiles and nods. "I'm quite the fan myself!" He exclaims. The Ambassadors expression turns a hair more serious. "However, there is one thing I do not understand. Even decades ago, Star Trek depicted a future where all races and nations were in harmony. There were Asians, whites, blacks, even a Russian! I always wondered...why are there no Arabs?!" The Diplomat gives a coy smirk. "Well, you said it yourself. It's a harmonious future"

Husband makes $60k and I make $90k.  We owe $450k on a house that's currently worth $700k.   Two small kids.  $30k in each of our retirement accounts and a combined $20k in college savings for the kids.   This is in addition to 6 months worth of emergency savings for us should one or both of us lose or jobs. 



Husbands family has a poor health history of sudden death (usually heart related).   Otherwise he's in good health.  I too am in good health with no poor medical history.



We have no idea what kind of life insurance we should purchase;  how much, term or whole, etc.  any guiding principles would be helpful. 



Thank you!

This is really hard for me to talk about but I don't want someone else to go through it like I have. In August I got a copper IUD inserted, I went back several times to have them check if the placement was correct, and they said everything was perfectly fine (and this was done by the best Ob Gyn in the entire metroplex). Two months later, now in October, I didn't have my period for about a month a half, and so I took a pregnancy test to make sure, despite being able to feel the string and my doctor assuring me there was nothing wrong with the IUD and therefore no chance of a pregnancy. As you can guess, this wasn't the case and I ended up pregnant at 19 years old (with my boyfriend of over one year). As a university student already on loans and barely being able to make ends meet, I knew there was no way I could adequately care for this child, hence the reason I had the IUD inserted in the first place. My Ob Gyn then notified me that with an IUD in place during the pregnancy, the baby would have at least a 75% chance of miscarriage. With all the factors stacking against me, I didn't have much of a choice but to get an abortion as having the baby would result in a poor life for this child and me. This was the worst decision I've ever had to make. I love children and I've always wanted to have two of my own, and the thought of having to terminate this one made me cry every day but I knew I had to. I had the IUD removed and the termination procedure done. It's been roughly a week and I'm having intense spouts of anxiety and depression as a result. I don't regret it as I know it was necessary, but it's still the hardest thing I've gone through and I think that I will ever go through. At the clinic, the doctor there said he sees people come in who have get termination procedures due to IUDs quite frequently. This is so shocking due to the fact that my Ob Gyn and all research I've found says that it's so rare to become pregnant while having an IUD. I did everything I could to protect myself against pregnancy until I was ready, I made no mistakes, I prepared against it and it still occurred because of a failed IUD and it's something that I will have to carry for the rest of my life and it hurts me every day. I just want to spread awareness of this as a possibility with IUD so less people may have to go through what I went through. I'm emotionally struggling immensely as a result and thought this community may help and give me someone to talk to. At the least, thank you for listening, and thank you for letting me get this off my chest.

I'm looking to learn more about the history of Britain, covering a period (roughly) of 500 BC to the 1800s. 



I would particularly like to learn more about how the countries in Britain were eventually formed and love the Saxon to medieval periods. 



Does any great book out there just so happen to cover these specifics?

I'm really not sure what is real anymore. 



I recently came upon a certain theology that no one really exists unless you can physically talk to them. I mean I could be wrong, I'm atheist so I strongly believe in seeing something to believe it. But then I believe in air, regardless of the fact it is invisible; so I suppose you could call me a bit of a hypocrite. I prefer the term ‘Unreliable Narrator’. Choose to view this any way you wish, but you must please bear in mind that the events that took place leading up to this are all true, no matter how hard I wish they were not. 



I suppose I should start at the beginning, even though the main event takes place years later. I've always been open to the idea of ghosts and spirits, not in the terms of the afterlife, but in the way that after people die they leave behind them an image, a semi visible afterthought if you will. This idea came to me when I started to recognise less and less people. Sure, there are the people I know by name and have spoken to physically, my friends, family, family friends, friends’ families, work colleagues, interviewers, teachers, classmates. But what about the rest? All the people in the background that you half notice but never see again, the mother with her children that you just catch across the aisle in Tesco, the people on the upper level of the shopping mall whilst you are on the bottom. Now we can almost be certain that these people exist, we notice their physical presence and are able to judge minor characteristics about them, the characteristics that make them human. But do you ever have the doubt on your mind that they aren't really there? That they are just here to fill in the gaps? Well I did. It plagued my mind that I would never see these people again, yet I had to accept the fact they were real. It seemed unfair, almost like I was missing out on something that everyone else just seemed to understand. Or maybe they were just ignorant to these occurrences and had bigger problems to deal with, like I should have. And I do have bigger problems but this one seemed more constant and imminent. If I'm dealing with these thoughts on a day to day basis, why shouldn't I try and pursue it? 

I had to wait 6 years until someone was willing to help me.



It had just turned Autumn, which is one of my favourite times of year. Not everything is quite dead yet, but you can see the trees and the greenery struggling to keep its colour before it starts to crisp over and fade away into brown. I like to think this is their fight for survival, and although their efforts were futile, it gave me hope to see something push so hard to survive, and for us to witness it in such a beautiful way. But I remember the day clearly. Me and my friend Chris would regularly go out for walks when we both had time off, have a few smokes, listen to music and just talk about whatever we had on our mind. This one particular day we were sat on the field down the back of the road where I live. I'd grown up on this field and its surrounding hills and tracks and there was a real satisfaction in smoking weed on it. I'd just lit our third joint of the afternoon and was holding it in my lungs for longer than usual. If you smoke, you'll understand the affect of this. Chris was halfway through his theory on The Walking Dead,



“-but then if he kills Maggie then he's basically killing her unborn child too and with such a rich storyline to pursue, it'd just be stupid for the writers do that!”



I take another toke and think carefully to myself before passing it to him. 



“You know, if I was the show runners,” I begin, “I would put all the names of those in the line up in a hat and just pick one. You see, the beauty of when Negan kills Glenn in the comics is the utter randomness of it. You don't see it coming. Any decision the writers make is going to be predictable because they've made that decision with the next season in mind, so they have to tailor who they kill. If it's random it could be someone like Rick and that would be fucking mad.”



Chris is staring at me like I don't know what I'm on about. He laughs, coughing smoke up everywhere before handing me the joint. 



“You've packed this one more than the others haven't you?”, he asks, his eyes beginning to water a little. 



“Maybe,”, I retort, “what's the point in smoking if we aren't going to get-,”



I pause because I see something in the distance. About half a mile from where we are sat there is a hill adjacent to a cliff edge and at the very peak of the hill there is a bunker. It's been there as long as any of us can remember and we still aren't sure what it's use was. It's one barred door is locked and you can't see anything through the tiny windows. Judging by the bars on it, we assumed it was some temporary holding cell that the council has now locked to stop kids going in and fucking or doing drugs. But what I could see was a man stood on top of the bunker, this is normally a regular thing to see because it's a pretty fucking cool place to hang out, but this guy was alone on the hill and was just stood there, appearing to look at us. 



“What the hell is that guy doing on the bunker?”, I asked Chris who had just finished another coughing fit.



“I don't know mate,”, he croaked.



I don't know whether it was the fact I was stoned or just my natural curiosity, but this felt like the answer to the question I'd been asking myself all my life. But I needed to pursue this. 



“Lets go have a look, he might be selling drugs,”, I always know how to convince Chris to do anything. 



“Do we have to?”, he whined back, “We already have drugs,”



“But this way we could get more,”



“Preach,” he shouted, jumping to his feet. 



I flicked the roach away and leapt up after him. I wanted to get up there quickly, too many times I had tried this on my own and been too slow to catch anyone. I suppose this partly proves my point that they were never there but this time I needed a witness to make sure I wasn't lying.

We were hurtling up the steep path towards the hill, Chris was panting like some unearthly beast but I was spurred on by my curiosity for the unknown. We reached the crest of the hill together and stopped briefly to catch our breath. It was Chris that noticed the bunker first. 



“Where's that guy gone?”, he asked. 



He was right to ask where he had gone because the man had in fact gone. Noticing this, I sprinted up to the peak of the hill, artfully dodging the many badger and rabbit holes decorating the surface. I turned my head back to see Chris slowly trudging up the slope. I reached the bunker and immediately circled it to look for any evidence to suggest the guy has actually been there. There was none. I clambered on top of the bunker to get a better view of my surroundings. In comparison to the rest of the town I grew up in, this was the lowest highest point of the town. So I could pretty much see all the lower part of the town. But the hilltop was dead. So dead in fact that the silence was almost deafening. There was no sound of the wind, even the regular noise of the sea crashing against the cliff edge seemed to have disappeared. At the time I took no notice of it because I was stoned, I took it to just be the adrenaline silencing any background noise. After rotating in a circle about 5 times it came to my attention that I couldn't see Chris anywhere, all i could see was a couple of kids on the field we ran up from. I called his name and circled again, this time more rapidly. Cursing, I hopped down off the bunker and started to head back down the hill to find Chris, defeated. But then I noticed something else strange. The barred door that was normally padlocked shut was open. Not ajar, but there was no evidence of a padlock, almost like it had never been there. My first thought was that Chris has become enticed by the mystery of an unlocked door that was normally locked, so I followed suit. 



I gently eased the door open, expecting an abnormally loud creaking sound but there was nothing. Like it had been oiled 5 minutes ago, or that it was a new door. The entrance to the bunker was riddled with crushed cans and cigarette butts, where kids had just thrown them. I precariously stepped through the mess which extended for a couple of feet, before the bunker opened up to the main interior. There was no sign of Chris. There was no sign of life either, you'd expect there to maybe a couple of rats or even a fox. But I found nothing like that. The light was fairly poor inside the bunker so I took out my phone to have a better look at my surroundings. What I saw is something I shall not soon forget. 



Now I don't have a large variety of clothes, I'm a fairly simple man but when I saw the exact clothes I was wearing at that moment, sprawled out in front of me, my breath caught in my throat and I fell back against the wall behind me.



“What the fuck,” I exclaimed to no one in particular. Surveying the situation, I didn't know what the hell to think. Had someone been stalking me and left all my personal items here as a message? One hell of an obscure message, what the shit was going on? I noticed that I was breathing quite rapidly now so I started to regain control of my breath, slowing it down gently. I'd been slouched against the wall in the bunker for about 5 minutes now, taking in my surroundings and trying to get a better idea of what this meant. I make a decision and decide to move towards my belongings. To this day I don't understand who put them there but I think I now know why. I'm about to pick up my crumpled shirt what I hear a clanging slam reverberate through the bunker. The door! 

I wave my hands wildly around the surrounding area and throw myself round the corner, where I can plainly see that the barred door has now been padlocked shut. I grip the bars and release a wordless scream. No one replies. I lower my head and rest it against the bars of the door, tears beginning to build behind my eyes. 



“Chris,” I mutter weakly. I gently raise my head and see Chris. He's sat where we were before, as if nothing had happened. He's with someone as well but I can't make out who it is. Suddenly, Chris leaps to his feet and starts to run at full speed, the person he's with doing the same. But it's not me. And then it clicks. 



I'm not sure what is more daunting, the realisation that I've been here longer than I thought or that I'm just stuck in the background like the rest of them.

Specifically Convergence. I would love to decorate my living room with this framed poster, but I can't manage to find a copy that's longer than 104 cm. I would like it to be atleast 140 cm in length. Does anybody know?

In reviewing my family's documents I remembered that 25 years ago we had an attorney prepare a family trust document. However, none of our assets have ever been transferred into the trust. There is no pour-over will providing that assets will be transferred into the trust upon death. My family owns less than $1 million in assets, I have a spouse and two kids and figure everything will go to my spouse or my kids 50/50, and our family and asset situation is not complicated. 



At this point, should I just leave everything as is and not bother transferring anything into the trust? I understand this means that upon my death the trust will fail and essentially be null and void.

I'm a year out of college and am almost at the point where I have my safety net saved up in a savings account. Once I have that saved up, I'm deciding between maxing out my 401k and saving for a down payment on a home, likely both. 



I want to save enough to avoid PMI, and I don't know whether I want a home in 1 year or 5 years, so I don't want to simply throw it all in a savings account. What's the best type of account to use for this situation? I need it liquid enough to be able to take it out with a few months advance, but want to earn money on it in case it sits there for 5 years. 



I'm earning $120k/yr pre tax. Hopefully I'll have the down payment saved up in the next year if that matters.

An inheritance came that I want to invest what's left after taxes. Paid off all debt, but didn't buy any major 'stuff' (car, house, etc), just want to invest it. Thing is, the outcome of the election has me pretty spooked (how certain outcomes could affect the markets). I already have old investments, and those are not being meddled with much, they've been going a long time and I just sit out the bad and enjoy the good, overall they've done ok and I'm sticking those out come what may.



It freaks me out to have a big liquid savings account just sitting there doing essentially *nothing*, but I am really struggling to focus on investing it lately. Is this a merit-able reason to hold off for a few months, or am I just being paranoid?

Basically,this book has a shady organization with crazy powers, a bunch of alien beings and a bit of amnesia thrown in for fun,whats not to like? Quentin Drake wakes up in a strange hospital with no memory of who he is and why he has a bunch of injuries(kinda like Jason Bourne).However,where this book differs from the Bourne series is that here we have a bunch of people called The Community,who have access to artifacts that endow the user with strange powers(like mind control or turning metal into rubber).Quentin has to try and get his memory back, and try to figure out why his friend died with sand stuffed inside his guts.All while the Community and a bunch of mysterious killer beings are trying to stop him.

I understand, in space, "Relative" is everything. So relatively speaking of course



Bonus Question: Given the rate of expansion of space, how much farther must these two galaxies travel to reach each other, over the course of the trip, than the "current measured distance apart".....again I understand that what we "See" now is not the current "real" distance from Andromeda due to the speed of light.

Well like most tifus this didn't happen today, but when I was about 12.



At that age I was in a theater troupe made up entirely of girls that age. We did plays out of the leader/director's backyard (and other venues at times, but this story happens in the backyard).



So we were all at the director's, (let's call her Jane, why the fuck not) house for a rehearsal one day. During a break me and another girl got into a sort of play fight, fake karate and prop swords kind of thing, and during the course of this, I took my shoes off. They were cheap-ish sandals with very little friction and the grass was wet, I didn't want to fall. Jane calls our break over and we go back to rehearsing, and I never put my shoes back on.



About an hour later, rehearsal is over and everyone is clearing out. I was waiting for my father to come pick me up, as the only one not allowed to go home on their own, so I was the last one there. I started grabbing my stuff, knowing he'll be there soon, and realized something horrifying: I can't find my fucking shoes.



Thinking of telling my father that I lost my shoes, and of the fight that would break out between my recently separated parents at my shoes going missing while I was in his care, I started going into hysterics. Jane, noticing me bawling my eyes out and trying to find something apparently under the grass in her yard (that was not long enough for anything to hide in) asked what was wrong. I told her through tears "I can't find my shoes!"



We start looking through her yard, I know exactly where I took them off but it wouldn't be below one of the girls to move them somewhere just to fuck with me. They're not there, at all. So we go into her house, and find a pair of blue sandals that don't belong to anyone in her family. At that point she suggests that maybe someone took my shoes by accident, but I wasn't having any of it. No, my sandals were brown and they had a cheetah print strap, no one took them by accident instead of these bright blue flip flops goddammit. No, someone had clearly stolen my shoes. And since we didn't know whose flip flops had been left in her house, it could have been any of the 12 other girls.



I hear my father's truck pull up outside and start bawling all over again, having no other choice than to go outside and face him. On my way out, instead of going through the front door, I go back out through the yard to use the side gate. I suppose I was subconsciously trying to pronlong the time before I had to make the ridiculous confession that I had lost my shoes of all things.



One step out of the gate, sniffling and with my head down, I see my shoes. Right there, outside the gate, where we didn't bother to look because I took my shoes off IN the backyard.



Of course, I them had to confess to Jane that after making her help me tear her yard and house apart for half an hour that I found my shoes in about 5 seconds. Then I wiped my face as best I could so my father wouldn't ask why I had been crying, and went to get in the car.



Tl;dr: I lost my shoes, looked for them for half an hour while crying my eyes out, then found them by accident in the one place I neglected to check.

The ceiling of my bathroom was full of black dots. I'm pretty sure this was caused by water vapor from the shower and it was worse close to the window, where it is colder and condensation occurs more easily. Next to the light, where it is warmer, there was no mold at all.



I got advice from my neighbors and saw several web pages about it. Spraying bleach won't won't work on porous materias if the mold is deep inside, but in this case everything was on the surface so it was ok. Took all precautions, covered my eyes, mouth and hands, and used a white bathrobe to protect my clothes. Ventilation was good and I didn't spray more than 1m^2 per day to avoid the buildup of toxic gases.



Results are good, my ceiling is whiter than ever, but...



Now water condenses much more easily than before. I let it dry very well for several days using a dehumidifier, but still every time I take a shower it all becomes wet. I can recognize the spraying pattern in the moisture even if it was caused by vapor, which makes me think that spraying it made it prone to condensation. I'm concerned not only that the mold will come back very easily with this extra water, but also that the paint may be ruined.



Not posting pictures because it's not easily visible if not looking at it in person.



I know there will always be *some* condensation with a lot of vapor on a cold surface, but hopefully I can get it closer to the pre-treatment levels? Google only tells me what I already know about bleach (hazardous gases, porous materias, etc).



Is there anything I can do about it?

I am 19, have a 630 credit score (I have had a car payment since june, never missed one), I've had a steady good paying job for a year and 3 months, I make in the neighborhood of $900-$975 every two weeks, and if I need to, I can put my car down for collateral. I'm looking to get $4,500. Would it be easier/more possible if I were to go through a credit union?

So a boy walks into a brothel dragging a dead frog on a string behind him. He walks up to the madame and places $100 dollars on the counter and says he would like to fuck on of the madame's whores. The boy asks if any of the madame's whores have any diseases and the madame quickly tells him no. The boy says he wants to have sex specifically with someone who has an STD. The madame, confused, take the little boy to a room and has one of her whores take care of him. The little boy has sex with the whore several times to ensure he has contracted whatever she has. 

On the way out the madame asks the little boy, "why did you want to have sex with someone with a disease?"  The boy responds, "later tonight I am going to have sex with my babysitter and she will contract the disease. After that my babysitter will have sex with my dad, my dad will have sex with my mom and my mom will have sex with the mailman who will eventually contract the disease. And he's the fucker who killed my frog!"

Hi all, 



Every cycle, right after ovulation, I develop extreme anxiety and panic attacks. I get fearful that I am about to have a seizure or stroke, and it's incredibly debilitating. I also have an issue with any sort of coffee consumption. Does this sound familiar? Has anyone had relief with this?

Hello everyone.



I'm looking to start my own business. Nothing big. No employees. Just me, myself, and I. Just doing my work under a business name so I can be taxed correctly, and I can make write-offs.



I'm 25 and quite clueless about this stuff, and no one around me knows much about this. I'm also in NJ, USA, if that means anything different.



Please and thank you for all advice you can help me with!!

I am 20 something  male who just landed first real job starting at 50k a year. I'm reading up or 401ks and IRA and such as I have neither. Now I understand to Max at 401k. I was also reading on here and many pay mention the 2008 financial crash... what people mean when they say half of retirement saving s were lost.  If it happened before why do people suggest to invest so heavily into 401k when they can just go bottom up in the future?

My finances 22 weeks pregnant, working in a busy cafe and getting very tired during the day/week. I thought I'd ask ideas from women who've been there before. What are some things you enjoyed doing while pregnant? What relaxed you? What are some things you wished people had done?etc Also she's got a really bad cough at the moment any good remedies? Any helps appreciated thanks.

I've started playing Dishonored and got to the part where the boat guy has to take us to our first assassination mission.



Does it really get better from there on? Ever since I've started the game I was very underwhelmed by the lack of contrast and colors in the game and the "cinematic black bars" hurt my immersion. 



The assassination of the queen or empress or whatever felt really underwhelming to me as there was no character development leading me to not give a shit about the empress.



Her kid being kidnapped didn't give me any motivation either and I felt that I'd rather just join the bad guys than go after some weakly developed character.



Should I give the game a chance by giving it a full playthrough or should I just move onto another game since I haven't started to *like* this one yet.

tl;dr: I recently moved and am trying to sell my old property. The first buyer tried to get an FHA loan, but the inspector said there was less than two years of life left on the roof and won't approve it unless I pay to put a new roof on.  I have a second party interested in a "Rent to Own" deal and they will take care of the roof themselves.  Which option causes the least potential issues?



Detailed Verson:



I am going to try and keep things relevant, but there's a lot of factors that I am trying to balance out here.  It started when my wife's father died and her mother moved in with us.  Our little 1000 square foot house was no longer big enough for my wife. We went looking for a new property, and found one that we all loved that would fit the new size of our household.



I had the original house in my name alone, because I purchased it when I was single.  I have a 15 year mortgage with a low interest rate, and the payments are less than $700 a month.  I have no other debt.  Student loans are paid off.  My 14 year old car is paid in full.  My wife's car is paid in full.  We use two credit cards (one for me and one for my wife) for expenses and pay them off completely every month.  My credit score is great.  With my wife's income and my own (take-home about $4,500), we're fine.  My wife has always spent too much, a relationships issue really, and we had to replace the A/C at the old house so we have no savings to speak of. Yeah, I am ashamed of that.  There was a time when I did have six months of expenses saved up.



Anyway, her mom "gifted" us $10,000 towards the down payment.  Officially, this is a gift.  But, it's really a 0% interest loan that we need to pay back.  I went, with my wife, to get financing for the new house and we were initially denied.  Credit score too low.  Credit card balances too high!  Uhm, what?!



Turns out, my wife had credit cards in her own name that I was aware existed but didn't know she had maxed out.  They were supposed to be for rebuilding her credit score and paid off each month.  She'd been hiding it from me and paying them with money from extra she was making on her paychecks.  In total, it's ~$10,000 at a weighted average of 25% APR.  I don't know the full details of this until after sitting down with her later and getting it all out in the open.  But, I push through with trying to get a mortgage.



Fortunately, depending on how you look at things, my income, credit, and lack of debts is enough to get me approved for an FHA mortgage on my own without her income.  I hate the extra I have to pay with this mortgage type, but whatever.  We get the approval and buy the house we loved, knowing it needed about $6,000 in landscaping work to make it functional for our dogs.  Hurricane Matthew tears through just recently, and adds a bunch of tree removal costs to that figure and brings it up to $7,000 total.  The storm does not do enough damage to approach our deductible, so it's all out of pocket costs.



We find a buyer for the other house, at the bottom of what I want to take for it, and everything is fine until the FHA inspection denies the house because of the age of the roof.  Now, we could pay $9,000 for a new roof and lose that much more on the sale of the house, or we can back out.  The other big issue is that we can't even get roofers to schedule their work.  Everyone is booked three plus months into the future because of roof damage from the hurricane.  So, even if we wanted to pay that money, we can't get a roofer.



In steps our landscaper who can only get approved for $100,000 for a house.  He wants to do a rent to own agreement for the house, paying us $1,100 in rent each month and giving us a lump sum of extra from his business profits at the end of the year to bring the total amount of the house down.  He's willing to "pay" the current asking price.  If the roof does actually fail or develop problems while he lives there, he trades labor with a friend of his that does roofs and he will just put a new roof on at his own expense and for much cheaper than I could afford to.



It seems like the best solution.  It takes the $700 mortgage and the ~$150 monthly utilities off my current budget.  But, it means we don't get to just pay off all the wife's cards.  We can take the extra and put it towards the cards.  It also means my mother-in-law has to wait for her money (which she says is fine).



Concerns:



* How do I handle the lump sum of extra money he wants to use to bring down the price left on the house?  Putting it on the mortgage itself would be bad if the deal falls through and I need to pay him back.  I am afraid it would be counted as taxable income for me.

* He doesn't like credit or banks.  He will pay in checks or cash and wants to just keep receipts as proof.  This is more risky for him, I think, but I am concerned about it looking like I am dealing with undocumented income.

* My insurance and property taxes will go up, but they should still be less than his monthly payment.  It might not be enough less to contribute towards the purchase of the house, how do I protect myself in that case?

* Could I be getting scammed or screwed here?  I am going to find and speak to a real-estate attorney and have them draw up the contract that represents my desires and protects my interest, but I am not even sure I know all the questions to ask.

* This will cost me more in credit card interest and personal stress (mother-in-law debt), but may save me more than enough money in commission fees on the sale that makes up for those.

* I am currently in contract with a realtor to sell the house.  They are willing to release me from that for the expenses that have incurred and they say I might owe the title agency some money for the work they have done.  My contract says that they can come after me for the commission if I sell the house before the end of the original contract date (Feb. of 2017).  Would this rent to own contract be considered a sale they could demand commission on, since it was entered during that window?



I think that's it.  I am speaking with a real estate attorney this week, trying to find one first, and going to pay them to make sure I don't mess up.  Is there anything I am over-looking?  Would it just be better to find the money and put a new roof on the house and relist it a little higher to try and recoup some (not all) of the cost?

Reflected light...



The moon, street lamps, dock lights, fone lights...



Why do I see a single and distinct reflection of the moon on the water...rather than a dispersed reflection of the moon or multiple reflections of the moon.



Reflected light is always pointing towards me with its greatest intensity. 

 

Why? How?

I'm on my phone so I'll try to make it short. My parents, dad being in his early 50s and mom in late 40s are worried that they have not really have a financial plan, as of now they live a lifestyle they can afford but if something was to happen theres no savings, no nothing. So since they paid off some debts and freed up money, instead of just putting it into a savings account, they came across Primerica and they are being sold their services, mutual funds, managed accounts, etc. Because a friend of them actually had apparent success with them and actually have received returns in their investment.





So I ask, are they about to get scammed or they are actually, besides the pyramid scheme of things, a viable way to have some sort of planning for the future? I also ask for myself because being 25, I don't have a plan, besides finishing school and finding a good job afterwards. 



I hope this is the right place and thanks in advance for any replies!

Suddenly, the professor popped a question,‘What is ((353.44634×153×15)+799²-285)×69-0.2 equal to?’



The students were really confused, one who was extremely frustrated stands up and yells and slams on his table,‘NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN!’ The teacher was impressed and said,‘ Correct, now you can sit down, Adolf.’

I (30) recently started a new job at a NFP and was reading this NYT [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news).



Disclaimer: I only have a slight idea of what I'm talking about.



My current investment portfolio is:



- 403(b) through MassMutual 50/50 split between [VSMAX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=vsmax&ei=Rk0LWJmPIoS6mAGFwLWIAg) and [RDHTX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=rdhtx&ei=Mk0LWIHBFMaGmAHpyJrgDQ)



- [VASIX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF%3AVASIX&ei=Fk0LWPH1EoGmmAGr-r_wAQ) which I contribute to personally as my finances allow



- My Roth IRA [VFIFX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF%3AVFIFX&ei=zkwLWNmkBs-ymAG88bu4CA) 



- A small chunk of change in [DSNY](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:DIS) for giggles (Star Wars made me do it)



My question is primarily whether the 0.78% ER on my RDHTX 403(b) needs to be addressed.

Additionally, are there any glaring mistakes in my portfolio?

* According to the profiles of each, they have fairly similar asset allocations...Schwab has about 5% more into domestic vs int'l with total stocks making up 90% of the portfolio. Both have pretty similar allocations in which industries they are invested in as well.



* These do differ a bit more in regards to their bond allocations though.



**Am i overthinking this? I should pretty much stick to Schwab with the lower rate?**

I ask this question because I only have Netflix, and some other streaming services seem to have more recent, popular movies. I'm considering getting an Amazon Prime subscription, because Prime has movies like Ex Machina, Sicario, and The Witch, as well as major franchises like Lethal Weapon and The Matrix. Soon, most of the Rocky movies and most of the James Bond movies are going to be added as well. While Netflix definitely has the best original content, that doesn't really cover movies enough, in my opinion. 



Netflix currently has recent movies like Spotlight and The Big Short, as well as a small selection of IMDB Top 250 movies like Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, and The Usual Suspects. The Disney deal means that Marvel and Star Wars movies will be streaming on Netflix, Zootopia is already available, and The Jungle Book is coming in late November. The top four movies of this year (Captain America: Civil War, Zootopia, Finding Dory, and The Jungle Book) are, or will be, on Netflix, and by the end of the year, with Doctor Strange, Moana, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Disney could have the top seven of 2016. It's hard to argue against Netflix, since it has the rights to some of the most critically and commercially successful movies of the year. Still, franchises like Back to the Future and Lethal Weapon have left Netflix recently, and it seems like more movies are leaving by the month. 



Since Netflix is usually seen as the dominant streaming service, it's hard to argue against it. Yet, Hulu has recent episodes of TV added quickly, Amazon Prime has movies that are less than a year old constantly being added, and HBO Now has an excellent selection of great, recent movies. 



I'd love to know what you all think, what's your favorite streaming service for movies?

"Shoplifting" he says, "how about you?"

When Caleb's first watching the video of the sessions with the old AI's... the bit just before the robot is banging its hands against the door until the shatter off - why does he say "Jesus Christ!"



He's only seen a pair of legs being built up, and then Nathan trying to get the robot to write, then picking it up off the floor in the next room for some reason. Did they cut something?



I *think* it was him witnessing abuse - but nothing in the scene looked like abuse.

Whenever i hear about electric car charging stations, someone always suggests they wont be efficient unless they can charge much faster. I would like to know how they plan to improve the charging rates.



I would guess it depends on the leads of the battery in the car. For example if i buy a new electric car now. Does it have a max charge rate? Say 5 or ten years later much newer cars have faster charge rates for the batteries, and faster output for the charging stations. 



When a certain charge rate does become standard, for batteries and car chargers, will the slower batteries be left behind? Or can the batteries just accept whatever input speed they get from the charging station.



I guess the answer im looking for here is really: Which will determine how fast your electric car will be able to charge, the battery or the charging stations.



Thanks!

I have been searching reddit for answers. And I am hoping that someone somewhere has experienced what I have for the last 2 years. So far, I have not had any luck with finding answers, so I am going to post something about it. 



It all started when I was chopping vegetables and cut my finger. I headed to the emergency room and while I was avoiding the creepy guy in the waiting room, I saw an ad needing volunteers for a medical study. 



I took the flier and called about it. They were offering 5000.00 for a 6 week study to help severe stroke patients brains work better. I would not have to take any medication and I only would have to spend 4 days in the hospital. Two days at the start and 2 days at the end.



Considering this was right before Christmas, I jumped at the chance. And believe it or not, there were no restrictions. The only qualifying factor was that you were between the ages of 18-50 and have had no seizures or strokes in the past. The following is a very brief run down of how the study played out for me.



I showed up, signed papers and was given a room in a hospital. I shared the room with a women, named nancy, around my age. She was a stroke victim, and just layed in her bed looking up at the ceiling. She did not move...well I guess she could blink and sometimes as night she farted. But over all she was an easy roommate. 



 



After I met her they had me put on the  dreaded gown and wheeled me into the surgery room. I knew this was the part that was going to be weird. 



In this study, they would be putting a smalll chip, in the back of my head. I would have a small spot of my head shaved, put into a twilight and have this "chip" inserted into my head...not in my brain..they said...just my head.



When I woke up later that night, my throat hurt. I remember when I was a kid and having my appendix taken out, I was intubated and after the surgery, my throat hurt, just like now. I also noticed that many hours had passed since I was wheeled into the Operating room. 



I guess looking back, these were my first red flags. I kinda felt like, something wasn;t right. At the time, I asked if I had some complications. I was told everything went great. That did not reassure me though it just made my apprehension grow. Were they lying?



This apprehension eased a bit, when I noticed nancy had the same thing on her head. And then I felt even better when I saw her improving. She could stay in a seated postition and I swear she made a sound.



I was told that everything I did, she would do as well. If I sat up, they came and sat her up. If I watched a movie, she watched the same movie. If I went potty, they came and catherized her. I was told this was to measure my brain waves doing these things and her brain waves as well. They hoped to be able to understand the differences, they said, in hopes of learning how to reboot stroke victims brains.



I was realeased the next morning, and I asked them why there were no wires coming from the chip. I just wasn't sure how they could measure my brain waves without the chip being hooked up to some sort of EEg machine. They just reassured me, it was all good and that I should come back next week to download my brain waves into the system.



I don't know why I bought this, but I did. I feel so stupid now. But the next 3 weeks I went back for every visit. They said I was doing great and I was helping out humanity. So I never questioned anything, well until the 4th week.



I will never forget that day, not ever. I walked in and sat in a chair, shortly after that, my roommate, Nancy, walked in. I mean she walked in. I was floored. My mouth dropped and I stared at her.



I noticed she starred at me and I watched as her mouth dropped. I did smile then. I mean she was better, I know I didn;t know her but WOW she seemed to make a huge recovery.



I watched as she slowly walked towards me and she watched me, even as she sat down in the chair next to me. I held out my hand to shake her hand, and she gave me her hand. I stared into her eyes and I felt a small tear fall from my eye. I knew she felt the same way because a tear fell from her eye as well.



I just blurted out..." Hi" and she blurted out Hi right back to me. I said, "How are you doing?" and she said "how are you doing?" I laughed and she laughed. 



I guess, I should have seen it earlier, but I didn't. I didn't until I reached up to push my hair out of my eyes and watched as she reached up to push her hair out of her eyes. Right about the time, it dawned on me, that she had no hair to push aside, nurses, doctors and well...everyone in the whole place came barrelling down on us.



She was literally carried away from me and I was shuffled into a back room. Everything after that was a blur, everyone looked like a blur. Noone seemed to look normal to me anymore. I mean I noticed that noone talking to me, blinked. I mean I don't think they blinked, anyway. I didn't notice any kind of facial changes in any nurse, doctor or orderly that talked to me. 



In the end, I was told there was a mix up. That nancy, should not have been scheduled for her follow up on the same day as me. There was a mistake and that unfortunatly, I was going to be taken off the study. They wrote me a check right there but told me I would have to come back on the last 2 days of the study to remove the chip. 



They told me it would be okay. They told me, I had helped nancy and she woudl continue to improve and to make sure I came back to get the chip out. I signed some papers and was pushed out the door. 



None of my questions were answered. And I think this is were things get super scary for me. I was followed home that day by a nice man. A man that recently died a very horrible death. He had a chip implanted as well, and I worry about whether or not his death was an accident. 



He told me things, things I am afraid to repeat..but because of my chronic headaches and the odd numbers, that seem to come out of my mouth for no reason...I am here. I need to take a break here and think about how much I want to share on reddit. I will be back, but in the meantime, don't sign up for any medical research studies!

Hello everybody. Thanks to student loans I have poor credit. While my credit score has improved the last couple years, it's nowhere near where I want it. So I'm taking steps to improve it. I have 0 credit card debt and no credit cards. Therefore I can only get one myself through a secured card. Or I could be added as an authorized user to my fiances (Who has excellent credit because I've used her credit the whole time she was in college.) I'm just curious which one would improve my credit at the fastest rate. Any input will be greatly appreciated!

What, in your opinion, would be the most intimidating World War tank? IMO, it would be the Mark V Male tank from late WWI (and small service in the German defence of Berlin in WWII in 1945). With two heavy cannons and machine guns, it's something I would not want to fight. 

Sidenote I'm just thinking as a general look at the tank. I'm not too worried about design flaws or performance limitations, I'm just looking at the broad view of the tank.

An Amish Mother and Daughter are riding in the buggy home from the market one crisp Autumn day when the Daughter says her hands are cold as she has forgotten her mittens, the Mother being wise tells her to place them between her thighs and it will warm them up.The next day a male suitor comes calling and the Daughter asks her Mothers permission to go on a Buggy Ride and into town with him, they head out to spend the day together, but soon after only a mile or two he complains of his hands being cold as he had forgotten his gloves she says," place them between my thighs and I'll warm them up". A few days later the Mother and Daughter are washing dishes when the Daughter asked her Mother if she knows what a penis is, the Mother looks at her shocked and replies YES!, The Daughter then says" Man those fuckers are messy when they thaw out."

I keep having issues with paying my student loans through Nelnet. This is the 4th time I have paid my monthly bill only to have my payments not be allocated properly. For some reason they keep taking both payments for to different loans and putting them both on the U.S. department of education loan. That means they cannot refund to wrong payment to put towards the correct account because they do not have access to us department of education. I am starting to get very frustrated and am getting no help from Nelnet. I cannot be the only person this is happening to.

Forgive me, I really am clueless when it comes to investments. I'm trying to learn online but this stuff is confusing as heck. I recently got married and I'm trying to organize our finances and whatnot. We each kept our own checking accounts and moved our savings into a high yield savings account. Things are looking good.

Years ago I worked at a place that had a 401k plan and I got it up to about 10k. Then I moved on and started my career at a place where 401k isn't offered yet. So I asked around and heard that I should take that account and turn it into a rollover IRA account. I still don't understand what it is, but I did it. It's been sitting for a few years without any contributions (I know that's bad, im sorry) and it hasn't moved much. It hovers around 10k and sometimes dips to as low as 8k. So I'm just curious about the advantages of investing in this account versus, say, putting money into our high yield savings account where I'm guaranteed slow but steady growth. Is it mostly tax purposes? Apologies and thanks for any information.

My wife and me are looking to build a college fund for our newborn nephew.  We've talked to a bank, and they seem to think a "trust fund" set up under an EIN would be the best option, as a 529 would not work appropriately with the funding he might receive from FAFSA.



Background info to help with some decisions:

I'm 32, my wife is 29, our yearly income is about 165k not counting bonuses.  Lots of job security, promotions not impossible.  We're 7 years into owning our first home which will be paid off late 2024.  We have no children, just animals, and are not going to be having children.  

My sister & her partner are mid-twenties, working in restaurants full time and able to rent a nice apartment.  Their yearly income is ~75k joint with tips.  They intend to have at least one more kid in the coming years, and both are hoping to go back to school over the course of the next few years.



In a dream world, they would both get promotions or their dream career out of college.  I'm worried that making a 529 would ruin his chance of FAFSA, which from what I am told would cover a pretty large chunk of his loans.  



Our bank suggested talking to an attorney and making a EIN/Trust fund set up for him, so that it will not affect his FAFSA loans.  A 401k was also mentioned however it didn't sound like an option that was "best" for everyone.  



I'm looking for opinions on what the "best" course of action would be here?  I am looking to put 5-8k away per year for him.  And if he chooses a trade school or something else, the money could be used elsewhere.  I would also like constraints, because I am okay with my sister having the ability to put money in, and see what is in there, but would like a "safety" to avoid any possible issues.



Sorry for the mess here, it's a lot more confusing to do this then I thought it would be, and googling for this information was not any help.

There are so much things that could influence your opinion on a movie. 



For example:

When you are watching it, where you are watching it, with who you are watching it, is there a silence in a theater, hate train, hype train, theme of a movie, pacing of a movie, actor/director that you like, actor/director that you hate, nostalgia, faded memory of a film watched as a kid or something...



And I could go on and on...



There is a high chance, that, in some other circumstances, you would end up liking a movie that you didn't like, or other way around.



Very rare people are judging a movie based on it's quality.



Now, I am not saying, that movie can lack entertaining value or something, but judging a movie solely on whether you like it or not, or because you jumped on a hype train is wrong, because it is a subjective thing.

I read up and so far I understand that NVG's are image enhancers, and they collect IR and natural light. Curious as to how that technology works, and how is that different than thermal, which (I believe) operates with the infrared. Finally how does thermal use IR to detect differences in heat... guessing wave length?

Over the past few years, I have had had an incessant itch on the lower portion on my sack. Without thinking about it, I would just scratch it. Sometimes it would hurt because the skin down there  is thin and I probably caused small tears with my scratching. 



I have been single for over 2 years and I just stated dating an amazing woman. To be sure I am ready for our "special dates," I took out a mirror to make sure that everything was kosher with the equipment. To my dismay, the lower portion of my sack now looks very blotchy. 



I hope my new girlfriend is not too overly freaky so that we can have tame sex for the first few times so that she doesn't have to look down there and discover my disturbing surprise. 



TL/DR: I have blotchy ball sack due to aggressively scratching over a period of a few years. 



LPT: Never "scratch your nuts," pinch and roll instead.

Just like title says. What scripts or abandoned movies would you like to see turned into an animated movie or graphic novel. Personally I wouldn't mind seeing some of the Batman or Superman scripts turned into something. There are just way to many cool or odd scripts out there of Batman or Superman. So put what you wouldn't mind seeing.

This happened yesterday. I was hungry, so what better to eat than some chicken tenders breaded in Cheez Its? So took out a pan, put some oils in the pan, and dropped in the chicken tenders. I decided to add some stuff into the mix. I took some pepper and sprinkled it in. I also crushed up some pork rinds and added them. Then I had the grand chef idea to add a little chicken broth in. I don't eve know why. I told myself not to do it, as well. I knew oil and water don't mix. I still did it, though. Right when the broth hit the sizzling oil, a huge fire erupted from the pan. I freaked out and turned off the burner. The fire stopped, and I continued to finish up my tenders. They tasted amazing. This isn't the first time i failed really hard at cooking something that should've been easy to cook.





tl;dr: I made some pretty good chicken tenders by setting them aflame, almost burning down a house a second time.

This may not be the correct place to post, someone please redirect me otherwise. 



I ordered a Bedset online for 4K which included the Bedset ( headboard, footboard, posts etc ), two dressers, a larger dresser and mirror for the larger dresser. Ordered from appliance connection, an online company. 



We got the delivery about 3 weeks ago but I didn't bother to put it together because we didn't have out mattress yet. Insert today, and I find out the headboard is missing. I know HUGE mistake on my part. When they delivered, I signed for the delivery of 7 boxes. Which is true, I received 7 boxes ( at the time I inspected some things to make sure everything was in good condition and it was ). Upon trying to figure out a way to save my ass, I see the delivery was set for 7 pieces : head board, footboard, rails, 2x night stand , mirror and large dresser. The "7" pieces I actually got were all of those minus the headboard. The posts for the headboard were in a separate box which is probably why at the time I signed off to the delivery of 7 pieces. What can I do???? I know it's a huge no, no but we opened a credit card with this company to finance the set. If they do not work with me to send the headboard how can I go about disputing the charge and cancelling it??? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I had an idea for fallout 5, the idea is that you play the first half of the game in pre apocalyptica and the second half in apocalyptica, get to experience the great war, possibly as a soldier, battle radiation and in the end decided on which path you take end up as a super mutant, a ghoul, or as some sort of authority figure for a civilization.



This story would take place in California, and include many of the attractions of Cali. 



Maybe a prequel to the NCR or the BoS?

Do you guys have any ideas for a short film that you were never able to create, or would just flat out love to see be made? Well i'm asking for them! Nothing too crazy (Ex: Justice League vs Avengers, or an Alien Invasion) but something practical. You can go as in-depth as you wish in your idea, or just drop a one sentence idea! Help me out! I'm not asking for your money, or any sort of funding, just your ideas! Comment or PM me!

This young lady walks into a pet store to buy a parrot. The guy behind the counter says that he only has one and that it’s a real “smart-ass” with a vulgar vocabulary and rude temperament.



The woman says, “That’s okay, I know how to handle smartasses like that. I want the parrot anyhow.”

So the woman gets the bird home, puts it in her room, and starts to get ready for bed. Just as she gets her slacks off the parrot says: “Awk . . . nice legs, baby!”



Well, the woman isn’t gonna take such abuse, so she takes the bird out of the cage and puts it in the freezer for three minutes. While the parrot’s in the freezer, he becomes real sure that this was the wrong thing to say, and is making a large mental note about saying that again.



The next night, again the woman is getting ready for bed. This time the parrot knows not to say anything about her legs, but after she removes her blouse, and then her bra, the parrot just can’t resist any longer. He blurts out, “Awk . . . great tits, baby, let’s see ya shake um.”



Once again the woman gets upset and she decides that instead of three minutes in the freezer, she is going to keep the parrot in for five minutes. This time the parrot has lots of time to think. Remorse gives way to desperation, and finally to anger.



Finally, the woman opens the freezer door, takes out the near frozen parrot and says, “Well, have you learned your lesson?”

The parrot, still shivering and barely able to speak, says, “Awk, yea, yea, sure, sure, but I have just one question.”

The woman says, “Yes?”

The parrot says, “Awk . . . what did the turkey do, ask for a blow job?”

**Sometimes I get too angry.** Something bad happens to me or someone I love. Then, I get extremely angry at the person or people that caused that bad thing to happen.



## My car got towed and it sucked



My car got towed a week ago. I drove some friends and myself to a restaurant near us. But, there were no available parking spots in this restaurant’s parking lot. So, we parked in the nearby [McDonald’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s) parking lot. Little did we know there were a couple of well-hidden signs warning people they would get towed if they wrongfully parked in the McDonald’s lot.



So, my car got towed. One of my other friend’s cars got towed as well. It felt super shitty. I had to pay $325 to remove my car from impound. Luckily for me, my friends chipped in to help cover the $325. Things ended up not being too bad. However, I became irate when the tow company employee came up to my friend and me to tell us that our cars had been towed.



The employee who told us our cars had been towed was an asshole. He enjoyed telling us that we’d have to pay $325 to get our cars back. This man talked about how he had gotten great pictures of our cars being wrongfully parked because it was still light out when he took them. He happily told us that we wouldn’t be able to pick up our cars until Monday even though they had been towed on Saturday.



*In the face of this mean-spirited, unkind man, I lost it and got really angry.* My friend whose car also got towed lost it as well. Some of our friends who were there became irate too. In the moment it felt so, so good to get mad at this man. It felt good to yell at him and tell him he had no decency. In the day and a half after my car got towed it still felt really good to talk about the shittyness of the tow company and its employee.



However, after a certain point, it no longer felt good to be so angry at the tow company or its mean employee. **Instead, it just felt embarrassing.** I felt embarrassed that I had yelled expletives at someone in public. I felt embarrassed that I had lost my composure to the point where I was mean and disrespectful to another human being. And, I had now wasted two days of my life being angry.



If I hadn’t been so angry or so filled with mean-spirited feelings towards the tow company, I would have been more productive. *Maybe I would have been productive to the point where I did $325 of work to remove my car from impound.* Or, maybe I would have only done $100 of work. Either way, feeling angry for a bit and then letting it go would have been a much healthier thing.



It’s healthy and good to feel angry from time to time. When someone is mean to you or something shitty happens, you should feel angry. But, it’s not healthy, good, or okay to take that anger out on someone else by being mean or disrespectful to them.



When you’re mean to someone who was mean to you, they’ll respond by being even meaner and more unkind to you. Responding to meanness with meanness only creates more meanness. And the world doesn’t need any more meanness or unkindness than it already has.



When my friends and I were mean to the tow company employee who had treated us poorly, he upped the ante by treating us even worse. What do you think happened at that point in the interaction? If you guessed that my friends and I were even more angry and mean to the tow truck employee, then you were right.



**Again, being mean felt good in the moment, but I was disgusted with myself in the long run.** My parents had taught me that “two wrongs don’t make a right.” Yet, I had tried to fix a wrong by committing a wrong myself and found out that two wrongs just make everyone feel worse.



## Disarm meanness with kindness



If someone is mean to you, it’s okay to be angry at that person. But, it’s not productive to be mean back to them. Instead of being mean to someone who was mean to you, be kind to them. *If you respond to someone’s meanness with kindness, you will likely throw them off guard and disarm them.* In fact, the person who was being unkind to you may start to treat you with a lot more kindness. Here’s an example:



Recently I posted one of [my articles](http://jackkaufman.net/be-like-louis-ck-increase-revenue-by-using-comedian-marketing/) to [r/standupcomedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/). The article was received well, but one person wrote angry/unkind comments about it. Instead of responding to these angry/unkind comments with my own anger, I responded to them with kindness.



I was mad at the people who wrote mean comments under my post. But I didn’t respond to these people with anger or meanness. I took a few moments to collect myself and responded as kindly as I could.



If I had provoked the proverbial beasts by responding to their meanness with my own unkindness, the result wouldn’t have been good. The commenters would have felt badly. They also would have likely lashed out at me in anger, which would have made me feel badly too.



After responding to the mean commenters with kindness, they either didn’t respond or responded with kindness as well. A tense and potentially destructive situation became a constructive one.



**It’ll be tough for you to be kind when people are mean to you.** After all, when people belittle your work, personality, appearance, or other personal characteristics, it hurts. It’s natural to want to hurt the people who hurt you. But, if you uplift the people who hurt you instead, you will be happier and you’ll make someone else’s life better.



Feel the anger you need to feel in a constructive, private, and kind way after someone is mean to you. *Then, respond to their hurtful actions with kind actions.* It may seem counterintuitive, but you’ll live a better life by following this piece of advice.

Hello NoSleep. 

My  name is Danica Robins, I'm new here, and I'm here to share my story. I was quite hesitant to post this on here, considering thinking about this part of my life makes me sad, I was afraid of feeling guilty of postin this. Is this what he would have wanted?



August 19th 2015.

It was the first day of school. I was becoming a sophomore in high a school. I reunited with all my school friends again that day. My best friends Tracy, Catherine, and Jack. It was nice to be with once again, I wasn't really able to see them much during the summer since I was taking summer school in the morning for a failed Geometry class (math and I don't mix). And an accounting class at night school. Seeing them again after a long summer made me very happy.



A week later.

As you know. When in Highschool and you see an attractive guy when you're with your friends, well there was one guy who caught my eye, however, when I was walking alone through the halls and because I was alone, I didn't get that giggly feeling I get when I am typically with friends. The guy was very handsome. He was tall, dark haired, he was muscular, but not too buff, and had soul darting green eyes. I had never seen him prior to this time in the hallway. I later on told my friends about him, and as always, they were very interested in seeing him. The problem is I didn't know where to find him, so I just had to let that go up to chance.



November 2015

At my school, we were having a food drive for lesser fortunate families who may go hungry on thanksgiving. Though I usually dislike volunteer work. I had to do it this time because if I did, I would have gotten extra credit in my English class.

What I pretty much did was stand by a large pot full of canned foods brought in my people, and waited for people to bring their donations to the pot, and whenever they did, I had to give them a "Superstar" sticker. It was more exhausting than it sounds. Then it happened, I saw him, the green eyed guy. He brought in 2 canned mash potatoes, and a can of pumpkin pie. I was taken back when I saw him, so much so, I nearly forgot to give him a sticker. And when I did, he thanked me for the sticker, and all I could murmur out was "You....you...'re uh wel...come".

I was greatly embarrassed by this. 



December 2015

Everything was quite stressful the last week of the first semester . It was final's week, and my Chemistry grade hung in the balance of the final grade. I started spending much of my time studying in a library not far from my house. As I was studying, I felt a tap on my shoulder, I told around and..... It was him, the handsome green eyed guy. He said to me "Hey. You go to the same school as me don't you, you go to....." (I'm leaving out the name out of my school for privacy reasons.) I responded with a yes, in an extremely subtle voice. He said "Studying for finals? That's what I'm doing here, I'm picking up a studying guide for my psychology course, the teacher is quite a nutcase". "How so?" I asked. "He believes some weird conspiracy shit that aliens formed our psyche and have the ability to remove it or reshape it, and that mental illness is a result of this. He bases his tests off the textbook, but it's still weird, y'know?" 



He found his study book eventually. And he sat with me and asked if I would mind him studying with me, I said no. By the next hour or so, I learned less about chemistry and more about him. He was very interesting. His name was Cole, he told me he was from Canine, Montana and that he grew up in a house very distant from his neighbors house, so it was always very lonely. He was online schooled, and only really left the house when he went to collect wood in fall to prepare firewood for winter. He lived with his mother only, and he didn't specify why his father wasn't around, but I assumed it was death, since he never said that his parents were divorced. Though I guess death is like a divorce....



We couldn't exchange numbers, as he said he didn't have a phone. Since his mother feared the phone radiation would kill him. I found that odd, but I didn't tell him that of course. As the library was preparing to close, he said to me "Well, it was very nice talking to you Danica. If I don't run into you this week. Have a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. And I didn't run into him during that week, not once. 



January 2016.

School resumed and I was eager. A New Year, a new semester, I felt like it was a fresh start. I was very hopeful of running into Cole the first day of school. I really wanted to introduce him to my friends, to show him off in a way. I could show my friends that I was capable of being able to talk to such an attractive guy. Much to my luck, he found me at the beginning of lunch. "Hey Danica! How you have you been? How was your winter break?" I responded "I'm doing well and winter break was great. You can tell me about your's when I bring you to my table", he said "Okay then haha". I walked him over to the table in which my friends and I sat. I expected their expressions to change when they saw me walk over with such a handsome guy. But it was like they didn't notice him. "Tracy, Catherine, Jack, this is Cole", then Cole said "It's very nice to meet all of you". A long pause occurred, before I broke the silence and said "guys don't be rude, say hi to Cole, he's very nice". Tracy them confronted me with "I don't know who you are talking about", "Yeah, sorry Danica, but this isn't your funniest joke, haha", said Catherine, Jack just looked at me with a concerned expression on his face.

I was getting angry.



I yelled at Tracy "No, what are you talking about? Don't you see the guy standing right here!! He literally just said hi to you". "Don't worry Danica, a lot of people are intimidated by me for my height, I understand if your friends don't want to------". Tracy interrupted with "Danica, seriously, what are you talking about? There is literally no one within your vicinity besides us. This is a stupid joke". I could tell she was upset that I shouted at her. But I was just really confused, it's not like them for them to mess with me like this, or even with a stranger for that matter. I told Cole "You know what, don't worry about it, just sit here next to me. And he did so. The rest of lunch was dead silent, with Tracy and Catherine murmuring to each other a few times. 



A week later.

We all had made plans to go to watch "The Revenant". I invited Cole when I saw him during a nutrition break. And he said he'd love to join. I apologized to him for the rudeness of my friends, and told him they were just shy because they found him very attractive. They never said this, they never admitted to him being there, but I knew it was the reason why. 



Usually, I'm the first one to arrive at our destination when going somewhere. But to my surprise, Cole beat me there, "Hey Danica, ready to watch 'The Revenant'", "Yes! I hope they get here soon, I don't want to have to hold seats for too long, and the longer they take, the longer the concession line will be. Do you want popcorn?", "Nah. I don't the food here, too unhealthy".  When they got there, they once again, completely disregarded Cole's existence. But something happened during the night that really put me off. The ticket checker, he didn't check Cole for a ticket.

 

April 2016.

During the course of time between now and last January. Cole and I became very close. We actually started dating. But I don't allow him near my friends anymore. An incident happened when all my friends and I went to a restaurant for my friend Catherine's birthday dinner. When I asked Cole what he was going to order, Tracy yelled and caused a scene on me in the restaurant, she said "Ok Danica, enough of this! This is getting ridiculous, Cole isn't fucking real! You're not supposed to have imaginary friends at this age, Danica!". I gave her the silent treatment for two week after that until she eventually apologized.  But at the restaurant, the waitress completely ignored Cole.



May 2016.

I decided it was time to introduce Cole to my parents. After all, it was long overdue and he was a very nice, and intelligent guy, I couldn't think of anything my parents would dislike about him. Dinner was made, and while I was setting up plates on the table, there was a knock on the door. I answered it and it was Cole. He was a bit overdressed for such an occasion, he was wearing a tuxedo, but I guess he really wanted to make an impression. "Hey! Welcome to my home! Make yourself comfortable, don't go in the kitchen though. I don't want you to go in until I'm finished setting" "Alright" he chuckled "I'm looking very much forward to meeting your parents, hopefully they like me".



My father had just gotten home only five minutes after Cole's arrival. I forgot to mention earlier, that Cole never specified how he got places when we would go anywhere, like to the restaurant, I had asked how he got there and he shrugged, this was always his response, and I never thought much of it.  

He walked into the kitchen, and asked "Food ready yet?", he asked, I said "Hey dad, you saw Cole on the couch, didn't you? What do you think?"  "I didn't see anyone on the couch." I thought Cole was probably just in the bathroom. After everything was complete, the setting the food (venison steak with mashed  potatoes) and the food was served on the pearlescent white dishes. I went into the living room to get Cole, and he was there. I motioned him to the kitchen. When we walked in together. I enthusiastically said "MOM, DAD, SO THIS IS COLE!". "Very nice to meet you Mr and Mrs.Robins!" He happily said with a smile, he stuck out his hand to shake my father's hand. There was a pause.



My dad completely disregarded his handshake, and after a few moments, he  said "Where is he?". I shook, I said "Dad, what are you talking about? He's right here in front of you!". And surely Cole was. I was so angry, how could this happen again? Cole always showed up next to me in pictures, but only I was able to see him in the pictures we took together. My mother drew a concerned face at me "Danica, is everything ok?" I yelled, teary eyed "No! No one ever pays attention to Cole! They treat him like he doesn't exist and he does! I can physically touch him! Right here, see??". "Honey, there's no one there. This is a silly Joke Danica, you aren't 10, it's time for you to grow up". 



June 2016

My parents' concern grew every passing day, whenever I said I talked to Cole. I eventually stopped telling them about him, but I know they knew otherwise. They made an appointment for me to go see a psychiatrist in July.



July

I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, I was given prescription pills that would make all symptoms of schizophrenia to go away. I talked to Cole about it's here's how the conversation went. 



Cole: You need to take those pills.



Me: No.



Cole: Why?



Me: If I do, I'll lose you forever.



Cole: Danica. I love you and because I love you so much, I want you to be able to live a normal life. And you can't have that when I'm in it.



Me: Why would I want to live a normal life? When I can spend an abnormal life with you".



August 2016

The pills were forced down me by parents, as they were being forced down, I saw Cole behind them, waving goodbye. His darting green eyes killing me, cause I knew it was the last time I would ever see them, and it was.

*Thanks to /u/BookWyrm17 for the [prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/586odt/wp_this_morning_your_cat_vanished_without_a_trace/).*



---



Sonia paced back and forth through the room, trying to think of any other place the the cat could've hid in. Having checked the cauldrons, the herb cabinet, and every single one of her cloaks a few times each, she was running out of ideas. With a frustrated groan, the girl collapsed onto the bed. She took another look at the various tomes opened on information about search charms, but her mind refused to process the complex rune arrangements and archaically named ingredients. All of the easy ones either hadn’t worked or required a piece of the “object” in question. Without any warning, a furry black body fell right on top of Sonia, hissing loudly.



“Oscar!” she shouted, squeezing him tightly. “Why did you hide? If Madam Anna found out I lost you, she’d kick me out for sure!”



Sonia held the furry creature on outstretched arms. The smile on her face changed into a frown.



“Well? I’m waiting for an answer.”



She was prepared for another lecture on how an ancient spirit so graciously helping her as an assistant didn’t need to answer that, but the cat only meowed in response. 



“Oh, you’re not going to get away with just that. Come on, out with it! I spent the entire day looking for you. That disappearing trick you pulled in the morning was really mean.”



The girl’s questions and accusations were met with only more seemingly confused meowing. No matter how much she tried, Sonia could not get a single coherent word out of her once so talkative companion.



“This looks bad.” She let out a deep sigh. “Seems like we’ll need to go see her anyway. Come on, Oscar.”



Sonia carefully lowered the cat to the floor, put on her new green cloak, and routinely filled its inner pockets with a few useful herbs. Stopping by the door, she took one glance at the mirror. Her short brown hair was neatly combed as usual. The cloak matched her eyes and, after the few cuts she had given it yesterday, fit pretty well. Sonia was short, even for her age, so not many believed she was really an apprentice to a witch as famous as Madam Anna. Even the signature brooch in the form of a sparrow was not enough to convince some people. Wasting no more time, she carefully picked Oscar up again, and stepped out of the door of her hut.



The giant oaks stood proudly around her, obscuring what little light the evening sun provided. As a few droplets of rain hit the girl’s face, she groaned, quickly tucked the cat under her cloak, and pulled her hood up. Though the trees made it hard to see the path, they thankfully also stopped a large portion of the rain. Sonia wasn’t afraid of losing her way, not even in the twilight around her. Madam Anna made sure her apprentice knew the forest very well and could take care of herself, even if that meant leaving a young girl alone several days of walking away from the nearest village. Compared to some of the lessons, this journey was almost pleasant.



After a good hour of navigating the little paths and trails, Sonia stood in front of an old house on the edge of a small clearing. It looked as if it had grown into the forest itself. The walls merged with the trees behind it, and the moss, which grew on the dark wood, gradually molded with the thick grass on the ground. Smoke spiraled out of the chimney, rising far up to the sky. The girl took a few deep breaths, nodded to herself and approached the large oaken door.



The first few knocks were ignored. Sonia followed up with another series of frantic hits on the wood. Still, no one answered. As she raised her hand for another attempt, the girl heard a familiar low-toned yet distinctly feminine voice, speaking slowly and articulating each word.



“If you make another noise, I won’t hesitate to turn you into the most hideous creature I can devise. And whoever you are, I assure you my imagination far surpasses yours. Now leave, I do *not* accept visitors this late.”



“Madam Anna, it’s me, Sonia,” the girl answered, hugging Oscar a bit too tightly under her cloak.



Something resembling an annoyed sigh creeped through the cracks in the door, followed by the sounds of footsteps. The door swung open and Sonia felt a rush of hot heavy air wash over her. Madam Anna looked like a woman in her early thirties, but that was nowhere near true. Curvy figure, smooth skin, well-shaped face, Sonia had heard many remarks on her mentor’s beauty, even if it was rarely in the woman’s presence. Some put down that appearance to witchcraft, but the truth was much more simple. The slight blue tint of her skin, the almost unnoticeable backwards curve of her ears, and the nearly unbearable hotness of the room betrayed it. Fae folk enticed humans with their looks from ancient times after all, and even a half-blood possessed a part of that power.



The woman was dressed in a simple black dress that matched the colour of her hair. In her right hand she held an opened letter, in the left — the end of a pipe nearly half as long as Sonia’s arm. Her grip on both was relaxed, almost lazy. The mouthpiece of the pipe was held firmly between the witch’s milky-white teeth. Higher than most human men and women, Madam Anna practically loomed over the young girl, staring her down with her amber eyes.



“You’d better have a good reason,” she said, squinting her eyes.



“I think something’s wrong with him.” Sonia pulled Oscar out from under her outdoor clothing, prompting an annoyed meow from the animal. “He disappeared for most of the day. I only found him about an hour ago and he hasn’t said a word since.”



Staring directly at the cat, Madam Anna tapped the pipe with her index finger a few times. Oscar returned the glare silently. Finally, she sighed again, stepped away from the door, and took the pipe out of her mouth.



“Come in. You know how much I hate the cold.”



Sonia rushed inside and closed the heavy door behind her. The entire back wall of the room, except for a small door leading further into the house, was taken up by a fireplace roaring with an unnatural blue flame that didn’t even char the wood. The heat instantly made Sonia sweaty. She took off the cloak and hung it up beside the entrance. The rest of the walls were lined with bookcases and cabinets. Many jars, full of rare and powerful ingredients, stood on the shelves, waiting for their time and place to save a life or take one. A few bronze cauldrons with an assortment of tools stood in the corner. Sonia often wondered how expensive they were, but iron was obviously not an option for someone with fae folk blood.



“So, you’re saying he’s been silent for all this time?” The witch had already left the letter and the pipe on the small table by the fireplace and was rummaging through one of the cabinets.



“Yes, aside from meowing and hissing that is.”



The half-fae placed the empty palm of her right hand before her lips and lightly puffed. A blue flame began dancing above it, encircled with glowing runes. Sonia watched with bated breath. By now, she was well familiar with witchcraft, the magic of using rare and carefully prepared ingredients by boiling, burrowing, or burning. It relied on the combination of the arcane runic language and the primal elements of fire, water, or earth to draw out power sleeping within the components.



Yet what unfolded before Sonia was something much more rare: a combination of witchcraft with sorcery, the wild and dangerous art of fae folk that commanded the primal elements through sheer force of will. Where human witches would have to rely on tools inscribed with a limited array of runes to ignite the ingredients, Madam Anna commanded the fire itself to draw the formula for her. This ability is what had earned the half-fae witch her fame, and unfortunately for Sonia, it was the only thing that couldn’t be taught.



As the fire on her palm calmed down, the witch threw the prepared mixture of herbs into it and watched thick clouds of smoke weave around her arm. After a few seconds, they formed into a serpentine creature. The smoke beast slid off to the ground and slithered towards Oscar. As it lapped around Oscar’s neck, Sonia rushed to him, but Madam Anna firmly held her by the shoulder. Soon the serpent left the black cat, who was now looking even more confused, and returned to its summoner. She gently picked it up and brought up to her face. Having hissed something into the woman’s ear, the creature dissipated back into a dark cloud.



“Well, this is unusual,” Sonia’s mentor said after a long pause. “The spirit is growing weaker and weaker. If this continues, he’ll die and all that will be left is the cat he once were. A familiar summoned by me should not disappear so easily.”



“I…” Sonia felt her heart beating faster. “I didn’t do anything! I swear! I would never—”



“Of course you didn’t,” the half-fae scoffed. “You’re not even a witch yet. It would take much more than that to meddle with my work. Besides, I’ve seen similar signs of… weakening in other charms and hexes of mine. Someone or something is interfering.”



After a long silence Sonia didn’t dare to disrupt, the woman continued:



“In any case, I don’t have the time for this. I’ve received an invitation to the capital, the royal palace to be exact.” She pointed at the letter still lying on the table. “In any other situation, I would ignore such a thinly-veiled order, but the issue is a time-sensitive one and may have consequences I simply can’t ignore.”



“So, he’ll have to stay like this until you return? But...” Sonia crouched down to pick up Oscar again. “What if he can’t make it?”



For the first time since Sonia entered the room, Madam Anna smiled.



“Must you always rely on me, Sonia?” she asked with a slight chuckle.



“Wh-what do you mean?”



“Take matters into your own hands. North from here, in the Spearhead Mountains, lives my old friend Alkor. If he can’t help you, I’m not sure even I can. The trip shouldn’t be a problem for you.” The smile quickly faded from the witch’s face. “Or am I wrong?”



Sonia gulped. Spearhead Mountains were farther than anywhere she had ever been from the forest. Furthermore, the road lay through Dead Man’s Bog and a few towns in the lands of Marhur where witchcraft was punishable by death. She felt that familiar sinking feeling that came over her each time her mentor gave her a new seemingly impossible goal, but Sonia knew what refusing would mean. Many others were probably eagerly waiting to fill her shoes.



“I’ll do it,” she said, trying to stop her hands from shaking.



“I admire your enthusiasm.” Madam Anna picked up her pipe and reignited it. “But you’ll need at least this to find him.”



The witch reached into another cabinet, pulled out a shining object, and tossed it towards Sonia. It was a scale like that of a snake or a lizard, but as big as the girl’s hand and seemingly made out of solid gold. Though she never held one personally, Sonia recognized it straight away.



“Does this mean your friend is a...”



“Dragon? Yes, they are quite knowledgeable in these matters.”



The girl suppressed a yelp.



“Don’t be scared, Sonia. He won’t touch my apprentice; I’ve told him all about you.”



“You…” Sonia’s eyes went wide. “You talked about me with your old friend? And a dragon no less?”



“Don’t get cocky. He was curious, so I told him. That’s it.” The fae put on her velvet cloak and began packing ingredients into it. “Oh, you’ll probably also need this.”



The woman reached behind one of the cabinets and pulled out an object resembling a lamp and a small pouch. The upper part of the device looked like a glass flask with holes for adding ingredients and letting out smoke. The lower part consisted of a bronze tripod and several large rotatable discs with runes carved into them. All in all, it was unmistakably a witchcraft lamp, which meant the pouch was likely full of ignition agent.



“You know earth witchcraft well and your brewing is adequate, not that you will be able to lug a runed cauldron around on your way to the mountains.” The witch handed the items to Sonia. “Time for you to get some practice with this too.”



“Does that mean?” The girl carefully took the lamp, as if it was made of the most delicate material imaginable.



“Of course not! Make it back, show me what you’ve learned, and maybe you’ll earn the right to call yourself a witch. Until then, you’re still just an apprentice.” She checked the pockets of her cloak one more time. “I suppose I should get going. You can take anything else you need from the house.”



The woman walked up to the front door, opened it, and stopped for a second.



“The road is dangerous, so stay safe out there, Sonia.” For a moment her voice got a bit softer than usual, but soon the half-fae regained her composure. “I’d be ashamed if my apprentice died so easily.”



Having said that, Madam Anna walked out into the dwindling rain, leaving Sonia and Oscar alone.

I understand that biodiversity helps promote the continuation of life through increased chances of survival in case of some sudden calamitous event. But whats the point of saving last few members of a dying race, especially if they don't have any beneficial uses to humanity? If anything, just preserve DNA/fluid samples for future reference. I don't mean to be insulting but objectively, it does seem like resources could better be utilized elsewhere.

I'm military taking home 48k a year. I'm a new homeowner. Car fully paid off. 5k in savings. Credit card is paid off in full every month. Looking to get 30k for home improvements, the largest of which will be solar panels (won't go through the solar company's lender for unrelated reasons).  Credit score is about 750. My finances are pretty solid, but I just want to know what lenders would be the best options to apply for an unsecured loan without having to drain my credit score by applying a bunch of times. Any advice would be appreciated.

**My 5 Questions:**



1. How did you get chosen?

2. Were you paid?

3. Did you believe the doubt before you investigated?

4. Did you really investigate anything substantial?

5. What did you do with what you found out?

As he was looking for valuables he heard someone say "Jesus is watching you".   

Shocked, he turns on his flashlight and sees a parrot. He asks the parrot if he was the one talking. The parrot says "Yes". Amused, the burglar asks the parrot its name, to which the parrot replies "Moses".  

The burglar is surprised, and asks "What kind of people names their parrot Moses?"

The parrot looks at the pair of glowing eyes behind the robber and says, "The same kind of people who names their pitbull Jesus."



P.s. Sorry for sucky English.

I'm 21 years old. And up until 3 days ago I'd never "dealt" with periods.



I was with a friend and we were talking when she started having blood run down her legs. She ran to the bathroom and was really embarrassed. Meanwhile I just sorta stood there holding her handbag.



I had no clue how to react. She was obviously embarrassed. Basically I'm asking for advice as to what the women of twox would like a male friend to do in the case of one of these emergencies in case it ever happens again.



I just want to be supportice and helpful and i have absolutely no clue what I could do in these situations.

I watched my country postseason baseball game today, this is the case really confuse me. Apparently in video catcher hold the cut-off return pass earlier that the runner came in home. I didn't follow MLB a lot, the commentator said this rule is copied from MLB. If this is a good call in Major league?

...but I just locked it and sat there in complete silence.

After 20 seconds he knocked again, but I just continued to ignore it.

The knocks got louder and more frequent but I was determined not to move in the hope that he would just go away.

Then he decided to look through the window.

He shouted, "Do you think I'm stupid? I can see you in there, sir. Open the door."

I said, "You're not coming in mate!"

He said, "I don't want to come in, I just want you to step out of the car."

I'm currently in university and thinking about some topics I can do research about. I've been enamored by the use of statistics in baseball. I was thinking of trying to incorporate MLB statistics in a possible study in the future.



What are stats do you think is indicative of a player's skills (WAR, etc)? What stats could I check into for a possible injury (i.e. lower avg fastball) and what stats should I be wary of when comparing players?



If this infringes on the community rules, I apologize.

This happened last night, I'm a restless sleeper to begin with but last night I was a holy terror. I fell asleep first and he came to bed after me. Right as he started to fall asleep I punched him in the face while I was still sound asleep to which he responded by yelling "what the fuck" and shoving me. I woke up startled as to why I was being shoved and yelled at.



tl;dr I had a nightmare and punched my fiancé in the face

I work 8-5 Monday through Friday. I'm 30 and it took me years to get a decent job with that shift, but having a consistent sleep and work schedule is EXTREMELY helpful if you want to be more alert and productive throughout the day.



My alarm goes off at 4:40 every morning, even on my days off. Sometimes I roll around and snooze for an hour, but I'm usually out of bed by 6. I don't actually need an alarm anymore, I've been on this sleep schedule for a couple years and my body just wakes up automatically at the same time, my alarm just serves as a reminder of the time.



Soooo much less stressful if you just always wake up at the same time. My coworkers spend the first 2 hours of their day chugging coffee desperately trying to pull themselves out of a deep sleep, while I'm at full alert the moment I clock in without ever drinking coffee.



Now the sacrifice you gotta make is you gotta listen to your body when you get tired. Sometimes I'm about to conk out by 8 pm, other nights I end up awake until midnight. Still wake up automatically at the same time, like my biological clock has it's own alarm programmed in now.



The phrase "early to bed early to rise" etc etc definitely has some meaning to me.

OK so I was watching pirates of the caribbean for the first time in a while, I don't remember a lot about when I first saw the movie, except for when the pirates first invade Port Royal, and they go knocking on Elizabeth's door and shoot the servant. I distinctly remember them shooting a female servant, but watching it now it's male. Am I just crazy or did they make some kind of change?

Don't know where to post. My recent marriage has completely broken down (couples counselling, separate bedrooms, sex once since the wedding, complete disconnect on all levels, he knows I want a separation) and I started a course in counselling and psychotherapy. Not the ideal time but I wanted to do it and it gives me focus. Anyway, we have small group projects.  So it's me and two guys doing a project. One guy is 14 years older than me (no biggie),  well-read, funny, has gorgeous hands, totally on my wavelength with the worldview. I have an absolute burning, yearning desire to be kissed by him. It's all-consuming. It's weird though, seeing as how I'm still married but am dying to feel this man's lips on mine. Have you ever felt this?Advice/thoughts/feedback welcome!

I was trying to ask google "what is the terminal velocity of an apple" to determine if it would be deadly.  

Then I thought that I can reduce this if I know it's symbol, to something like 'x of an apple'.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity



We see that 'Vt' is terminal velocity. I don't know how to express it properly.



But I don't know what this.. subscript thing is.  

So if we have "four times times four times four times four", we can verbally say, "4 to 4th power",  

and reduce its expression to, "4 ^ 4".  

So if we have 'Vt', our verbal input would be, "V <something> t", and its reduced expression would be, "V <something else> t"  



&nbsp;  

Hope I explained that right.  

What is <something>? What is <something else>? How would I express it verbally?  

And more importantly, what is this subscript thing in math at all?

Hey guys,

So I'm a Swede who just moved over from the UK to America.

Back in Sweden it's not really a big thing to have a credit card and I never got around to getting one during my years living in London. So bottom line is I don't think I have a credit at all (don't know how this works really, hence the ELI5). 



Here's the question. What should I do to build a good credit (preferably pretty fast) and how do I get into the market? Read somewhere that you need a credit to get a credit card, which is a bit of a catch 22 for me.  



It might be good to know that my wife is American and she has a good credit. We both already work and both have pretty good salaries. It might be some way to piggy back her to get started?



I'm banking with Bank of America but will probably get a credit card from somewhere else with a better cash back or travel deal.



Any help and Do's and Don'ts would be much appreciated.



Huge thanks!

Phone rings:  Answer without listening and say "Sorry, I'm expecting a call." and hang up.

 

Phone rings:  Again, "Sorry, I'm expecting a call." and hang up.  



Third time:  Before person can say anything, the caller quickly says "How do you know this isn't the call?" 



Respondent:  "It's too early.  The call is supposed to be tonight."

I'm a teacher in Illinois and this has and will be my only career. I plan to put in my 35 years of teaching and retire. Since I've started, I've been told not to trust the pension system and not expect my pension. This seems a bit of hyperbole. 



How do I evaluate the risk of the whole thing somehow going under? Or not getting a fraction of what was promised? I've put in 9% of my salary towards my pension every year (some people don't know this.) There have been several attempts to reduce pension benefits, but these have been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional as the IL constitution says you can't reduce a pensioners benefit. States can't go bankrupt, right? 



So right now I'm maxing out my Roth IRA and my 403(b), partially so that when I need more cash flow I can contribute less and partially because I know I won't get social security and if something happens to pension, I would be completely screwed if I had no other retirement savings. But now I'm worried I'll have the combination "problem" of having too much saved for retirement and not having as much spending money now. We live comfortably and within our means. 



My question (or in just interested in hearing people's thoughts on, as no one can tell the future) is: what are the chances of me not getting my full pension? Is it silly to save so much for retirement now and worry about the pension? Which would I regret more: saving too much now and paying the opportunity cost of not as much cash flow now, or not saving enough now and something happening to the pension when I want to retire?

The musical is about classical composers and they need three boys to play the leads.



The first boy comes in and says he wants the part of Beethoven. His name is marked down and he leaves.



The second boy comes in and says he wants the part of Mozart. His name is marked down and he leaves. However, the last boy rushes in too early and they aren't ready for him.



"You have to go out and wait for your name to be called." They say to him.



"Fine," he says.



"But I'll be Bach."

This is the full story of another comment I made:



This was when I was in college in 1997 - But whatevs... I seriously fucked this girl up.



I'd met a girl on IRC (Don't judge it was the chat medium of the era)



We talked for a bit and finally decided to meet up.  We went to colleges 2.5 hours away from one another, and she agreed to come pick me up from my folks place, close to her school because I had a ride to/from home that weekend. (She had a car, I didn't)



We met up and all was going well.  We drove down to her college and had a great evening together cuddling and watching TV, etc.



That next morning, we  decided to have a little bit of sexytime before she gave me a ride back home.



I was going down on her, and my sinuses were really clogged up. I started to gag and well... I ran to the trash can and ralphed.  Needless to say, she thought it was her.



I tried to explain, but she was hysterical.  It was everything I could do just to calm her down.



Nothing, and I mean NOTHING I said could change her mind...    The ride home was joyous to say the least.



Between sobs:



> "My pussy isn't gross! There's no way My pussy makes you sick!" 



> I can't believe you threw up going down on me.."



> "I swear I wash it daily"



> "I'm not on my period!"



> "My pussy isn't nasty"



Oh lawd... I had to listen to this shit for an hour, and tried to salvage the situation when we were at stoplights.. This was beyond the point of making up with her.



She dropped me off, I apologized profusely, she peeled out of my driveway.



One of the worst days of my life up into that point.



Back at school - I got bombarded with messages and emails from her friends telling me how much I hurt her and how dare anyone do something like that to such a sweet girl, she had to go to a therapist due to the shit I put her through... etc.



TL;DR -  Met up with a girl from the internet, went down on her and my horrible sinus issues gagged me and made me puke.  Girl thought it was her; permanently scarring her.

Or in family films, when adults fall in love or something there is really obvious mooning, or if they have a plan they spell it out out loud, bad characters are very obviously bad- stuff like this, the adults are incapable of acting subtly like what real life adults do.



How come kids don't know these aren't realistic portrayals of adult behaviour and why is it so heavily obvious? shouldn't kids be able to understand more without being spoon-fed by that age? do kids not appreciate any mystery? 



there are some exceptions, obviously. but examples of what I mean are when two adults in a film will be romantically involved and they talk over each other about how they both love the same thing and/or they stare with a lovestruck look on their face.

This is in response to a comment that was made exactly one year ago by /u/Alienm00se:



https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3pro4r/goodbye_middle_class_51_percent_of_all_american/cw90j8y/



He speculated that the market is headed for a crash, and it was a good idea to sell out of large caps over the next year and start investing in hedge positions to shield against the crash. He also speculated that gold is going to possibly drop to $850/ounce, and it would be a good buy when it drops below $1050. I set a reminder to see where we are a year later.



Well, guess what happened? No surprise here. 



The closing price of the S&P 500 on 10/21/2015 was ~~$2018~~ $2052. 



The closing price on 10/21/2016 was $2141.



The S&P 500 is actually up ~~6%~~ 4.3% even after the tumultuous roller coaster ride we've had this year. Certainly, ~~6%~~ 4.3% pales in comparison to the raging bull market we've had where we've seen it soar 20% in one year. However, it is still a decent return. Periodically selling off during the past year would have resulted in missing out on those gains as well as possibly locking in some losses since we had a few months where the market fell and then rebounded.



[Gold did not go below $1050 once all year. The lowest it was all year was exactly $1050.80 on Dec 17, 2016.](http://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html) Today it is $1266. That being said, [I still do not recommend gold as an investment](http://www.aaii.com/files/images/articles/9298-figure-1.jpg).



[The most prudent advice is, as Warren Buffett recommends, invest in low-cost index funds, and invest long term.](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/08/10/why-warren-buffett-thinks-putting-your-money-her-2.aspx)



Your buddy who's got a hot stock pick? Forget it. Some conspiracy theorist on reddit says the market is overvalued and headed for a crash? Not a chance. Buy index, hold long, don't try to time the market.



S&P Historical closing data source: http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx/historical



EDIT: I had the original value wrong. It was $2052, not $2018.

Long story short, I received a mail from ARS collections in the mail. I called them to get an idea as to what this was about. They then respond with, "We're a collections agency, we don't do any reporting to the bureaus."



So few questions:



1. Is it possible to collect debt not on your credit report?

2. If it isn't getting reported, could it one day be reported?

3. Should I repay this any way?

When I add an egg to fried rice or noodle dish, it just tastes and looks like I added a scrambled egg to my dish.  When I get it at a restaurant it tastes much different, and has a much different texture.



Any tips?

So, for the last couple weeks I've had some *thing* on the end of my tongue. I'm clumsy and bite my tongue/lips/cheeks pretty often, so initially I shrugged it off as a skin tag/flap that would heal on its own. 



It didn't. 



Last night I could feel it and in my anxiety at having this *thing* on my tongue, I tried tugging at it. It was about a centimeter long, pure white, and seemed to stretch when I got a grip on it- which isn't easy given the slippery nature of the tip of your tongue. It looked almost like a tiny white leech. 



After a bit of tugging it POPPED off. Great! Instant relief.



Then the overwhelming taste of copper.



My mouth was flooding with blood from a tiny hole on the tip of my tongue.



In my panic, I dropped the specimen into the sink and began vigorously swishing my mouth with water, dabbing my profusely bleeding tongue with a towel, anything to attempt to stymie the bleeding. 



Brushing my teeth seem to do the trick, and relieved I returned to my room and tried googling to figure out what the hell it was. 



I think it was some kind of worm, like a parasite worm. Oh **GOD**! That's one of my *worst* fears.



To be fair, I've done a bit of traveling (Hong Kong, major cities throughout Japan, Seoul, Tijuana, etc) and I *am* an adventurous eater. I've had raw beef, live shrimp, pig colon, shirako, raw horse, etc. it's absolutely within the realm of possibility that I ate something *infested* and have been harboring unwanted Hitchhikers for who knows how long. But finding one on my TONGUE?! Fucking gross, man! What the fuck?!



Now I'm feeling repulsed and paranoid at work until I can go to the doctor on my next day off. Visions of polyps in my brain or muscle haunt me. That day off won't come soon enough. 



TL;DR- found a weird white thing on my tongue. Pulled on it, it popped off and my tongue started bleeding profusely. I lost the specimen in my panic and am now convinced I have parasitic worms. No sample to show my doctor when I can get to her. Totally grossed out and panicked.

Hello Gaming, 



I have a lot of friends and family in my life that I believe would love today's consoles but just cannot get used to modern control functions. 



An example: My dad and my fiance both love grand theft auto, rocket league, etc. and after watching me play it for a few minutes, they would like to try. They can move around and look around, but just not at the same time. Add any other button combinations to basic maneuvering and they put the controller down and walk away. 



I'm looking for a simple game, or a very detailed tutorial that works on these tasks specifically.  Or if you have any other advice on overcoming these obstacles, please help where you can, thanks!

I'm starting a high yield savings account with Synchrony bank because there is no minimum deposit to start or upkeep the account and they have 1.05% interest rate. Seems like a no brainer to put about 200 a month or part of my bonuses into that account instead of doing a money market account. If I need to use the money, I can just transfer funds to my bank checking account. So tell me why a money market account would be a better option?  If I transfer money over, will there be a waiting period to use it? They said I can transfer up to $250,000 to my checking to be used. Only thing is I can't just write a check directly from that savings account because the purchase limit on it is $500/day. Any input is appreciated.

From my understanding we can only see in red, green and blue due to the cone cells in our eyes. Other animals however, like butterflies, can percieve many other colors, most of which we can't see.



But if our eyes are the only things stopping us from seeing other colors, would we be able to dream of or imagine other colors?

I am a junior in high school. Up until now, all of my classes had been extremely easy for me, even the AP Chem class I took as a sophmore. However, my grades have started to slip because my classes are getting difficult. I've never had to study before, but I'm really worried because my grades are slipping and I don't have any good study habits. Do you guys have any really good tips on how to study?

I've been married to my husband Chris for 5 years. I've always gotten along great with his family. His mom and dad are divorced. His mom has a second husband. His father is single. He has two brothers. I get along great with all of them. Chris is very close to his father. 



Recently, my FIL Tony put one of his properties up for sale. It is a bit run down and needed some TLC. He asked me if I would help out as I am an interior decorator. I work freelance so I cleared a whole week from my schedule just for him. For two days I went and met up with Tony at the property to help with redecorating and everything was fine as it always is. Chris came along on the first day but left for a work trip the following day.



The third day we were working on the kitchen. I was showing him some backsplash options when he suddenly grabbed my breast. Just randomly, out of nowhere, leaned forward and squeezed my left breast. He moved his hand away and I was a bit gobsmacked and didn't really know what to say. He just sat there looking at me. I eventually said "Tony, what the fuck?"



He didn't say anything and got up and started holding the backsplash samples and paint samples against the wall. I grabbed my phone and was about to get up and grab my bag and leave when I see Tony swinging the perspex backsplash sample board at me. He hit me in the head and I fell off my chair to the ground.



I think I blacked out for a few seconds. When I came to, he was leaning over me and his hands were up my shirt. I couldn't move and I could feel there was a cut on my head. I think I was involuntarily crying. He started pulling off my pants and as much as I tried to move I couldn't. My mouth wasn't working either. I felt paralyzed and I still can't work out if it was because of the blow to the head or because of what was being done to me. He ejaculated inside me then wiped his penis on my face. Then he pulled up his jeans and went outside.



I lay there on the kitchen floor unable to move. 4 hours passed but I didn't realize this at the time. Eventually Tony came back in. He was dirty from gardening. He grabbed me and stood me up and said "Go home." 



I pulled my clothes back on, grabbed my stuff and went to my car. I was really dizzy and I didn't want to drive but I didn't know what to do. I somehow made my way home. Twice I pulled over to try and steady myself and I clipped a bin pretty badly. 



When I got home I went and sat in the shower and cried. I scrubbed my vagina with soap until it was so tender I could no longer touch it. Then I went and got into bed and cried. I was still really dizzy and my head was throbbing. It was bleeding again from where I rubbed too hard drying off. I must have fallen asleep or passed out again because I woke with a start some time later to my phone ringing. It was Chris.



When I answered he was panicked. He said he'd been trying to call me for hours after Tony rang him to say I fell off the stepladder while painting. Then he scolded me for not having let Tony take me to the ER. He said he was coming back asap.



I started shaking with fear at how quickly Tony had made up a story to cover himself. And I realized I had stupidly washed away his semen and any evidence. 



Chris came back the next morning. He took me to the hospital and they put two stitches in the cut in my head. I haven't told him the truth. I haven't said much at all. He thinks I'm a bit concussed and keeps telling me to go to the doctor again. I haven't told anyone that I'm having trouble hearing from my right ear. I don't know what to do. Why did Tony do this? He has rung a few times to check how I'm doing and to say I should rest and not worry about the rest of the renovations. I washed away the evidence. How will Chris ever believe me? What do I do? Why did this happen?



Editing to share with you all the PM I just received from derpaderpderpaderp -



Subject: "I look another dumb cunt"



Message: "Wash away all the evidence and then wonder why rapists don't get prosecuted. Smooth move dumb ass. Good luck with anything now dumb bitch."

I read a sentence this morning (The last part of the sentence is the title) and looked up Ubiquity, for clarification. Essentially it means to be everywhere always, aka omnipresent. Take that thought, and form your own theories, I cant wait to read them!

Most people who go into near death experiences describe it as "peaceful uninterrupted sleep with no dreams"



Idk about you but i know a few people who often say "i wish i could just sleep all week" 



Verdict: Id rate death 5/10.



While it does seem nice to just "let it go". Being alive is sensational. Pain, agony, suffering, be thankful for it (i guess). After all, if we dead we dont get that sweet sweet hot water in the shower.

Hi ladies! I figured you'd know the best way to answer my question as I've always been helped by you in the past! 



I recently started sleeping with a guy and lost my virginity to him. He's wonderful and caring and I like him a whole lot! 

My question is though; when he fingers me, it feels like I need to pee after a while. Is that normal? I know I don't actually need to go as I'll try beforehand but will get nothing! I'm terrified of urinating in bed :( 



Any advice or help on what this could be?

The book was a thriller about Cold War Czechoslovakia.



Like many of his generation, he composed on the fly and stored the file in the cloud, but failed to back it up.



One day, he was horrified to see an apology letter from the storage company that their servers had all been destroyed in a natural disaster.  His novel was gone forever.



Goes to show you - don't write any Czechs you can't cache.

Quick question to the fine people of personal finance. I'm a 23 year old who has never had anything in their name so I never built credit. So I recently went on credit karma just to see what my score would look like, when I finish everything I see that my score is crap 552. So thinking that can't be right I notice I was sent into collection for a lab bill I never received in 2014 and that it's open. The bill is only $132 which I can pay easily, but I fear that my credit is now ruined. What do I do?

Hey

Could you give me some recommendations for movies which go along the lines of yip man, the Kung Fu series or mb even The Last Samurai. I have watched close to none of these fighting movies meaning I'm kind of a newbie and don't even know the famous ones. Just give me everything you have. Thx have a nice evening

This happened to me this summer. I'm a college student and I stayed in my college town this summer so that I could take a math class. I didn't really have any of my friends here and so there wasn't really much to do most of the time. Anyway, one night I decided that I would go to the gym pretty late, around 9:30. While I'm sitting in the parking lot, my roommate from last year calls me. She says that her and some of her friends are having a party at their apartment and that I should come. At first I was like, no way. I was about to go to the gym, I'm already here, I'm not going to skip it. But the more I thought about my lack of social outings during the summer, I figured I should go and that maybe it would be fun.



So I brought a half full six pack of Redds Wicked and half a fifth of fireball. I already went in with the mindset that I needed to get really drunk at this party to have fun since the only one I knew there was my roommate. So I beer-bonged all six of my Redds in like an hour and a half. I then proceeded to drink my fireball and share it with a couple people. So I drank all the alcohol I brought in about 2 hours. By the time this was all over, it was like 1 am and this is where I start forgetting shit. I fell asleep in the bathroom for like 20 minutes, and when I woke up, I guess I thought it was time to go home. This is the last thing I remember.



So apparently I tried to walk home. This isn't a big deal at all because my house was literally a 2 minute walk away. But I was so fucked up that I didn't make it. I woke up around 7 or 8 in the morning, laying in the grass of some random persons back yard. Obviously I started flipping shit because I didn't know where I was or what got me there, but I was also really happy I was okay (I know I fucked up majorly by passing out in public, especially since I'm a college aged female, and that's probably my most scary experience.) But anyway, I sprinted home almost as soon as I woke up.



After I took a shower, I realized I didn't have my cell phone. This was really a big deal because I realized I hadn't contacted my parents or my boyfriend yet at all and because I had to go to work later. So I sprinted back to where I passed out to see if I could find me phone. It was no where to be found so I started searching the streets, my roommates house, and every where I could have possibly been the previous night. I found nothing. My roommate started texting everyone that was at the party, and got no responses. I was freaking out. I had no idea what to do.



A couple hours later my roommate gets a call. This girl that plays softball at my school (that I literally met ONCE over a year ago) says she has my phone and to come pick it up. So I drove to her house to get it. She said the only reason she knew it was mine is that I kept getting calls from my boyfriend and she remembered he was my boyfriend. Apparently this girl found my phone while she was walking her dog on the side of the street and just picked it up. Honestly this was a really lucky thing to happen considering what COULD have happened.



So I drive back home and I'm in tears because of how lucky I feel. I get ready for work, grab all my shit, and head out to my car. I needed to get something out of my trunk (I own a jeep) and I set my phone on roof of my car while I'm grabbing it. I then slam my trunk door... and apparently my phone slid into the crack... and my truck door literally smashed my phone in half. So yeah that day I really fucked up. 



**TL;DR I got black out drunk instead of going to the gym, passed out in a random yard, lost my phone, found it again, and then broke it.**

Hi,



I'm thinking about buying a used keyboard. I don't really play, but I'd like to mess around in my free time, and maybe learn.

I live in an apartment, and don't want it to be loud, do my question is: 



Do keyboards come with a headphone jack, or Bluetooth capability so that only I can hear myself? If so, is it pretty standard, or is that something on more expensive keyboard?

I worked for 18 months in the UK and saved roughly 16000GBP. I transferred around 3k when I moved back to the US, but left 13000 in a UK bank account. I was stupid enough to follow the markets and believed the uptick in the exchange rate was a sign that Brexit would be a no. I'm now stuck with either transferring the money now and taking a rather large hit from the amount I was expecting to get or letting it sit a while longer and hope the exchange rate improves.



The money is in an ISA that earns roughly 0.5% interest. If I transferred it here, it would just go right into a non-retirement investment account. I don't foresee needing the money any time soon, so its really just a matter of deciding which makes the most sense. Any suggestions?

Looking to open a high interest savings account.





Emergency savings would be around $15k.

House down payment would be around $50k.





I won't be making future deposits to these accounts- so accounts that stipulate you must add additional funds every month won't work for me.





What do you all use and what would you recommend?





Also, is there any risk to these High Interest Accounts? I can't wrap my head around how they can offer up-to 10x the interest rate of other banks. Any info is appreciated.





Thank you.

This may come as a shock, but I never had a relationship or talked to a girl. Most people will tell me that I have a lot to learn about relationships.  Whatever. I'd like to remain ignorant and continue to believe girls don't shit, at least in my imagination.

I was the first in line and when the light turned green so I went through the light. Suddenly I'm being honked at by everyone and just missed getting t-boned. Still don't know how that truck missed me. But anyways, it was a fucking funeral. 



While paying a little more attention could have saved me a near death experience, I feel like the vehicles weren't marked and there was no police escort so I guess I'll be careful going through green lights from now on.

Who so you think are the real pest? Us or some animals? Ex. Rat so you think if we don't invade most of their natural environment and have their own habitat to live then they won't be bugging us on our life. We humans are the most intelligent species ever evolved on earth so it's up to us if we will preserve our own environment or keep exploiting it until all iur resources runs dry. You won't appreciate the worth of the well until it's dry.

I bought a crazy super deluxe pool noodle from costco for $18 when normally they are $50. My dog got a hold of it and ripped some off the nice coating on it and i dont know what i would need to repair it (stock is gone).



It would need to be waterproof flexible and non toxic  or sticky. Does anyone know a product that would work?

Think about it like Fallout Vegas but with millions of zombies wandering.  Think about Z Nation with the giant waves of zombies that come through.   Trying to keep settlements and towns stocked, provisioned, and well defended.  Trying to get gas means protecting the pumping stations and wells all over.  Rival factions etc. 



It could be the most epic game of all time.

Hi, sorry for the off topic, but you may know my question. I use to read some hours a day, and always used a daylight incandescent lamp (about 3100 k). But know in my country incandescent lights are forbidden, I tried with halogen, cfl, led... But my eyes hurt... What light do you use? If you could help me I would be very grateful.

A hand moved

And 

she spoke:

So, I have the entire run of the Simpsons available to me. I have really never seen it, except for small clips, and I really want to watch it at its best. What seasons should I start with? And how many should I watch?

Some background;

I'm a 19 year old college student and I'm trying to decide how to get my credit established. I'm a full time student in my second year and I make about $400 a month just working part time for my university. In the summer months I work at home making about $500-$600 a month but this year it should be more.



I'm thinking of getting a student card, possibly discover, as it has 0% APR for the first six months. I planned on trying to get this card in December so I could buy next semesters books and other items with it and then take advantage of the 0% APR to pay off my balance in the six months.



So my big question is is it better when establishing credit to pay my balance each month off in full, or is it better to make regular payments carrying a balance for the first couple of months? 



I'd like to think I'm a pretty knowledgeable young adult, but I'm unsure how to go about this. Any answers for this question would be greatly appreciated and any tips you have on how to build credit for a young college student would be great!

I can't remember it's name or artist for the life of me, but it's a huge painting, not as chaotic as a Pollock, and not as ordered as Mondrian. It has a huge red shape taking up most of the top right.

The starwars prequels are often heavily criticisized by fans as being horrible. To me at least, i think the story that they were going for seems to be actually more interesting than the originals starwars. It has politics,conspiracies, moral grays, love,betrayal. All of the characters seems to have the potential to be compelling, the doubtful jedi protagonist. A ruler in love with the potential villain of the story. The best friend mentor that loves the villain like a brother but is forced to kill him. The dark lord who acts like a puppet lord, weaving his plans in the most practical manner, playing both sides so he can win in many ways. The characters has serious potential.



Do you think it would be worth it to reboot the prequels, If yes, in what way will we do it?

On a long enough timeline machine intelligence will greatly surpass humans at everything. 



But what about the next decade or so, what do you think machine intelligence will be like in the 2020s and how will it differ from today? 



I think one thing that people don't realize is machine intelligence in the 2020s will make sexual abuse or any other kind of abuse almost impossible to get away with. I predict in the 2020s that cameras will be able to read our emotions and body language better than they do now. So if someone suddenly shows up and is giving off a large number of body language or emotional signals that something really bad happened, the camera will realize that and inform the right people. As a result, it'll be harder to get away with abuse. 



On that note, I think mental illness undiagnosis will become more rare for the same reason. Cameras will be able to distinguish small changes in our behavior, emotions, writings and body language that could signify the start of a mental illness. 



Right now, machine intelligence in the form of google greatly enhances our cognitive capacities. I think machine intelligence will do the same for our social and emotional skills in the 2020s. 



Other than that, I don't think strong AI will exist in 2020. Narrow AI will be better at more things. I think they will surpass humans at all video games (as opposed to the current crop of AI which can only beat humans at 3rd generation video game consoles). 



I think we will start seeing the benefits of devices like Watson in medicine and other fields. 



Self driving cars will be reasonably common. Not everywhere, but people will see them daily.

Hi PF! 

This has been a personal demon for me for the past two or three months. My SO lived and grew up in CT, before his mom moved closer to family. He has always wanted to move back, and I have always wanted to live out of state. This last month I suggested we move there. He would go out first because he has family to stay with. His Dad also has a small side business flipping houses and offered to employee him while out there. 



I would stay in UT while he got settled, made sure the work with his Dad would be stable, ect. Great plan right? The only issue is that this LDR is killing me. I can't take it any more and it has only been two weeks since he left. Long and short of it I planned to move out in December; I want to move out sooner. 



So here is my questions PF I have about $5000~ in savings. I am thinking it would be easier to find a job, apartment, ect. If I am out there but I am scared my savings won't be enough before I find work again. I have look to get another job while in UT but can't seem to get past the location. The other side of it is that my SO's job with his Dad looks like it would be more of a side job where he is paid under the table. It's enough that he should be paying a 1099 (taxform) but he is having issue getting housing because he doesn't have any paysubs or a contact of employment. He's looking for another job now. 



I know the smartest move would be to wait until he has another job or I have an offer from a CT company. However I tend to be a go where the wind takes me kind of person. I just don't want to end up homeless in a city I've never been to. 



TL;DR Would $5000 cover the cost of a move from UT to CT with no job lined up? Only basics being taken via car (clothes, family photos, ect?).

Considering we are 6 days out from Skyrim remaster, there might be some people out there who have never gotten the chance to experience mods for Skyrim... Whether it be for them being console only out of choice or not having a good enough computer (myself being of both the former and the latter). So, for the people who have experienced mods, what mops would yall suggest for those who will be experiencing mods for the first time on consoles?

I was once a successful business man, having built a company up from a stall at the market to a huge global conglomerate. When I sold my shares in the business to 'retire' my lawyer could afford to buy his own mega yacht.



I was so rich, that nothing was beyond my reach, I even had tourist tickets booked to go to the moon. My family and I had settled into a warm fugue that came with having bank balances resembling international telephone numbers. That was only the LIQUID assets.



I was set for life, my wife enjoyed anything she wanted, when she wanted and my three children have had the best education and healthcare available in the world.



My world felt safe, secure and incredibly comfortable, I spent my time flitting around the globe on my private jet, rarely spending more than a week in one place. My wife on the other hand, preferred to stay at our place in London, England, where the kids lived and worked.



This was not to last.



My world began to fall apart on a calm bright day at my beach villa in Bora Bora, I had been feeling a little off colour and had flown my private physician to the islands to see me.



He had instructed me to attend hospital in LA for some scans, and the way he told me, and that he would personally attend throughout my stay there put up the first red flag I have had to worry about in years.



I spent two weeks in the hospital room in LA, being prodded and poked, drained of blood and examined multiple times a day. After the first day I was told that I had cancer. Pancreatic cancer at that, which has a very high mortality rate, however I was in the best possible place to do everything they could to help me.



Nothing worked, my health began to deteriorate at an astonishing rate. They tried the best chemo, the most talented radiographers, the most experimental techniques, and nothing... It did not even slow the spread. There was nothing anyone could do for me on the 13th of July 2012 I was told I had 2 months to live and there was nothing anyone could do. No amount of money, no amount of influence and no amount of power could make the slightest impact on the creeping, rotting death that began to spread through my body.



I decided that I needed to see to my family before I got any worse, so made arrangements to fly home that evening. I packed my bags and had a service girl run me a bath.



I sank into the bath, my mind turning over all the things I had wanted to do but wasted my time doing things for the sake of being able to do them. I cried a few tears over the realizations that I would not see my children married or my first grandchild.



I cried and cried, self-pity was in full control. I lay back in the bath and tried to stop thinking, just trying for a bit of relaxation. I had closed my eyes for barely a second and when I opened them the room was dark.



A hooded dark figure sat by the bath. I swear I almost screamed...



"Who are you? How did you get in here?" I tried to grab the cord that would have called security without the figure noticing.



"I have an offer, I can cure you"



I don't know if the figure actually spoke or the words just formed in my head... I could not see inside that hood. My memory of him if vague at best, almost non-existent, I remember the offer, the contract and the consequences as clear as if they happened yesterday, but the figure with whom I spent a good few hours around in his presence, was little more than a blurry shadow, a blurry hooded shadow. His voice was deep and throaty, rough and raspy sounding like he had a forty a day habit.



Can you count the red flags? I heard the chance of a cure, and I regret it to this day that this overruled my conscious and unconscious warning systems... greedy self-preservation ruled.



"What? Cure? How?" was about all I could think, my head filled with a huge cloud of relief, hope.



"A pill and a procedure, within a week you will be cured and will never have to worry about illness or death ever again"



I should have paid attention to his words, read between the lines, considered the meaning...



"Is that all? What do I have to do for it?" I was not thinking...



"This will cost you everything you have, but in return will get the cure you wish for"



At this I did pause, but in my current mood this seemed like a bargain. I should have listened, thought or stopped, anything.



"Where do I sign?" What was wrong with me? I was trading everything I had to someone I had not even been in the room with for more than 5 minutes.



"The contract is by the sink, leave it there when you have read and signed it. Once you have put your signature on that paper, you have until you leave this room to change your mind"



Why would I change my mind I thought...? WHY WOULD I CHANGE MY MIND?????? Oh maybe because signing away everything I had to a creepy ass guy who appeared next to me in the blooming bath IN A LOCKED BATHROOM.. Might not be the action of a sane man.



"If you sign the contract, we will meet you in London to start the proceedings. If you change your mind and destroy the contract or do not sign, you will never meet me again. This is your one and only offer"



And with that, the lights came on, I was blinded for a second, my eyes having been accustomed to the dark, and he was gone.



I climbed out of the bath, astounded, I looked around the room and there wasn't even a chair for him to sit on... but there was, a manila envelope next to the sink, and a pen that looked grander than anything I own (and I own the world’s most expensive pens).



I will never ever forgive myself for the actions I took and the selfish act I then did. I signed the damn contract, I did not even turn over the first page. I signed it there and then, did a quick check for alternate signatures but the front page clearly read sign once here to agree to the terms and conditions and the deal will be binding.



I pushed the contract back into the envelope, and for the first time stopped to think a little...



"Oh well, if it doesn’t work then I can just not pay" I thought and placed the manila envelope back down next to the sink. I saw the clock and realised that I had just lost 2 hours and my jet was due to leave in an hour.



I rushed through to the next room, dressed and left the hospital not even looking back, thinking of anything else other than getting to London.



I was stupid, I was reckless, and I acted without thought... I should have read the terms and conditions.



I arrived in London at midnight, my limousine was waiting to take me back to my house as arranged. I expected to see my wife waiting for me, but even though I had tried phoning her when I got off the Jet, I could not get an answer. I expected the house to be lit up, but it was dark and quiet, I crunched up the driveway after sending my driver home and tried to be quiet. My wife must be asleep so I don’t want to disturb her.



I got to the door pulled my keys out my pocket, and tried the lock. It did not work. Before I could think any more of this a voice came from behind me that put chills down my spine. I recognised it immediately, but how did he get here so quick... I had been as fast as I could possibly go... I did not linger on this thought, I do not know why.



"Congratulations sir, if you would come with me to start the procedure"



"But my keys... what’s going... how did you... My wife...”



"Do not worry sir, you will get to see all your family very soon"



I stumbled to his limousine, which was as black as I have ever seen, as black as night. He held the door open with one arm and guided me in with the other.



We drove for a short time, I noticed that we were heading to the rougher part of the area, and we pulled up close behind an on ramp to the M25. There was a large group of homeless people lying in sleeping bags around a burning drum.



We stepped out the car, and looked over them for a second.



"What are we doing here?" I asked



"Picking your Vessel sir, I thought one of these people would be most suitable"



My vessel? For the first time, my heart starting sinking about not reading the contract properly. But should I let on? Best not to I suppose.



I nodded in what I hoped was a determined manner, and began to pace around the group, I could not help to think it was like walking around a sales room for cars or watches. I resisted the urge to kick them as if kicking the tyres on cars.



"This one" I settled on a scruffy mound that looked slightly cleaner than the rest.



What happened then I do not know. Blackness enveloped me and nothing else resides in my memory of that night.



I awoke, in a very comfortable four post bed, in a very old fashioned room with the walls covered in paintings of people I did not recognize, but seemed very very old. The room was warm and there were no signs of my clothes, just a large fluffy towelling robe on the bottom of the bed.



Pulling this on, I opened the only door I could see and peeked out. The next room was similarly decorated, old fashioned, regal, paintings... there seemed to be another door at the far end and one on the opposite wall, but the room was just empty.



As I was looking out, the door at the end of the room opened and an unfamiliar face poked out. Before either of us could say anything the voice came from a speaker somewhere and the door on the opposite wall opened.



"Please both of you enter the door opposite, and open the packages with your name on"



I was first in the room, the other man seemed drowsy almost zombie like as he walked in wordlessly behind me. Into a small room, that had lino on the floor and a drain, it had one chair with a package with a name on it that was unfamiliar to me (must have been the other man) and a small shelf with another parcel with my name on.



The door slammed shut tight behind us as we opened our packages. I almost dropped the letter that was in my package, grabbed it and looked at the other contents, it was a hacksaw. I turned to the letter.



Mr X,

For Mr Y to be your vessel, you must cut up his body in exactly 6 pieces. Please proceed to do so as fast as you can, we have but 24 hours to complete the procedure.





WTF... seriously WTF... I have to cut up his body? How? He is still behind me... wait... I spun around just in time to see the man looking at me with a knife in his hand. I drew my arms forward protectively hoping beyond hope that he misses and I get a chance to fight back. And watch with horrified eyes as he raises the knife to HIS OWN throat and damn near slices his bloody head off... he cuts almost all the way through his neck, blood spurts everywhere all over my face, all over the walls, my towelling robe becomes sodden with dark red blood.



His body slumps to the floor, and I sicken myself to say that I felt relief. I was relieved that I did not have to kill him myself...



I could not move for a while, but the voice came and reminded me.



"Please complete this task as soon as possible, you will need all the time you can get later in the procedure"



I thought, what the hell, and bent down to start my grizzly task. I sawed off his arms, then his legs, and finally his head. There 6 parts.



A door clicked open, not the one we entered from, but one behind the chair in the small room.



"Please enter, and take the chair with you" The voice rang out.



I grab the chair and walk into the next room it was pitch black, the light from the small room allowed me to see that it was larger than the small room, but smaller than the larger room that we started in. there was the shadow of a table in front of me, with a few shadowy objects that I couldn’t quite make out. I placed my chair at the table and sat down.



The lights came on as soon as I was seated. On the table I saw a bucket full of a clear liquid, a pair of tongs and large rubber gloves.



"Take his head and put it in the bucket" The voice instructed.



I was covered in blood, bits of flesh were stuck in my finger nails and I swear in my hair... Was I being guided by some malevolent beast, I felt and remember being in full control, but how I did these incredibly grizzly and despicable things I cannot say.

I grabbed the head from the other room, took it to the bucket and dipped it in slightly... It fizzed and I could see the flesh melting, the liquid picking up a red tinge.



I paused, grabbed the gloves, put them on, transferred the head to the tongs and dipped it all the way in. It was like dropping alka seltzer in water... bubbles threatened to overflow the bucket and splash my arms and body.



In about 5 minutes, just as my arm was getting tired, the fizzing died down. I looked into the bucket and not seeing through the thick red liquid that it had turned into, I drew the head out a little... All the flesh had been removed and the stark whiteness of the bone surprised me. I instantly developed a healthy respect for the contents of that bucket...



"Please take the skull, remove the last of the spine and jaw bone and hollow out the cranium" The voice instructed.



I spot a chisel lying by the bucket and complete the task. Understanding now what he meant by Vessel. I held in my hand the skull of a man that I picked at random from the street only a few hours ago... Why do I not remember being horrified, I certainly am now.



"Please proceed into the next room"



Still holding my macabre coffee mug, I get up and head through a previously unnoticed door on the near wall. This room was very much like the second room, where the man had killed himself and I performed what I thought would be the worst act of my life.



In this room there was a mirror and, hanging from the ceiling, a handle, nothing else. The door clicked shut behind me and I waited looking at the bloody mess I had become in the mirror, was there something in my eye, a little darkening of the whites of my eyes, in fact they look decidedly grey.



As I looked at myself in the mirror, it began to slide up revealing another room behind. I could see four dim shapes in the darkness.



"The handle above you needs to be pulled on 6 times but it will put you through the worst experience of your life. I recommend you do this as fast as possible since the next step takes even the hardest people a significant time to complete"



To hell with it I thought and I grabbed the handle and gave it 6 long pulls in very quick succession. This set the following into motion.



With the first pull, the lights in the other room came on 



With the second pull, the hoods were removed from the 4 people sat in bathtubs 



With the third pull, hammers began to beat the people sat in the bathtubs 



With the fourth pull spinning blades were lowered into the bathtubs, spraying blood everywhere 



With the fifth pull blood began to come out of sprinklers hidden in the ceiling in the room I was in 



With the sixth pull the trickle of blood became a torrent beginning to slowly fill up the room I was in



I turned and looked into the room with horror as I see things act out in rapid succession... the faces, they were familiar... the hair, I need not tell you my life ended in that room. I stood and watched everything I had in the world being destroyed by my own actions and being bathing in their lifeblood.



I threw up, a lot, I voided myself from my mouth, my arse, my cock, I fell over, the gory mess was ankle deep now, and my robe fell off covered in the worst of human fluids.



I cried as the rain of blood slowed down, and I hear a click as a drain in the floor must have opened since the blood level began to drop... I tried to recover the blood in my hands, tried to keep some part of any one member of my family... Tried to hug it to my chest.



"Please move into the next room for the final part of the procedure"



"What the hell have you made me do?!!" I screamed



"You have given everything for your cure, as you signed in the contract"



"But... but... "



"It was all clearly explained in the terms and conditions"



I sat in my shrinking pool of blood for a minute, despising myself, regretting every decision that led me to this place, coming to a great big realisation that I have done the worst possible thing to get what I wanted, more life... I now have no life to return to.



The door opens in front of me back to the first room with the three doors, and this time there is a large trough in the middle filled with red gloop... yes I could see what it was... I could SMELL what it was everything smelled that way now... but this STANK!



"You must now drink 6 cups of the remains of your victims, using your Vessel"



I passed out.



I awoke to a clock ticking, it was counting down just past 3 hours...



"Welcome back sir, I have provided you with the time you have remaining... If you do not finish the last Vessel full of your victims by the end of this time it will have all been for naught"



I grimace, I had given up hoping it was a dream about 10 seconds after watching the first hammer hitting my wife directly in the face, then watching hammers punching into the skulls of my beautiful children.



"Fuck you, Fuck all of this" I screamed and broke down crying... I dragged my gory naked body, having left the shit, piss and blood soaked robe in the other room, over to the trough and dipped the 'Vessel' in deep.



I immediately felt bile rising in my throat, it was still warm... and there were large lumps...



I vomited again, the last of the contents of my body thrown over the plush carpet. I could then only retch... as I tried to fill the cup... I found I had to hold it a bit like a bowling ball with my fingers plugging the eye sockets to allow me the get enough in the vessel to actually lift to my lips...



I couldn’t do it... I threw the cup away against the wall showering the faces in the painting with gory graffiti.



"You are responsible for the deaths of 5 people tonight, either you take 6 cups of your victims, or you become the 6th victim"



I stopped retching long enough to walk over to the wall and retrieve the skull. I dipped it deep into the trough and rushed it up to my mouth to take a huge swig... I spat it out immediately... again all over the wall...



I looked at the clock and found but 1 hour remaining... time must tick by differently in that place. Damn, I had to do this.



I refilled the skull and managing not to spit it out this time, I swallowed mouthful after mouthful of the macabre soup.



"6 Cups of your victims blood, 6 strokes to sacrifice your life, 6 gifts to the lord of death"



I had given up counting, just trying to do it as quick as possible, before I threw up again. The voice suddenly announced the completion of the task and I fell to the floor retching, but nothing came out... the gore I had eaten did not fill my stomach.



"I hereby grant your life eternal, yours is perpetuity"



What this meant I did not know, I should have known, it was in the terms and conditions.



I have never since been ill, not even a cold, I feel perfectly healthy all the time. I got what I wanted huh?



I wander the streets of London, earning what I can but any money I earn disappears when I sleep, any food I eat turns to ash in my mouth. I literally have nothing and can never again own anything. People forget me quickly, even if I spend a long time with them, it seems like overnight I am erased from their memory, I am no longer able to maintain friends or ever have a family again.



This is no life but I am doomed to live it forever.



I beg of you all, please, before you sign anything, read the terms and conditions in detail, or you could end up losing everything and gaining nothing.

Does anyone know the best high yield checking and savings options for online banks? I'm not really interested in the ones that require 10 transactions a month to get 2-5%, but the ones where I can get maybe .5% or more in checking and 1% or more in savings without having to make any effort except maybe direct deposit.



Currently I use ally, but they don't have EMV on their debit cards and still over a year after the liability switch, have made no effort to add this feature. They also only do 0.10% on checking now, which feels kind of low, and limited ATM reimbursements to $10 a month.



I use Schwab for a no FTF debit card that refunds ATM fees, but they don't offer good interest rates to justify parking my money there.



So far the only other option I'm seeing is Alliant Credit Union which is basically like Ally, and but 0.65% on checking, they have EMV on their debit cards, they refund $20 a month for ATM's instead of $10, and they seem to also support multiple savings accounts for the envelope style system of saving that I like.



So my question is, compared to Ally and Alliant, are there any other better alternatives, or are those 2 of the best no effort online banking accounts out there?

First things first, I **love** reading. As a kid I would eat books up constantly. If I had a spare break after doing something I would read a book. If I went to the bathroom, the book went to the bathroom. If I was eating, I was reading. I mean, I guess not constantly; I did other things too, like video games or playing outside, but nothing really hooked me quite like em.



So, the past few years I've been doing jack shit for reading. In fact, I've probably only read one book in this entire span of time (when before I would sometimes read one a day), and that was Less Than Zero, because I could kind of empathize with that feeling of floating through existence. And the way it's written is just perfect for a dead brain. I've just been seemingly incapable of starting a book, because it feels I've been operating at half capacity, and I wouldn't get the full thrill of the ocean with such shite tattered rags for sails.



However...now that I'm starting to feel the call once more, it's finally dawning on me how much fucking time I've wasted doing unbelievably pointless and unfulfilling shit that could've been better spent reading and ffrrrrdfgkln I'm going to be regretting this for the rest of my life, aren't I?

Both obviously directed by JJ Abrams. Both have the highest box office of their respective franchises. Both have high Rotten Tomato scores. Both have been criticized for ripping off plot elements/scenes of previous installments. It's interesting to note during the press tour for The Force Awakens JJ Abrams noted how he felt he dropped the ball a little with Star Trek into Darkness yet some of the same criticisms have now been applied to The Force Awakens.

I would figure a non-EQ'd recording would just sound...live. I just don't understand why we have to cut out frequencies that are naturally contained within an instruments' timbre in order to make it sound right, especially when two acoustic guitars, two singers, and someone on a djembe sounds perfectly mixed when it's happening right in front of you. Are we doing a form of self-mixing in live, acoustic settings? And/or is there something about multi-track recording that adds something that needs to be mixed out?

I currently contribute 6% of my paycheck pre-tax towards my 401(k) because my employer will match up to the 6%, dont want to lose any free money there. I am debating between maxing out my 401(k) this year, $18,000 contributed, knowing that i can borrow against my 401(k) for down payment of my first primary residence, OR just continuing my 6% and savings all of the extra cash in my savings account.



This might be trickier and have all sorts of ifs/buts involved, but thought i would throw out a few of my thinking points as to why i am debating this.



1) I am a single male with no dependents on taxes and by maxing out my 401(k) i would save some money on the federal taxes i have to pay this year. Since my 401(k) is pre-tax i would be using pre-tax money for the down payment and pre-tax money to re-pay myself as well. Ultimately this plan seems like it might be my tax evasion plan, a co-worker put the bug in my ear on this.



2) continue just the 6% and take everything else and save save save to just do it all with cash.



Regardless i will have the amount saved i need for my down payment by the time i plan on buying, just wondering if there is a real tax/long term advantage to messing with the 401(k) plan.

There are a lot of reports about this on the steam forum and r/civ, but I have not seen any articles about it yet.



Here is what it looks like: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/255969629397626467/1EA3E84042D918C08703DDF14C06AEA5F1D21283/



Here is an image grab from the manual: http://i.imgur.com/74CXFce.png



There has been no official statement yet. I thought it best to warn people.

were the same one from Harry Potter.  I used to love Clash of the Titans, the original 80s version not the reboot.  I also knew Maggie Smith had appeared in other movies before Harry Potter including one where she worked on film with Daniel Radcliffe before Harry Potter. But I never realized that she was also in Clash of the Titan.



I was just watching it and it kept nagging me that a certain goddess seemed familiar so I had to hit IMDB to see who she was. Maggie Smith.



I am sure I missed a few other actor connections between older films and newer films. What about you guys?

**About me:**



*Personal*



* 24yo

* 4 years married

* 2 kids (3yo & 1.5yo)

* Expecting 1 more at the end of January



*Employment*



I'm a full time, *remote* employee in the web/tech industry; I've been working in this industry since I became an adult. I started at entry level and now hold a Senior title; tenure with my current employer is approaching 2 years. My current employer (an agency) is well known/respected, large for our niche, and is generally a great place to work.

However, I've been growing tired of agency life for some time, and have recently started looking elsewhere for a non-agency workplace.



*Housing*



I live on the east coast in a rural area.

Almost exactly a year ago, my wife and I purchased our first home via a ~$225k FHA loan. We had a number of reasons to buy a home where we are; one by one–those reasons have ceased to be valid (not super important to detail why, but suffice it to say that we're not thrilled with our choice).



*Financial*



I make close to six figures. 6% goes to 401k; rest goes to mortgage, health insurance, bills, spending money (we're not tight, but not lavish by any means), and then the rest in savings (typically $300-$400 a month).



*My current situation/reason for posting:**



I got a random email from a recruiter at a great company in San Francisco; the email was personalized (not the usual spammy stuff). The company is looking to expand their engineering department, and reached out to me about a lead role, helping to grow/shape/define that team. **The role would be an onsite position.**



My dilemma: I'm not happy where I am geographically, in my employment, and in my status as a remote employee. I could *certainly* continue in my current state and live a comfortable life, but I'm not convinced my current situation is one that's tenable long-term.



Given that I am only1 year into a 30 year mortgage, make good money, and am financially comfortable, **am I a fool for seriously considering this change?** Giving it all up, packing up, and moving to San Francisco in pursuit of a job that excites me, and a city that has exponentially more opportunity for someone like me?

It was yesterday, I'm still recovering.



I work at a coffee bar. Usually I'm there around 7 am, and we get to deal with the crazies real early. Some meth heads, party boys, drunks, homeless, etc. It was a normal day.



Except I was extremely hungover. That one kind where you can barely feel where you head is, let alone talk to people or provide a service.



After 10 mins of barely surviving behind the counter, I asked the other guy working with me to take a break and have a smoke. He's cool with it, like always, and I head out to the back with my cup of coffee.



I sit on the stairs, in the back of the joint. One homeless dude comes by asking for change, and I just keep on puffing my cigarette, kinda looking away. He wanders off in silence..



I turn back to my cup of coffee which this dude obviously swapped. The stink and texture of this liquid shit hitting my lips. I am in shock.



He enjoyed some coffee, I tasted some obvious sort of shit.

I wonder if  hundreds of years from now people would celebrate Kal-El day and children would hear stories about how Superman saved the planet from countless threats like Doomsday and Darkseid, or how the Guardians created the Green Lantern Corps to fight evil throughout the galaxy just the way we hear stories of how Durga defeated the evil Maisasur or how Moses split the Red Sea in half to make a passage for his people or how an omnipotent, onmniscient,  omnipresent entity called god created the universe in 7 days. Wouldn't it be cool if the new gods replaced the present god/s?

Hey! I've been curious about eating a real American Mac n cheese. I found a recipe that tasted soooooo soooooo bad, so I won't be using that ever again. I was supposed to use some mint leaf crap, so I'm pretty sure that isn't a real Mac n cheese recipe.





Now I'm curious about the Mac n cheese the common American eats. How do you make it? What do you eat to the Macs? I fried bacon to mine and it ended up being the only thing I ate from that dish I made.

Hello PF!



I read the rules and FAQ (sorry if I missed anything), and made a throwaway since some people know me.



Last year I made $55,000 and saved $11,000 in my 401k and $5,500 in my Roth IRA.



I recently got a new job with a small company and now make $72,000. I want to max out my 401k and Roth IRA in 2017.



Now I've heard that my company limits our contributions to 15% of our salary, which means I can only contribute $10,800. I hate the idea that I got a 30% salary increase but can now invest LESS than before. (If you're thinking I should have found this out sooner: this is the first year the company offers a 401k).



I read about "highly compensated employees" and 401k limits, but I don't get it. Why would my employer limit me, a non-HCE, to invest less than the IRS limit? HCE's will still max out their 401ks by investing 15%, so those of us making <$120,000 are the ones who are effected!



What should I do? Get a second job, change jobs, open a brokerage account? I hate the feeling of missing opportunity for compounding while I'm under 30, but this is my dream job. Has anyone been in this position?

Southseattle77  

"What'd you say?!"



AwesomeBitchGF  

"'Well, sir. There happens to be multiple football games on today. I'm not a mind reader. And if I was, I'm sure I would find a blank slate up there. Fuck off, thank you very much.'"



"The cashier was dying."



I couldn't be more proud!!

The IRS withholding calculator says we'll pay less tax by filing two separate "Single" status returns than filing one "Married Filing Jointly" return. I don't mean "Married Filing Singly". I mean two returns with the "Single" status.



Is it legal to be married and file two separate returns with the "Single" status?

A very attractive young female speech pathologist was presented with three young Irishmen, all of whom stuttered. She spent many long hours working with them both individually and as a group. She tried everything in the book.  Finally, totally perplexed by their lack of progress she called them all together one day.  

"Paddy, Mick, Sean. I am at my wits end. I am willing to make you this bargain. If any of you, ANY of you can say the name of the town where he was born without stuttering then I will make love to you immediately. OK?"  

She was greeted with three wide smiles and three heads nodding furiously.  

"Paddy?"  

"Tip-tip-t-t-t-t-iperary, damn!"  

"Sorry Paddy. Mick?"  

"Dub-dub-dub-dublin, damn!"  

"Nice try Mick. Come on Sean your go."  

"London"  

A look of astonishment came over her face. She had made the bargain not expecting any of them to be able to say one word without stuttering.   

"OK Sean. Off we go. We will be back soon guys. Take a seat"  

After a while the two return from their love-making.  

"Well Sean? You were very quiet in there. Do you have anything to say at all?"  

"d-d-d-derry"

Up to to now my parents have been doing my taxes for me, So this would be the first time doing it alone. Also this year I started working freelance gigs and started bringing in an income of roughly 84k a year. 



What would be the most affordable way to pay taxes? Should I get a business license and do taxes through the business, make myself an employee and then file taxes on myself separately? Or should I just file all the cash and checks in my name?



I have no idea how taxes work and kinda scared now that I have to file alone, I feel like if I forget to file a 1 check I'm gonna get thrown in jail for tax evasion or something.

BF Bad Company 2 was the first fps I ever played and spent a crazy amount of time playing. I haven't owned a Battlefield since then (due to studying) but I recently bought a playstation 4 and I've been thinking of getting BF1. My question is, is it worth it? How has the Battlefield franchise aged? Like wine or like a sliced avocado stored in the fridge?

Predator. Aliens. Terminator. They Live. The Hitcher. Assault On Precinct 13. Evil Dead 2.



What was it about the 80s that led to all these action flicks with great horror elements, and horror flicks with great action scenes? You'd think the two genres would go together like peanut butter and chocolate but the only movies I can think of off the top of my head that aren't deliberate retro throwbacks (like The Guest and Death Proof) would probably be Dog Soldiers, the first Resident Evil flick, World War Z, and possibly The Purge.



What led to this renaissance? Aside from a general aversion to risk-taking in today's Hollywood, is there any reason why we haven't seen much of a return to this style?

So this was a few years back with my (now) wife (then girlfriend). So we were going to just hang out and make out maybe. It was the middle of the night in a rural town in a semi hidden part of the park. So we thought we would be pretty good.

We make out a little in my truck and she gets out walks around opens my door and pulls my man meat out. And gets down on her knees and gets to work. Its going great and I see 4 cop cars pull up and surround us. She stands up and I try to uncomfortably stuff my erection back into my pants. 

I was really confused what was going on and I realized there was a gun show the next day. So the keep the guns locked up all night and they saw a truck parked off in the corner of the park and thought we were staking the place out. 

Anyways they noticed the dirt on her knees and my obvious erection. The cops put me in cuffs to scare me, typical small town johnny law dog stuff. But eventually one of them (who thought the whole thing was funny) said, "Listen, I know she was polishing your rocket. I get it. But stay at home if you're gonna do that." He took my cuffs off and said "now get out of my park." And believe me we did. So we went to sonic to get some dinner lol.



TLDR; My gf was giving me head in the city park at night and the cops pulled up put me in cuff but then let us go.

I'm taking a painting class this semester and my professor is very much into the abstract-ish style of painting - lots of shapes, random colors and scribbles, photographs with circles painted over people's heads, really angry looking slashes of paint, etc. Here are a few examples that I remember from class [1](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/8e/a9/98/8ea998552cd40d164efb1bc53fb68127.jpg) [2](http://www.welcomestranger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot_2014-01-06-07-31-17-1.png) [3](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_o68Jq4UhWbs/Sh1BEg6ouLI/AAAAAAAADd4/GsY68h6mwrs/s400/arss_john_baldessari_08_h.jpg)



The issue is that... I don't think I really understand abstract art. When I look at it, I think it's interesting and all, but I don't feel impressed or awed by it like I do other paintings. However, I really need a good grade in this class! As trivial as this may sound to some people, I can't afford to have this impact my gpa (I'm applying to med school next year). 



So my questions are - can anybody help me understand what's so great about abstract art? How do you create abstract art? Can you "plan" your abstract art, or does it have to be more spontaneous? I like to work mainly with watercolor, and I'm also studying abroad so I don't want to go and buy oil/acrylic tools - so is it possible to create good abstract art with watercolor, given that I feel like it requires a little more planning? 



Also, I'd love to discuss this topic of having somebody tell you what kind of art to make. I feel like maybe students need to be told, in order to expand their horizons or whatever? but at the same time, this sucks so much and all I want to do is paint what I like without worrying about my grades! I think it's very anti-art to try to force yourself to paint things you don't want to paint.

I saw the video the same as you guys yesterday day and I have to say I'm intrigued. I've owned many Nintendo handhelds over the years starting with the og gameboy. That said I've never owned a Nintendo home console and their exclusives besides Zelda haven't held the same charm and nostalgia that they have for others. I get on "the internet" after seeing the switch excited to see what other people think and am both surprised and a bit confused as to the amount of people excited to play third party games on the go like remastered skyrim(xbox360 skyrim I can see) and red dead 2. Everyone seems to expect this to be on par with the PS4 and Xbox with a minor deficit in power. I'm not sure we all watched the same video because what I saw was a small compact tablet. Does your iPad run skyrim and call of duty... no? Then don't expect this thing to. That said I expect this to be the most powerful gaming tablet available and tablets continue to amaze me with how fast they are catching up to consoles but I feel like they will always be a step behind simply due to size. One thing with gaming on tablets that I hate is touch controls and this device thankfully has controller support built in and I love that I have the option to play the games on my tv since most of my handheld gaming is at home on the couch anyway. Also I feel like I'm reading comments from the Wii U days all over again with people hopeful that third parties will flock to Nintendo because "this time" it will be better. I know that Nintendo made the comment that this is a home console first and for most and honestly I think they shot themselves in the foot with that. I look at this as a successor to the 3ds which I felt like was a poor half step up from the ds and I feel excited I like everything I see. I just think people need to manage their expectations with this and take it for what it really is nintendos next handheld that will play Nintendo ass games and it's cool.

I am in a very tight pickle. I want (and have wanted) to fly a 3'x5'  flag in front of our house but the 2 standard methods are not allowed (rental).  

  

I can't dig a hole in the lawn to bury a pole or drill any holes in the eve's of the roofline to hang the flag, per requirements of the lease/owner.  

  

I am in need of creative ideas on how to be able to fly Old Glory without causing an issue with my lease agreement.   

  

A few ideas I've thought of are:  

5gal bucket w/ cement and guy wires to hold down pole.  

Fashion a clamp out of 2x6's and lag bolts to clamp onto the eave to give me something to bolt a pole to.   

Don't know about the practicality of either, but in my head they sound good.

1st question: [This website](http://mriquestions.com/how-does-b1-tip-m.html) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKp67IqQjH4) show that the angle of precession increases when you apply the RF pulse. However, [Section 5.00 of this website](http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/chem605/) shows that the cone of precession flips but the angle doesn't change. Could someone please explain what exactly is happening to the net magnetization vector?



2nd question: [This website](http://mriquestions.com/off-resonance.html) says that if the frequency of the RF pulse =/= Larmor frequency then it would precess around the Beff axis in the rotating frame. Does it mean that in the stationary frame it's precessing in 2 axes (the z axis and Beff axis) at the same time?



Thank you very much.

You came to see the play, to admire the actors, to follow the complex plot. And after the play is over - you write on Reddit: "Stage decorations were awesome!" 



I don't get it. 



Why are so many people putting so much value in the "world-building" in mainstream fantasy books? It is all well and interesting and one of the reasons to read fantasy, I suppose, but it is, mostly, trivial. Worlds are relatively easy to build, and fantasy writers usually do it the easy way. There are few exceptions. They are all about the world, it being main part of the books' charm: Michael Shea, Brandon Sanderson, any weird-fantasy authors like China Miéville (though "weird" is not "mainstream"). But praise "the world building" of Patrick Rothfuss? Or poor old Martin? Or Joe Abercrombie? Joe is too polite and generally cheerful to spit into any person's eyes, but after the world-building praise - I think he should, because if there is a fantasy writer who is not "about the world" - this is Joe.



There are two parts of world-building. Firstly, there is an idea. "Gods are dead, their ex-priests usurped their power". Or: "Ancient Evil, buried under the Antarctic ice, is awakening due to the global climate changes". Or: "The sun is green, and rainbows have only six colors in them". Ideas CAN be interesting. The problem is that the more you read - the less interesting they become. You begin to know all the tropes, which takes some of their appeal away. Some ideas can still catch your imagination. They are few in numbers... and they are most definitely not present in Martin's or Rothfusse's or Joe's writings.



Secondly, the execution. How good is author in describing his world? How relevant is it to the plot? And other very important... technicalities. This is what authors do, part of the literary skill, of being a good storyteller. Nothing to be praised independently, as a big "reason to read this book". When you discuss it in details? Yes. "Oh, the world building is amazing!!! My new favorite book!" No.



Sorry for being so very emotional about it. What do you think?

... On his first day of school his teacher asks, "What is your name?"



"My name is Mohammed" the boy replies.



"You live in Ireland now, Your new name is Mike" says the teacher.



The boy smiles and has a good time in his classes.



After school the boy returns home and is greeted by his mother.



"How was your first day at school, Mohammed?" his mother asks.



"I live in Ireland now, my new name is Mike!" The boy replies.



His mother becomes infuriated, "Have you forgotten where you came from? Your heritage? You have disgraced your ancestors!"



and his mother beat him and when his father comes home from work he does the same.



The next day the boy returns to school and his teacher sees his fresh bruises.



"Mike! What happened?" asked the teacher.



The boy replies with a grimace "Well, shortly after becoming an Irishman I was jumped by two fucking Arabs!"

Hi /r/personalfinance!



I'm just about about to start a business with 4 other co-owners, splitting ownership evenly at 20% each. From my share I expect to take home close to $20-40K from the business in 2017 before taxes. I also have a full time job where I make $50K with benefits.



Are there any good books or other resources to help structure business taxes, business expenses, right offs, etc., and how all that intersects with my personal taxes? 



Also, I am fairly sure I should seek counsel from an accountant, but I don't really know where to start! I'm 24 and need help! Thanks :)

I personally believe that it should be possible to 100% complete a game for the first time without taking a single hit of damage. If you've read anything I've written on here before, you probably know that.



Now, this doesn't mean that I want games to be without challenge and that I want the game to be super easy. What I mean by this is, I would like to try and see if a game can be completed and challenging WITHOUT trial and error.



This is an example of trial and error. There are obstacles and harmful things in the game that you cannot possibly know or learn about until it's too late, and it has already hurt you. Not the player's fault.



Basically, this creates a punishment that wasn't really deserving. The game is punishing you for not knowing about it, despite the fact that the only way you could possibly know and learn about it is to have it punish you for such in the first place. In other words, punishment is unavoidable, making it less of a punishment and more of the game being a jerk to you.



I somewhat believe that the game should give you fair instructions and a proper method of teaching the player WITHOUT having the player taking damage from that. I don't believe players should learn that lava can kill them only by falling into it first.



The reason I believe that games shouldn't be made this way is, because it creates a more frustrating and unstable game the first time around. Sure, maybe the SECOND time around, you can play the game without taking a single hit of damage, but the first half, you're playing the game by running and testing each little piece of the game, and then using that for future runs.



So, what I'm trying to ask is, is it even possible to create a fun and challenging game without the need of trial and error?

I need some ideas for where to paint furniture. I cannot paint in the house/garage. Can I paint it outside? If so, how do I protect it from animals/bugs getting in the paint?



Project is one bare wood piece and one laminate piece both getting painted white. Oil base paint and polycrylic top coat. From what I read it could take up to a month to cure.



Any help is very much appreciated!

My boyfriend is fantastic. He is sweet and compassionate and smart and funny and hot as hell. 



But



Recently I made friends w a girl at work.  She has a lot in common w me and a lot in common w him as far as interests and hobbies.  Instantly I got a weird jealousy flare (I'm the jealous type) and imagined that if he ever met her he'd like her more than me and leave me.  



I'm autistic and I've had bad luck w men, and every relationship before this one was abusive and I got cheated on.



Anyways, I decide I'll be friends w her on the DL and not I produce them even if it's paranoid.



So a few weeks go by and she realizes who I'm dating and come to find out they went to high school together and guess what he had a crush on her, but she didn't like him back and had a thing for some other guy and eventually they drifted apart from being friends as she got wrapped up w her boyfriends bs etc etc.



OK, I feel vindicated in my jealousy but also she doesn't like him and it's cool.



Well, later on I mention something to him about her, like oh hey I found out this girl at my work used to go to school w you - and he flips out.



Yelling, swearing, calling her horrible names, saying she's a bad person, and orders me to never speak to her again.



We have a big fight over it bc he won't say why and I have a hard enough time making friends, and I refuse.  I tell him unless he gives me a reason I'm staying friends w her.



He won't give a reason.



So I ask him if it's bc she wouldn't date him and he flips out again. Saying she's fat and ugly and a whore and he would never want to date a disgusting etc etc etc.



Now, every time I get on my phone whether it's email or twitter or whatever, he's like "oh are you talking to HER again!?!"



And he even threatened to friend request the woman who helped a man roofie me if I didn't cut her off.  



He still won't give me a reason why, and when I push for one just says "you're my girlfriend you're supposed to hate who I hate and if you don't you're a bad girlfriend"



Help!!! This is super out of character for him! He never talks bad about anyone, including people who have stolen from him or use drugs, and he is always bending over backwards to be friendly to people.  I don't know what to think, because nothing matches up!

One candidate offered excellent references and experience and was well-dressed and well-spoken. The only catch was a disconcerting mannerism: the fellow couldn't seem to stop winking.



So the sales manager decided to be frank, "You've got all the qualifications for the job and I'd really like to hire you, but I'm afraid that facial tic of yours might put customers off".



"I'm glad you brought that up, sir," said the sales candidate, "because all I need to make that annoying wink go away is a couple of aspirin. See for yourself, I've got some on me". And he began emptying his pockets on the desk.



The prospective employer was startled to see dozens of packages of condoms piling up: ribbed ones, lubricated ones, multicolored ones, every variety imaginable.



"Aha", cried the young man happily, "here they are". He brandished two aspirin, swallowed them , and sure enough, the tic went away in less than a minute.



"So much for the wink," said the sales manager sternly, gesturing at the mountain of rubbers, "but what about all this stuff here? I don't want my company to be represented by some wild womanizer, after all".



"No fear. I'm a happily married man".



"So how can you account for the contents of your pockets"?



"It's simple, sir. Did you ever go into a drug store, winking like crazy, and ask for a packet of aspirins"?

Hesitation is the enemy. In any given action, it messes with our rhythm and flow. In social interaction, it makes us prey to dominance. It makes us seem less trustworthy, less assertive, and submissive.

Never anticipate failure. You have to push those thoughts out of your head as you focus. Our anticipation of failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, not for some mystical reason, but simply because the hesitation inhibits performance(in whatever context). And in more extended situations, we stop taking steps toward success when we've stopped to feel bad for ourselves.

The broaden and build theory of positive emotions also supports the notion that hesitation and fear prevent us from successful endeavors, from the smallest to the largest. The broaden and build theory states that positive emotions expand one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Negative emotions have the opposite effect. These effects aren't just general, but apply to specific physical tasks and mental agility especially.

Eliminating hesitation, and fostering a positive attitude only serves to decrease anxiety and increase performance. The effects of eliminating hesitation alone should create a feedback loop that improves your mood, which spills right back into the feedback loop.

Moral of the story, the power of positive thinking is real! More so, the power of negative thinking is greater!

My girlfriend recently bought this $90 tub of hair product to use after a shower. It's been about three weeks of her using it, and **it smells fucking putrid.** Rotting fruit and a stale fart could almost describe it. I've mentioned I didn't care for it but she said it takes time to get used to and her hair to get used to new product.. A few days ago, I couldn't take it anymore. So I emptied out the tub and filled it with mostly just water and a small amount of her regular hair conditioner. After a shower, I watched her massage the stuff in her hair and I felt happy knowing my home wouldn't smell like a trash dump anymore. 

"My hair has finally gotten used to it!! It works great now. I'll definitely have to buy some more of this."

Ninety fucking dollars for the scent of butthole.



**Tl;dr Girlfriend buys bad hair product, I fill it with water because I hate the smell and she ends up loving my secret concoction so much that she plans to spend MORE MONEY ON IT.**

A Woman was out golfing one day when she hit the ball into the woods.



She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap.



The frog said to her, "If you release me from this trap, I will grant you three wishes."



The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, "Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.



Whatever you wish for, your husband will get times ten!"



The woman said, "That's okay."



For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.



The frog warned ☝her, "You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will flock to".



The woman replied, "That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me."



So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world!



For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.



The frog said, "That will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times richer than you."



The woman said, "That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine."



So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!



The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, "I'd like a mild heart attack."



Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them.



Attention female readers : This is the end of the joke for you. Stop here and continue feeling good.



Male readers: Please scroll down.



The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his wife.



Moral of the story: Women think they're really smart.



Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy the show.



Note: If you are a woman and are still reading this; it only goes to show that women never listen.

The professor gets to the sexual anatomy system. He asks ' would someone like to come up to the blackboard and draw a penis for us?'  



The blond jumps up enthusiastically 'I will!' And proceeds to draw a huge boner.  



Exasperated, the professor says 'Will you please draw it the other way!'  



Confused, the blond replies 'What other way?'

I'm pretty sure this isn't the right sub but I don't see where best to post.



I'm looking for a film probably from the 90s about a guy who more or less trasforms into a very graphic power ranger. The whole film is very violent and very gory.



I think the main character who was charged could also rejuvenate his spikes and stuff.

The internet company I work for granted me 1000 stock options last year.  These vest after 100% 4 years (25 each)  or if the company goes public.  This year they are in talks to convince everyone to convert their options to phantom shares. I am being told that this is for my benefit because payout will be guaranteed on a schedule, whether or not there is an IPO.



Am I being misled?

I used to play this mech game, your mech was blue, and could switch between a walker mode and a flight mode. Most of the time, you were in an arctic area, and one of the weapon was a continuous beam on top of your mech. I don't exactly remember when i played it, but it was around 2000. Anything comes to mind ? I remember having a crapton of fun despite not knowing the controls, but now i shouldn't have any problems with them.

In The Truman Show, there is only a single occupant (Truman) who doesn't realize his reality is fake.  Everyone else is an actor. The entertainment comes from Truman's naive behaviour.



In Westworld, 99% of the occupants (droids) don't realize their reality is fake and the 1% (guests) are explorers. The entertainment comes from the guests' conscious behaviour.

My current job does a 4% match but you only get to keep the money after 3 years. I don't plan on being there for that long. Should I even both to put money in? I'm 26 and my wife is 23 with a household income of about $40,000. My wife and I save on our own. We take out 5% of each paycheck and put it manually into our savings account (an account that we don't touch for anything). 



If I won't be meeting the requirements to take the company contributions with me, should I just keep doing what I've been doing or start contributing towards it? We started saving about 3 years ago and are at about 15k in savings so far. I would like to increase that with employer contributions but I have to find a place I would like to stay at long term. Plus I like the security that if we ever REALLY need to money (emergency, etc) we can get it within a couple hours. At some point we'll have both. A small emergency fund (couple thousand bucks), a bigger retirement savings account, and a 401k with an employer.



Thanks for reading.

One of the primitive reflexes of a baby is to simply imitate what they see others doing , which is how they learn to control their own body (using the person in front of them as a "mirror").

But how does it work in the baby's brain? How can he imitate things by using connections in his brain that he never used before , and how does he even know where they are?



(Medical student here btw , so don't hesitate to give more details if you find it useful)

It's only a matter of time right? It seems the internet loves ripping on millennials (or at least enjoy the subject of it, regardless of how they actually feel about them) so eventually some big-wig executive will get an idea and make it.





I'm guessing it'll be as 'funny' as The Big Bang Theory with a varied cast of white people (and their one black/gay/foreign friend) as they struggle with living on their own for the first time. 



Watch them struggle with the concept of cooking, the labours of laundry and the joy of job-hunting. It'll be basically be The Sims: The Series.

In my history classes we were taught that life originated in the Fertile Crescent (somewhere around Baghdad, between the Tigris and the Euphrates, if I am wrong please correct me). That human life originated in the Middle East, where it was once known for its abundance of natural resources. Looking at it today, most of the Fertile Crescent appears to be arid, dry sand where not much will grow. This led some people to suggest that life, humanity as we know it, actually originated in Africa. (Where the origin of crazy shit like Ebola and Marburg came from).  



So my question is: in today's society do we believe life came from the Middle East or from Africa? And if from the Middle East, given the climate and the desert, can we infer that all fertile lands will inevitably become stretches of empty desert?

CVS Employers deny the possibility of tax exempt on a $50 Net10 card (he gets it paid by the university) claiming that it is a "gift card". The Net10 cards are cards that are used to the phone bill every month.



How do I combat this? Is there a real way to shut them up for good?

Dear Reddit,



My grandmother is the trustee for her grandchildren's inheritance that is coming from her Mother's estate. She's looking for options on how to invest the inheritance because the money is not to be dispersed until the grandchildren are 25 years of age. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to go about investing the money?



Thanks!

I've been working for a small company (less than 30 employees) for two years. I'm getting a promotion and going from hourly to salary. I am vaguely aware of the new overtime law and how it will apply to me at 40k/yr. My boss is a huge cheapskate in all aspects of his business, especially when it comes to labor and the treatment of his employees. He keeps stressing how when I move to salary I'm going to have to work 50+ hour weeks. However, I know that he doesn't track the hours of salary employees (I'll be 1 of the 2 people currently on salary).How do I go about ensuring I'm getting paid correctly when it comes to overtime? I have yet to mention this to him because he is VERY intimidating and a huge asshole. It feels like he is expecting me to just not report the overtime I work. I have a feeling that if I did say something about it, he would revoke the offer or try to schmooze me into ignoring it. Not sure how to approach this situation. 



P.S. I only was originally offered 35k and thanks to you guys I had the confidence to counter at 40 and he accepted!

He ask the clerk:"How strong is the effect of this laxative?"



Th clerk says:"There is a public toilet 50 steps away from this store, if you take the laxative now, exits the store and run straight there, as you sit down on a toilet your poops will be pouring out."



The old man seem satisfied, he bought the laxative, took it and exits the store.



After 5 minutes, he returned to the store.



The clerk asked:"What happened? It didn't work?."



The old man answered:"No, it works fine. I am just here to tell you the public toilet is actually 52 steps away."

The guy sees this and thinks to himself, "I bet a steak is way cheaper than what I usually buy at this store, I should try that!" So the next day he cooks up a well done steak, takes it to the store, and when the cashier rings him up, puts it on the counter. The cashier looks a bit concerned and says, "Sir, I'm sorry, but we can't accept this as payment." "What do you mean?" says the man. "Just yesterday I saw someone pay with a steak and there was no problem at all!" "Yes sir," the cashier replies, "it's legal tender."

So my buddy G was in New York for a couple days, because his parents are millionaires. He and his whole family was there and getting back Saturday night. G's house is huge. Has a basketball court in the basement, it's in a gated community, pool etc. 



So G texts me Friday after noon asking what I was doing that night and I responded with "not sure yet, aren't you in NYC still?" And he said "Yeah bro, you trying to hang at my house?" 

And of course I wanted to I was just kinda confused why he would invite me over when he wasn't home. Then again, G isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. He said me and 5 of our buddies can take one car over there, and park in the garage. 



So we did and were hooping, few of us had a couple beers, had a sober driver. It was about midnight and we were about to clean up and head out, when my friend C accidentally butt dialed the emergency 911 on his Samsung s5. It asked for his name and address where he was at, and he said it's happened before when he was at his house, and he just tells them there is no emergency and they don't do anything.



We clean everything up and head to the garage (door open) and start loading up the car. Illegal stuff in the trunk, and halfway through the packing we see headlights coming down the street heading to G's house. We shut the garage door for the sake of illegal shit (alcohol, little weed). He banged on the garage door; it was a cop. 



C went out to talk to the cop, and he called all of us out and got our information. G is about to turn 18 so he can't legally let us be there without his parents consent, so the cop asks for me to call G and put his parents on. I give the phone to the cop and he calls me back and says "hey tell your dumbass friend I can tell he's pretending to be his dad. He'll have to be a little smarter than that. I wanna let you guys go, but legally I need consent." 



So G put his dad on and said we could go. Cop asked us to pop the trunk and saw the bong and alcohol and said "don't get pulled over on your way home. Also don't rip on your buddy (C) too much." 



TL;DR - Stayed at my buddies mansion while he was out of town. Butt dialed the police. No legal trouble but shitty parents.

Near the end of the last episode when Randy was describing Star Wars and how everything now a days is "'member.....member! member.....", it struck a chord in me. I see clearly the exact meaning of the 'member berries, now I see the metaphor clearly.





Entertainment is just destroyed by nostalgia. Nothing is original anymore, imagine how many fresh original ideas would have been made if the energy was put toward new original ideas instead of remakes?I get nostalgic too, we all do, but god damn this show made a point, nothing is original anymore. People hype shit up all the time, the show was right. The latest Star Wars was not even all that great. On the front page of Reddit today, people were excited about the Nintendo Switch remastering Elder Scroll's Skyrim. That game was released 5 years ago and me and every other gamer played it to death, I want something new, but obviously not everybody. Instead people are excited about a remastered Skyrim. This was exactly South Park's point. People are being consumed by their nostalgia and creativity is being suffered because of it. Its ok to be nostalgic and play your old video games and remember your childhood, but its no ok to want remakes and remasters all the time. Thank you South Park. You are always wise......





TL;DR - People are excited about a remastered Skyrim, rather than wanting a new Elder Scroll's game after 5 years

There seems to be a real lack of lan gaming cafe's in London (probably good reason too).  Maybe they generally aren't done well, but just wanted to get a feel for how popular this would be.  



I'd try and make it more of a immersive social experience with tournaments, players of the week,  start players displayed on a big main screen and awards given out.   



No COD players allowed, obviously :)

I don't know why money and my personal finances make me so anxious. They really, really shouldn't. I'm looking for any tips to combat this stress and worry, because my parents haven't been able to help me. They don't understand why I'm so worried about all this. I don't either.



So, I'm 19. I was raised upper-middle class and my parents were both raised in blue collar households. Something in this led me to not particularly care for *things*. Even as a child I felt incredibly guilty whenever I stopped playing with a toy I had bought, no matter how many months of joy it brought me.



My parents set up a great college savings for myself and my two other siblings. I will not graduate with debt, and neither will my brother, because we are going to state schools. My sister who went to an Ivy league will as graduate debt free and with her college savings intact as the military is paying for her education.



All great, fantastic, yeah? I have a savings account of my own (from allowance, odd jobs, that sort of thing) of 11k.



I was fired from my first ever job for being disabled (who other post by itself) and just recently got a new job that's much better. I'm still recovering from the hit on my self esteem for the termination. 



So that's my situation. I have a strict budget. Now that I have a paycheck I'm not longer draining my savings.



But I'm still so anxious and stressed. Putting together the budget, even when it was all just coming out of my savings, helped. It made me feel in control.



I thought having a paycheck would help, knowing that I am building up my saving's even more. Knowing that one day I'll be able to own my own house. Reading this subreddit and starting to understanding how down payments and stuff works helped even more.



But in the grand scheme of things I'm still so anxious. I beat myself up for losing my wallet post surgery a while back, even though, drugged out of my mind, there was nothing I could have done to prevent it. Every little unexpected expense gets to me, and I second guess it. Even though I do budget for those sorts of things.



Does it get better? This worrying about money? I'm making a little less than $500 a month. My room and board and about 1/4 of my food is paid for by my scholarships and college savings, accounts I never see.



Shouldn't I be carefree about money right now? I mean, my spending only comes out to $267 a month. That's the lowest it'll ever be.



Yet still I worry. Does anyone have any advice? Does it get better? How do I not worry so much? How do I feel financially secure.

Some backstory:



Currently, my work is offering me a health insurance plan that costs ~$50/month via HSA. I'm full time, and will be making ~$30,000 this year, and ~50,000 next year. 



Until now, I was always on my parents health insurance plan, and thusly, I want to shop around. I'm 21, not married male, and I don't get sick; I haven't been to a doctor or hospital within the last five years. I have a low risk job, and I'm in the prime of my youth, I just want to save as much money as I can knowing full well that I will not utilize the health insurance company in any way over the course of next year. 



In short, I need help finding the absolute cheapest premium on the  cheapest bronze health insurance plan that meets the U.S government's guidelines. My enrollment for my work ends in the next couple days, while shopping on nationally sponsored website healthcare.gov doesn't begin until the first. Any help would be both greatly utilized, appreciated, and passed on to the next future generation!

I remember once when my dad gave me money to pay the electricity bill but instead I bought a raffle ticket for a brand new car. When I got home, I explained to my dad what I did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day, when my dad woke up and opened the door, outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me, because the car was from the electricity company, they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again

Hi.  So my wife may have a PT job.  The business she is joining will have 3 employees with my wife.  I don't know if they will sponsor a 401k plan.   What options would my wife have to contributing to a 401k plan?



Myself - I am starting a new job with the fed gov't.  My last job sponsored and funded an HSA? plan.  I have no funds in that account that I can access.  New job allows me to contribute to an FSA plan.  Would I be able to do that this year?  Or do I have to wait till 2017?  Im only allowed to start an FSA plan within 60 days of my start date which was a week ago.



Thanks

I'm able to run The Witcher 23-30 fps on low, Fallout 4 30-40fps on med-low. I'm just wondering if I'll be able to enjoy the remaster of one of my favorite games.



Thanks!

When I was very young, I remember playing through Ocarina of Time. At the very end when you had to fight Beast Ganon, the cutscene that shows after the castle collapses and he shoots up from the rubble and transforms, and then during the fight I just had intense chill bumps all over , then that final cutscene when Zelda holds Ganon down with the power of the sages and link delivers that final blow to Ganon's head, oh man, to this day still gives me chills. But however. This was not my first "emotional" memory from a video games. It was more like my first most intense memory. When I was in about 2nd or 3rd grade I believe, I had Star Wars: Republic Commando. I loved this game. In my young mind it was basically Halo but re-skinned as Star Wars (as I was a huge Halo fan). Anyway the game was amazing, and one character I had a strong tie with. Sev. The sniper. The Commando with a blood splatter hand print on his helmet. He was my absolute favorite. *Spoiler* at the very end of the game, when the team of commandos were being over-run by too many enemies and were trying to escape, Sev got left behind and said he'd meet them at the LZ (or something of the sort. I haven't played the game in quite some time). When the commandos almost make it to their exit, Sev comes across the scanner and says, "Guys...there's too many of them.. I'm not making it out of here, alive.. you'll have to go on without me." Immediately I was heart broken.. After fighting back and forth over the scanner, the Commandos realize there is no way to save Sev, so they leave. As a kid I hated this. I thought about Sev for the rest of the week and I talked with my friends at school about it and I remember them agreeing that it sucked lol so anyway. I was just wondering, what's you guys first emotional gaming memory?? (Sorry for the long post btw)

I'm on the train writing this, it literally happened a few hours ago. I decided to go home for my University's study break and booked a train. Me being the irresponsible traveler I am, i'm just scrolling through reddit instead of getting ready. Eventually it hits the time where I realize i'm probably going to miss my train if I don't get moving. Now earlier I had started charging my new iPhone that I got after shattering the screen on my old phone. I have a very long charging cable and it tends to get wrapped around things very easily. This is where the fuck up begins. In my rush I hadn't noticed the cable wrapped around my shoes, and when I jumped up to get ready the cable swung the phone up and slammed it on the ground with the strength of Hercules himself. So here I am on the train with my cracked phone, cutting myself trying to entertain myself on social media.

Hi guys,



Sorry if this isn't the right place, I'm really just crowdsourcing advice.



I've lived in the UK for three years and worked for two, though I am actually from the US and will be moving back there next year. For the past year (since I've known I would be moving back), I've sent my savings home every month, but I have a portfolio here (including investments, pension, emergency and some regular savings) of around £12k. 



As I watch the ££ plummet in value compared to the dollar, it doesn't seem to make sense for me to keep sending home money every month (sending home £400 before Brexit got me $580, now it's down to $480). If this were normal currency fluctuations, I wouldn't mind just holding out for a year or two before transferring any money overseas (I have a solid portfolio at home, and won't *need* any of this next year specifically), but I get the impression that this could be a multi-decade issue.



Basically, my question is: continue transferring home monthly savings, and then do a lump sum when the exchange rate looks best? Or hold out until the GBP recovers, whenever that may be? Having just done the math, I stand to lose about 20% of my money here if I transfer it home now (compared to if I had done so in May or June).



Thanks in advance for any of your thoughts!

John decided to go skiing with his buddy, Keith. So they loaded up John's minivan and headed north.



After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night



'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.'



'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.



Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way.



They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.



But about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend.



He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about 9 months ago?' 'Yes, I do.' Said Keith.



'Did you, ER, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?'



'Well, um, yes!,' Keith said, a little embarrassed about being found out, 'I have to admit that I did.'



'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?'



Keith's face turned beet red and he said, 'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why do you ask?'



'She just died and left me everything.'

Some of my old student debt is $3000 at about 3% APY. Currently I'm paying $140 a month for it. At this rate it should be paid off in about 2 years. Or I can pay it off early and stop paying the extra $140 per month (although only $8/month interest). But I have minimal savings and I wanted to build a $10k emergency fund just in case (I have access to about $25 credit card credit). Any suggestions?

Hi everyone! I'm thinking of getting Battlefield 1 on PC but I'm hesitant considering the history of PC ports as a whole. To those of you who've gotten the chance to play Battlefield 1 on PC. How well does it run? Is it well optimized? Would you recommend it over grtting the PS4 version?

So I live in Latvia and I'm finishing my major (English Philology) right now. I speak Latvian, Russian and English fluently; I have a fairly good knowledge of Swedish and I can *understand* a dozen of other languages. I also can do pretty much anything that requires mental work if I'm mentored on the subject. 



That being said, I've been struggling to find a job for months already. 99% of available jobs are IT based, and when I went to a job fair, 100% of employers were seeking for IT people. Ugh. 



Of course, there are companies working with languages, but there are so many people in our country speaking English/Russian that employers don't give a damn about the fact that my language competence is a bit higher than that of an average Jānis. 



As concerns translation agencies, the amount of money they pay... ugh, McDonalds pays more. 



And as for teaching someone, everyone looks for native speakers and don't even want to consider someone who's not. 



I'm anxious about the whole thing and I've lately been considering moving to Sweden or even the U.S. (or basically anywhere I can get a job lol, nothing's holding me back here), but I feel like I won't find anything but IT there as well (the more so when google finally finishes their "machine translating" project). 



Someone might say "but hey just learn programming", but I don't like that. I've taught myself the basics and I don't enjoy it.



Right now it feels like all I did was just postponed my job application to some UK factory by 4 years. 



Are there any other options for me?

I despise tactical shooters with super high TTK. They all play the exact same to me for the most part. I like games with lots of movement. Gears of War, Unreal Tournament, TF2 scout etc. Way more high octane and skill based IMO.



Thing is I don't know a soul who plays on PC and the people who do have mics all sound like they've never been outside a day in their life so it makes me feel weird. I don't want to play with them.



Also the player base on these great games (UT2016, Quake Live, not sure about Toxikk) just seems horrendous. I'd probably also play L4D2. I hear DOOM MP is dead on PC. Not too much interest in single player games unless internet is out. I would play something like Fallout for that. I guess I could also look at halo online. I hear GOW4 is dead on PC.



What am I supposed to do?

Posting from my phone, so the usual spelling/formatting caveats apply.



You know that old titbit about women in their early 30s reaching peak arousal? Urgh. It's no joke.



I'm a 32 year old woman with next to no dating experience and, as you can imagine, no relationship history. There are several factors at play here, including childhood abuse and being of below average appearance, but there are a lot of happily coupled people with a similar story so I know these aren't necessarily prohibitive. I spent my early 20s dealing with the self-esteem issues and self-loathing that accompany abuse (which was, on occasion, also sexual in nature), and psychologically I'm doing well. I feel confident and as comfortable with the past as I can be, and this has been the case since around the age of 28. I'm popular, to my surprise, and fortunate enough to have a solid, stable career and a good education which I continue to pursue. However, I've not made any progress in terms of dating, and I feel stuck and don't know how to proceed. This is where your advice or commiseration would be invaluable! Of course, I socialise (not in bars, because I can't be someone I'm not, but at public events) and have explored internet dating, but no successes yet.



The major problem is that I'm rarely attracted to anyone. Ever. I can count on one hand the number of people I've been attracted to. I'm heavy (and working on it, but the body can take longer to fix than the mind!) but I do attract some guys so I feel this is less of an issue than my younger self believed. I lost my virginity at the age of 30 to a friend I made while travelling (we're 6,000 miles apart, before anyone suggests a FWB situation) and, while I've had issues with it, I can't say I altogether regret it because hey, it's the only experience I've got. I do feel guilty about having sex outside a relationship but the guy was polite and respectful and I didn't think the offer would come up again. The guilt I've felt about sleeping with this man is the reason why I don't pursue sex independently to a relationship. Since having sex with him (it was a handful of times) I've occasionally felt tarnished and "not pristine" enough for an actual boyfriend, so perhaps my sexual abuse issues aren't quite, well, put to bed yet! I'd hoped, as many young people do, to have sex with someone who loves me (especially after the abusive incidents), but I felt like it was never going to happen, so I went with the guy who offered. It was more about finding some peace with myself rather than exploring feelings with and for another person, as I'd intended. In hindsight, I sometimes feel tacky and whoreish. Sometimes I'm okay with it and think "Dear God, woman, you held out until 30! Give yourself a break!"



This leads me to believe FWB is out of the question. Not that I have a friend to ask (my friends are largely female or taken etc), but it would help me with the substantial sexual frustration I feel. I've always had a high libido but right now it's off the scale. I liked sex and am disappointed to have already missed so many years of doing it. I've forgotten how it feels and it's hard to imagine being in a situation where it's available again. My youth is disappearing and it feels misspent in worry.



So, the obvious thing is that I need a partner, but it's tricky when my romantic feelings are few and far between. Do you think there's some connection between my history and the inability to develop feelings for someone? It's certainly not conscious but maybe there's a very deep-rooted fear at play. I'm no longer in counselling and can put myself back on the waiting list but, NHS being as short of resources as it is, and me not being a suicidal or urgent case, it'll be six months or so before I can talk this through with a pro. I wouldn't say I'm choosy about men - there's no mental checklist of attributes etc - I'm either attracted to you or I'm not. And boy, if I could make myself feel something for someone I don't, my horny self would have done it (and him) by now.



The problem is exacerbated by the fact I do have a current crush. The first in a long time. However, he doesn't seem to care that I'm alive. Well, no, he's a good person, so that's a little harsh. Better to say he doesn't care if our lives intersect. We're not friends per se, but we have a semi-professional relationship, so I've been as indicative of my feelings as I can without putting him in the awkward position of having to say no. He's given me a few signals I interpreted as interest but, on reflection, I'm obviously inexperienced and probably misreading normal courtesy. I haven't seen him in a while, and our business has concluded so I don't expect to see him again, so I believe this is a dead end. 



I could be frustrated about other things, e.g. the hindrance to having a family without a man, but I'm very self-sufficient and I don't think there's anything I can't achieve alone, be it raising children, buying property, even having an orgasm. But wouldn't it be nice not to have to do everything alone? I've got a lot of love, care and respect to give, and nowhere to put them. My heart and my life, to some degree, feel wasted. Redditors, what would you do in order to move forward?



(This turned out to be really long. Sorry about that; I guess I needed to vent. I've many friends but few I can be this vulnerable with. The ones I can have their own difficulties right now. If you read all of this, I thank and applaud you. Perhaps you should consider an English Lit evening class!)



TL;DR: I've never been in a relationship and have limited sexual experience. It's starting to feel like it won't happen, and the loneliness/sexual frustration is growing.

A husband and wife were having dinner at a very

fine restaurant when an absolutely stunning

young woman comes over to their table, gives the

husband a big open-mouthed kiss, then says

she'll see him later and walks away.



The wife glares at her husband and says, "Who in the hell was that?"



"Oh," replies the husband, "She's my mistress."



"Well, that's the last straw," says the wife. "I've had enough. I want a divorce!"



"I can understand that," replies her husband, "But remember, if we get a divorce it will mean no more

shopping trips to Paris, no more wintering in Barbados,  no more summers in Tuscany, no more Jaguar in the garage, and no more 

yacht club. Not only that,  but no more diamonds, no more credit card, and large bank account. But the decision is all yours."



Just then, a mutual friend of

theirs enters the restaurant with a gorgeous babe on his arm.



"Who's that woman with Bobby?" asks the wife. "That's his mistress," says the husband 

                                                                  The wife looks at him for a second and then says,



"Ours is prettier!"

I have a 670m GeForce video card, a 2.3 Ghz processor that is not overclockable, and its a Laptop, Specifically the Asus G75VW. I want to get a new computer that will serve me for a long time but I don't have that much money. Is there any good build or laptop that has at least a 970, 2.6 Ghz, less than $900 and if a laptop can be used as a desktop

My question is, how do we know that the things they're teaching us are indeed true?

We usually refuse to believe mythological stories because they contradict science. Because they're not scientific. But how do we know that the scientific things are actual things and not made up?



I was debating a friend about some topic, and he responded with "Okay. So let's say my beliefs are wrong. How do you know that these scientific things you're saying are true? Why do you believe them when there's no proof you can see that they're true. Scientists say there is proof. But how do you know they're not lying?"



So this pretty much sums up my question.  Why do we believe scientific theories when we, as ordinary people leading a normal life, in many cases cannot see the actual evidence? Why do we take their word for it?

The gods were planning on where to spend their next vacations; Shiva suggested: "what about Neptune?", then Ala said: "It's too cold!"; Zeus then suggested: "Let's go to Mars!", then Buddha replied "Nah, we went there last time!". So someone spoke "What about Earth?", for God to reply: "no way, Earth people like to gossip too much. I went there 2000 years ago, had a thing with a virgin and they're still talking about it!"

So far, I am very impressed by graphic style and overlay. They really outdid themselves with animations and lighting effects. The combat animations are VERY fluid, especially watching horsemen mow down infantry and spearman poke scouts and flip them over!



I'm loving the government system too, the card system is very neat and more fun to micro manage than social policies.



Also...Sean Bean.



Some great features from Civ 5 are missing, tourism doesn't seem to provide any bonuses beyond accruing a cultural victory, religion seems more basic without founder belief bonuses (could be wrong about this), and tooltips seem somewhat lacking (you need to go to the civpedia to remember what wonders you have do).



As with Civ 5, I'm sure we'll see things more fleshed out with expansions.

My company announced they are going to freeze my pension contributions as of January 2019.  I will be 53 at that time.  The company will offer a lump sum at that time.  I don’t know an exact amount yet but my best guess is that it will be around $750,000 at that time (Jan 2019).  401k Contributions currently 7% + 6% company matching.  In January 2019 they will contribute an additional 4% to 401k  in lieu of the pension plan that is freezing.

I plan to work till 62. (12 years) and spouse till 54  ( 6years)

I need to determine where to roll that lump sum pension money to.  We have next to no ROTH set up but our combined income is around $150,000 so we currently need the tax deferred contributions of the traditional 401K and would prefer to avoid the tax hit we would take rolling anything into ROTH now.





My Age 50, Spouse 48

Mortgage balance 185,000 on a $340,000 house

My Employer Sponsored 401K : $213,894

My traditional IRA :  $24,881

Social Security Estimate at age 67 :  $2527



Spouse office just started their 401k plan a couple years ago.  Contributing 3% with 3% matching.  

Spouse 401K :  $10,000 (Est) ROTH

Spouse IRA :  $290,000 

Social Security Estimate at 67 :  $2000

 Estimate Pension Lump sum I need to roll over in January 2018: 750,000



So where should I place the estimated $750,000 pension roll over when it happens in 2019?

Ok so it's been a while since I read the book, but when I read it I got a sense of ominousness and gloom. The book was even blood-chilling at points (the pictures were very eerie) and reading it at night made it haunting in a way. The trailer, however, seems very colorful and light-hearted, almost magical and majestic. This made me upset because if anything, this book should be turned into an eerie movie. Thoughts?

I had a Lasik consult yesterday and am pre-emptively scheduled for the $4000 procedure next week. I have the cash,  but it's my entire emergency fund so I'd rather open a 0% APR Care Credit Line and pay it off in 18 months. The procedure is not covered by my insurance and I do not have an HSA.



I am almost legally blind so I'd love to do the procedure ASAP and be able to see like a normal person!  



Is the procedure tax deductible in the year it is performed, or the year it is paid? I will not be itemizing on my 2015 return, but will be on my 2016 return and if I pay off the Lasik completely next year, will have the 10% of AGI to itemize.



Is there anything else I'm not thinking of?

I am the owner of a Vizio E320-B0 TV, and it's being less than cooperative with regards to legacy consoles. When I try to use my SNES or N64, I get an "Unsupported Mode" message- it doesn't happen with my Gamecube, luckily. This also doesn't happen on the Sanyo in the living room, although it looks awful since it's a 46". 

  

I need to get rid of the CRT, but I want to be able to play legacy consoles without the bullshit. What's going on, and how can I fix it? My best guess right now is a Composite>HDMI switch, since I tried a cable converter box and it didn't work.

Although cable networks have usually produced less episodes per season than their broadcast brothers for many years, I think it has really become more prevalent with the rise of streaming services.  So, I was just wondering what everyone thought of it.



For myself, I love the shorter seasons (13 or less episodes).  It allows me to view more series while never getting bored after the 20+ episode.  Thoughts?

When I cross one leg over the other, the crossed leg 'falls asleep' and I'm unable to walk on it for a period of time (e.g., for 2 minutes after uncrossing). During this time period, I have a fair amount of discomfort in the leg.

The formula for the critical angle is

Arcsin(n2/n1), and as sin only takes values from 1 to -1, n2 always has to be smaller for it to work.

Is it impossible for it to occur if n2 is greater, if so why?

Or is there a different formula.

Good afternoon, I'm D.S. Ryelle, author of *Barefoot on the Couch*, *Exilium* and several more books. Thursday marks three years since I released my fourth (and possibly most controversial) book *Early One Morning*, a historical drama that was meant to feature a Pagan priestess getting dragged into the trial of Jesus, but ended up being a freewheeling mix of anger, romance and power struggles. *Early One Morning* was followed by the previously mentioned *Exilium*, and will eventually be accompanied by prequel *The Devil's Bride* and a second sequel, *Maggie Have I Known*.



Since the entire seven hour block seemed pretty daunting, I'll just be here from 2-5p Eastern (11a-2p Pacific, 5-8p Brit). In case you don't believe me, ~~here's the proof of my subservience to cats~~ [my humanity] (https://twitter.com/DayaRyelle/status/781564208819298304). I also have a [site](http://dsryelle.wordpress.com), but no dot com, as I've always been a starving ~~artist~~ novelist, and a [GoodReads page](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7359763.Dayanara_Ryelle).





I'll try to keep up with questions and commentary as best I can, so don't worry if I don't get to you right away! (And please feel free to discuss any of my other books, if you've read them.)









**FAQ**



*Do we -have- to talk about "Early One Morning"?*

Not unless you want to.



*What's with all the strikethroughs?*

It's the equivalent of a cheeky aside or whispering under your breath on a game I play. Feel free to use it. ;)





*Why did Jesus/Yeshua tell Julia to call him Josh? Isn't that too modern?*

Not exactly. According to my research, Yeshua is the Aramaic form of the name Joshua; so theoretically, if the apostles spoke modern English, then yes, they might have called him Josh. ~~When they weren't busy calling him "master".~~



For the curious, Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua; while in formal Hebrew, he would have been called Yehoshua.





*What are you working on now?*

A whole lot of nothing! I was working on an adaptation of *A Christmas Carol*, but I must have gotten too proud of myself, because my muses suddenly shut up!

Should I try to refinance my condo mortgage again to try to lock in a lower rate and reduce monthly payments?  Please have a look at my picture:





Details:    

*Condo: valued ~$425,000 in Bay Area, California    

*Current mortgage: $205,000 @ 4.05% 30yr fixed = monthly payments of $985    

*Refinanced in June 2015, but condo was not owner-occupied (so higher rate), but I now live in it.  This is why I want to refinance with rates still being low.    

*No other debt, pay all credit cards in full, <5% utilization rate    

*Credit score ~750-760    

*$60k in 401k, $11k in rIRA, $5,500 in tIRA, $20k savings    





However:    

*Just changed jobs last month.  Same industry, slightly higher pay, ~$76k gross    

*I churn, so I opened 5 credit cards since refinancing.. 2x in July '15, 1x in April '16, and 2x in July '16.    





So.. will my recent change in jobs and quite a few new lines of credit hurt my chances?  Is it worth it to try to refinance again and take advantage of owner-occupied rates and lock in a lower rate now?

Pretty basic question but this sub seemed the most fitting!  I routinely use all 3 types, I use borax with my laundry and boric&orthoboric for ant&bug baits and dusting,  but am wondering what differences, if any, there are amongst these 3 forms (if they are in fact different forms!)



My curiosity was piqued when reading a product label, an ant bait product, and it said *"sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Borax)"*, when other products on the shelf next to it were saying 'orthoboric acid' - is this stuff the same or are these different?  It's disconcerting to think an insecticide is a laundry additive as well!



Any help in understanding/differentiating these is appreciated, thanks guys!!

Very Very good film. 

If you can handle it i Recommend you to see it in 3D or even IMAX 3d if you can.

The magic scenes  are very well done and make the screen come alive.

The  crazy mind bender scenes are made for 3d.

However  if the cost for 3d is way more probably skip it  as there maybe is a total of 12 minutes of scenes worth it the rest can be done in normal mode 



Bendict still comes off as a little broody,and a few scenes it seems like he just phoned in his performance.



MadSMikelson or whatever his name is one of the better bad guy's





Now to look forward to a SHIELD  tie in with the TV show as it's clearly heading there.



All in all it's not perfect. the pacing is way off.

It doesn't flesh out "magic" enough, it's pretty much like Oh yeah this thing exists  cool  now move on. and it could be a bit longer.

Hi everyone,



I'm a full-time employee with an older Infiniti that runs well but has had some issues, and I am looking into a good deal on a used Honda Accord. The only problem is that I've only got $2-3k of the $8k the seller is asking for. I generally have $800-1,000 left over every month, which I was putting toward my student loans before. I have a $5.5k emergency fund, so for this I'd be taking a chunk out of my emergency fund and then leaving a bit in it just to have a safe amount to fall back on.



Would getting a used auto loan be advisable in a situation like this? I have a pretty good credit score and history. I'd be able to pay off the loan in a few months (five to six months), but I'm not sure if the interest charged each month would even make it worth it.



Thoughts?

... Eventually they ended up parked at lover's point where they started making out. After things started getting pretty good, he thought he might get lucky, so he asked her, "Do you want to go in the back seat?" "No!" she answered. Okay, he thought, maybe she's not ready yet. Now he has her shirt and skirt off, the windows are steamed, and things are getting really hot, so he asks again, "Do you want to go in the back seat?" "No!" she answers again. Now he has her bra off, they're both very sweaty, and she even has his pants unzipped. Okay, he thinks, she HAS to want it now. "Do you want to go in the back seat?" he asks again. "No!" she answers yet again. Frustrated, he demands, "Well why not?" "Because I want to stay up here with you!"

I found it to be a refreshing sci-fi. I personally liked the acting and from what I've read I'm in the minority but it felt genuine especially since the characters are scientists. Also the last third seems to me a likely inspiration to Prometheus. 



What did you think about it?

I've been a member at NECU(.org) since around 1998, I live in NH.  



Lately I'm getting very annoyed with their continued investing in placing ad's everywhere to generate membership, rather than having better savings rates or having better service for members. 



Would anyone have suggestions for other CU's in the area? Does longevity mean anything to a CU? Am I losing out in anything if I go to a different CU? Currently I have checking, savings, and a low interest cc with them. Rates on both checking and savings are near non-existent. 



Considering ServiceCU.org if that makes any difference.

TIFU last week, not today. 



It all started in my little flight abroad. I took business class and enjoyed the free food that came with it. With the amount I hate my ass was like a dam holding back my vast reserves if shit. 



I went to the bathroom to led it go, and damn, it shot out at power similar to a .50 cal. 



After letting my volcano erupt, I went to reach for the majestic ass spray... great. The water power was under 9000. Barley any water came out of the spray. Couldn't wash my ass with that, so like a North American, I had to use toilet paper only. 



I've only ever used toilet paper once before, and that was when some cunty kid broke the water sprays in the bathroom. So I wiped, and wiped my poor virgin asshole. I wiped with force. Too much force.



I probably wiped for what was 10 minutes because I wanted to make sure my precious asshole was clean, as water is a easier method to clean with.



Few hours later on the flight my asshole was itching... it hurt. It felt like ants were probing around there like poor Eric Cartmen in the South Park pilot. It felt like satan was tickling his pickle with my asshole.



After more unbearable itchiness and pain, I went to the bathroom to see the damage. It was a bit awkward tryna look down there, but it was red. It burnt. Trying to put cream there after the flight only lead to what felt like I was being fisted by satan himeself.



TL;DR I am not a good North American.

There have been a lot of posts that say



1) that time travel doesn't exist or we would have proof already



2) that it is possible, but people don't travel to our time because it's dangerous or boring



3) that it is possible, but we will never see it because timelines will always split off



4) that it hasn't been discovered yet



but maybe it's just the time cops doing their job... and they've been really good at cleaning up messes... after all, their technology would be far superior to ours.

Hi guys, as the title says really. I'm from the UK and this Christmas I'm treating a family member who has had a terrible year to a holiday to the US for 4 days, although in order to book flights and accommodation now I've come to the conclusion I need to get a credit card to cover the initial costs. 



I have no problems whatsoever in paying back my spend, but I want to find a 0% card which is interest free for an extended period of time. 



Everyone has pointed towards this deal http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/best-0-credit-cards



Spending length: 28 months 0% | Card issuer: Mastercard | Min income: N/A Minimum repayment: Greater of 1% of balance plus interest, 2.25% or £5



In layman's terms, is this a good deal?

Now before anyone questions it, no, a fire watch doesn't sit in the lookout tower 24/7. In my case, I've been asked multiple times to go check on certain things to make sure everything is still in working order.



As a little back story, I was hired around May 29 of 2016 to a national forest near my home city in south-western Montana. For sake of anonymity, we'll just call it Honey Rock. Honey Rock was a nice park, coming in at 5,247 square miles. I was stationed about 97 miles from the center of the forest.



Now, Honey Rock is a nice peaceful place with plenty of campsites. However, like all national forests, we had a fairly large Search and Rescue team on constant standby.



So, to my job. My tower was actually pretty nice. There was a bed, a table, and (thankfully), a close by outhouse. It was looking up to be a pretty decent summer. Thankfully there isn't much activity storm-wise going on, but you never know when some idiot doesn't put out their campfire or throws out their cigarette buds.

now to the story. At this time, I'm in my lookout tower, trying to solve a crossword puzzle and my boss radio's me in saying that there's an "incident" I need to look into. After confirming the location, I grab my bag and start heading out, the designated location only half a mile south of me. When I arrive, it's the usual: someone didn't put out their campfire.



I start walking up to the fire pit, but stop suddenly. There was a strange feeling that I couldn't shake. I looked around, but saw nothing. I looked back to the fire pit and something caught my eye. There was a small piece of paper being weighed down by a rock, just adjacent to the fire pit.



Upon closer inspection, I see that it's a small drawing, presumably made by a small child, of him/herself holding the hand of what looks like a tall, skinny humanoid figure. The figure was drawn in all black and seemed kinda static looking. To be honest, it freaked the heck out of me. There was something very disturbing about that picture.



After putting out the fire, I made my way back to my station. Just as I turn to leave, though, I could hear a small snap on the opposite side of me, from the tree line.



I froze.



"Sam, is that you?" (Sam is one of the few friends I made here. He's stationed about 90 miles north of me.)



No answer.



"I swear, it ain't funny."



Still nothing.



After just rationalizing for a bit, thinking it must have be a squirrel or something, I decide to just turn and leave. After entering my tower, the sun beginning its descent, I slump down in my chair and stare outside at the sky. I still felt that sudden sense of dread, like something... evil was looming over me. I was worried about that picture.



"Steve"



I wake up, realizing that I must have drifted off. The sun was just past halfway below the horizon, casting it's brilliant oranges and soft pinks into the evening sky. I pick up my radio and answer the call.



"Boss? What's Up?"



The was a slight pause. "You know that campsite I sent you to?"



"Uh, yeah" I replied, a little worried.



Another pause. "Did you notice anything... strange?"



I sat still for a moment. "Boss, what's wrong?"



I could hear worry in his voice. "Apparently one of the kids of the family that stayed there went missing. The father says he just up and disappeared."



Now it was my turn to worry. "Has SaR been sent out yet?"

"They were sent out about five minutes ago. Looks like we're gonna need a little help."



"Roger that" was all I could say.



The search party consisted of all of SaR and the fire watch team. It was nearing close to eleven when we got the first sign of the kid. Sam ran up to us, a small object in his hand.



It was a shoe.



"Found this, thought it might be the kids." Sam said, almost nonchalantly.



Just as the Boss was about to say something, we heard an SaR officer shout a couple yards away.



"He's here!"



Everyone rushed over to him. He walked up, a small boy in his arms looking as if nothing happened at all. The kids mom and dad ran up and grabbed him, hugging him like they were afraid he would disappear again, tears streaming down their faces.

"We were so worried! Don't you ever wander off alone again!" The mother exclaimed.



"But I wasn't alone, momma."



My heart felt like it had stopped. I turned and looked at the kid.



"What do you mean?" The dad asked.



"I was with the blurry man. he was really nice to me. He gave me berries and we walked for a while. It was so fun!"



It was my turn to ask questions, almost scared of what the answer would be. "What did the blurry man look like?" I asked, swallowing hard.



"Well, he was really tall, and skinny, too. He didn't have much color, like black and stuff, but his body was really blurry. Kinda like looking at something through water."



I remembered the picture. That's what I didn't want to here. Eventually, we headed back to the main area and the family took their leave, their son firmly in hand. After a small clean up, we were all dismissed back to our stations for the night. I could barely get any sleep that night. I was afraid that the snapped twig might have been something else, something like the kid had described. I just sat in my tower and watched as the sun rose in the morning, not a single bit of sleep gotten.



It's been awhile since this incident, and most of us have gotten over it all, but there are some days where I can't help but remember finding that picture at the campsite and the missing kid being found as if nothing had happened. It terrifies me to think of what might have happened if we never found the kid.



Well, that was a bit long! Sorry about that, I couldn't quite get my thoughts together. This is just one of many stories I have from that summer, and I hope you guys will stay tuned for those! Thanks!

I have been studying Humanities and Social Sciences at an Bachelor and Masters level now for 4 years, and have, reluctantly accepted the use of Academic English in my writing. My question however, is why do we use such a complicated form of English to get our ideas across. I do understand why there needs to be a certain form of professionalism involved, and I also understand the use of jargon in any field, scientific or not. My question is just that what is wrong with using a professional English language, including jargon, rather than these sometimes highly and increasingly strange and, simply put, hard to understand sentences and paragraphs? I feel it comes from some sort of monopoly on information, but hope that I am wrong. Hope someone can help me.

My wife's parents will likely declare bankruptcy soon (in Colorado). Her dad is paid on commission and hasn't made any income in a couple months, while her mom has been out of work. While we haven't cosigned any loans or anything with them, I need some advice on what to do. My wife and I do financially fine for ourselves, but are young (23) and are trying to build savings. 



My wife's car is still in her dad's name, so he has 3 cars in total under his name. I assume he will lose one of them, as I doubt the bankruptcy court let's you keep 3 cars for 2 people (my wife's dad and mom). We are starting the process of transferring the car into my wife's name, but since the transfer is close to filing, will we lose that car? 



What are their housing options? I assume they will likely lose their house. My wife and I live in a one bedroom apartment, but could make it work having them move in if living on the streets is their only other option. 



Since they have no income, my wife and I will likely have to pay for their living expenses for awhile. How do I handle this? While my wife and I have been smart about our budgeting, it's difficult to suddenly have 2 dependants. 



Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Hi everyone



I'm finally moving out within the next year and I'm so excited as its been my life goal.



Anyways when I move out I plan to have least 10k In the bank. After that I will probably be able to save away 800-1000 a month. This will leave me no money to do anything else but eat , live , and go to work. I understand that saving is really important but when  is it okay to chill out a bit and start putting away less? If I want to take a trip that month and will only out away 500 that month would It be okay? When can I relax a bit?



Here is an estimate of my living expenses. I dont know how much they'll actually be . Could be way more or way less. I'm splitting everything with my bf I'll be moving with. He has agreed that he will probably have no money left over ( working part time and school) after paying everything. I on the other hand work full-time and will have some more money left over.



I bring home about 2k a month



So rent will be no more then $700 (1300 I'm total) . Rent could be as low as 600 though.



Utilities? I'm estimating  $100 a month but could be more. I'm in NYC and don't know. Could be as low as 50 of split. Not sure.



Transportation? $100.

Cellphone? $50

Wi-Fi ?  $30

Food? About 200-300





So yeah. I'll have about 800ish left over . I'm hoping for a raise before I move out so maybe it'll look better.



Anyways, if I have about 10k saved up ( or more) is it safe to begin to put in less money?or should I just be a zombie and save all i have? I want to feel safe.



Thanks guys!

I work in Carstairs State Hospital for the criminally insane in Scotland. He house the worst of the worst. The most depraved monsters that society has to offer. 90% of the men in here, you won't have heard of. The media is forbidden to report their crimes most of the time as they are far too horrific for public consumption. The crimes that do make the headlines are massively toned down. I could lose my job for disclosing details of past and present patients, but here I am. 



This story I want to tell you is about "The Box Man". You may find snippets about this evil man on the internet but believe me, it'll be massively played down. Here is the he true events. 



It was the late 60s in Glasgows West End. Glasgow was never a stranger to violent crimes and has been home to a lot of horrific murders and depraved attacks over the years. The box man was one such monster that would haunt the city for decades to come. 



Young boys were being sexually assaulted by this stranger for 3 years. The youngest victim being 7 years old and the oldest being 16. The box man used to trawl the city seeking out young vulnerable children who were alone. Possibly on an errand for a friend or a neighbour. He would pull out a small box from under his coat in a dramatic fashion, peaking the child's curiosity. Once he had the child's full interest and attention he would tell the youngster that he had something extremely valuable inside the box and he could only show him what it was if he accompanied him somewhere out of sight of prying eyes. He normally took them to disused shops, office buildings and warehouses but occasionally an alleyway would suffice. 



Once inside his chosen location he would grab the child, showing them a large knife and order them to strip. He would then sexually assault them. It started off as touching the child inappropriately but gradually as time went on, the severity of his crimes increased. 



Children would return home screaming and sobbing about the "Box Man" and what he had subjected them to. This sparked a massive manhunt. Police, parents and even hardened criminals volunteered to help find this despicable person responsible for terrorising the city's children. 



Time dragged on, police had no leads at all. The box man continued his reign of terror on young boys all over Glasgow, his crimes becoming more and more disgusting. 



Jim McPhail. 8 years old. He was found naked running along a main road absolutely hysterical. He had been raped at knife point and his genitals had been mutilated. He made a full physical recovery, but I doubt he would ever get over his ordeal. Police became increasingly desperate. They employed more officers to search for the fiend but still had absolutely nothing to go on. 



Jason Stevenson. 7 years old. Found dead in a disused warehouse in an abandoned industrial estate. He had been raped and beat to death. There was nothing left of his face. Just a bloody mess. He was unrecognisable. 



One day, in 1969 his final crime was the worst of his attacks. It was also the one that got him caught. 



Chris McDade. 16 years old.

Chris had just finished work at a fishmongers when the box man struck. He was walking home after a days work. He was only a few minutes from his mothers house but it was a destination he unfortunately never made. He was lured into an alleyway probably on the promise of money for helping the box man with whatever the hell was in that box. 



Passersby head laughing and ran to the source of the noise. The scene that met them was one of complete depravity. The box man had raped the young man and proceeded to stab him over and over again. Chris had over 150 stab wounds on his face, neck and torso. His genitals and anus completely mutilated by the box mans knife. The box man was sitting next to the boy laughing maniacally while licking blood off of his own fingers. 



He was sent to Carstairs without limit of time. He would die there at the hands of another psychopath. He was strangled and had his eyes gouged out.



Ironic really, as they never found young Chris's eyes.

Obligatory "this didn't happen today, but it did just recently happen"



Short....well, it happened. I was eating my wife out in our dark bedroom, when I realized something didn't feel right with my front tooth [I have vinears up front]....ran my toung across my front teeth when I realized one of them cracked in half and I was missing the other half. SHIT!



So, I tried to inconspicuously look for it while continuing to do my husbandly deed down there without killing the mood, but couldn't locate it and had to turn the lights on and look for it because my fear of it getting lost deep inside her was growing. 



Needless to say, I jacked off that night.

Hello, 

  

Sorry if some things are off in my spelling and grammar im still slightly druged. 



  

I was admin today for acute appendicitis. I under went emergency surgery and have been in recovery for about 8hrs now. 

  

I do not know what my insurance will cover but i have a 4000 deductible 75/25 after that and 10k max.   

  

I only recently started to try to manage my money better, because of that I have 1k in savings, and another in Stocks.  

  

I know this isnt gonna be cheap and will probably have to pay quite a bit. I was just wondering if any of you have any tips for dealing with hospital bills and what is a good way to deal with them. 



  

If anyone has any info on what i can expect or has been through this, it would be very much appreciated. I have never had to deal with something like this and am a bit worried.



  

Thank you.

When I was preparing for college, I wasn't sure where I was going to go. I'm a bright kid and had a few options. By the time I decided on the University of Alabama (Roll Tide), I had already missed the deadlines for applying for honors housing. I was really nervous about coming to college (I'm not your stereotypical college kid), but I met some guys on FB that seemed really cool. I was pumped to have everything set in stone.



This is where I messed up: I got an email from a guy living in the best honors dorm on campus, asking me to switch dorms with him, because he had a lot of friends in my building. I said no. Because I was excited to already have "good" roommates.



The first night there while I was weeping like Luke Skywalker with his hand chopped off, my roommates ate my entire box of peanut butter ritz bits. That's when I knew that things were not gonna be ok...



Cut to cocaine, "home-made" alcohol, theft, knife fights, "krispy kreme wars" (which I was down with), sizzurps, and doing awful things to black girls... I was not in a great situation.



I spent most of my nights locked up in my room trying not to hear what was going on. And where I come from, snitches only snitch once... then they go to the dentist for some new teeth. I was trapped in a cage with a rancor on her period



My roommates really wanted me to participate with them / pay for drugs, but I really wasn't about that. So, in the middle of the night when they wanted attention, they would just pound on my door for an hour or two.



One night, the pounding ended earlier than normal. I thought I might actually get some sleep. And then I heard in a chorus of sickly-sweet hoarse whispers "(my name), we're gonna rape you.... we're gonna raaaaaape you..."



At this time, I would encourage you to say with me out loud: "we're gonna raaaaape you" in the creepiest voice possible. Please don't do this around other people.



It is oddly satisfying to say...



So many other stories about this crew, but it's time for football (Roll Tide).



Moral of the story: don't do drugs, kids.





TL;DR: "We're gonna raaaaaaape you"

I thought that the first season (pt1) was pretty lacking in quality and was somewhat boring at times and the humor just was very citcom-esque. 



I decided to give season 2 (pt2) a chance, and *wow* the show did a full 180 and is much more enjoyable that pt 1.

I am a teenager who grew up in a Christian home, but is questioning her faith. Music opens up a philosophical part of me, especially if the lyrics are deep. I need songs in the genres of alt rock, alt pop, indie rock and indie pop that are about spirituality and questioning it, because I'm in some sort of mode right now.



P.S. I do know there is a another subreddit where I could post this, but this is more populated, and this mind a lot lately, so I just want to ask more people.



edit: I have made a playlist on youtube of all the song reccs from here and r/popheads (I posted the same question there) any songs I like will probably be made into a Spotify playlist but IDK yet.

I've gone saving crazy and I want to max out my retirement so that I can have a chance of being a well-off old turd in the future.  I get a defined contribution from my employer into a 401k (so no matching, but they put money in every week).  The options at work are good, but the options at Schwab are even better.  Can I have two 401k accounts and can i get the tax deferment on both?  I asked google and looked at the Schwab page...but I cannot get a clear answer to this.  Thanks in advance.

She works a job and lives with her boyfriend's family but pays his parents each month to live there. She pays for everything herself, is 18, and has no support from anyone else whatsoever. I'm not sure how to go about proving to FAFSA that she is completely independent.

The conclusion was, that everybody only acts in his personal interest. Humans teach each other the goal is to gather and control as many resources as possible. Maybe it could be called "ego" is the problem ? However, I have not yet figured out why evolution came out this way. Why did evolution not lead to humans that act with the global well-being, including nature, in mind. I believe that this could accelerate the development of mankind much more.





We would not have the financial industry that produces nothing and only drains resources, pharma would not try to sell useless medicine and hide side effects, there would be no companies trying to make money by cutting down the rainforest or overfishing the oceans and risking mass extinction. There would also be no debt and interest based money system which benefits only a few and we would not need to waste resources on military and wars.

I was hired as a trainee and am up for my review this week. After being in the organisation for a couple of months, I now know that I am being underpaid given my qualifications and responsibilities. How do I bring up the fact that I would like them to reconsider my wage? I have never negotiated salaries before.

Doc asks the guy "what happens in these bad dreams?" 



The guy says "Sometimes I'm a teepee, then I'm a wigwam, then a teepee, then a wigwam, teepee, wigwam, teepee, wigwam. It's all night! I can't take it!" 



Doc says "you've got to calm down. You're too tense."

Hi /r/gaming - long time lurker, first time poster.

I'm nearing the end of a lengthy postgraduate university course, having gone a number of years telling myself not to upgrade from the humble playstation 3 (mostly due to fear of losing all academic productivity).



The joyous moment of regaining some guilt-free gaming time has arrived, and I'm rather tempted to rush out and remind myself of how rubbish I happen to be at first person shooters. 



However I'm equally horrified by purchasing a PS4 now, only to have the newest iteration announced/released inside the next 6-12 months.



Could someone of with a more detailed understanding of the current market please help out an individual who's in "the night before christmas" mode over here.

A family friend has offered me the opportunity to buy a house that she owns. She is asking for $35,000 the property is worth approximately $80,000. I have $55,000 in my 401k that is fully vested and about $6,000 in cash. My credit score is 780+. I'd like to take a loan for the entire $35,000. The house is in move in condition, I'd use it as an investment property. I do not currently own a home.

Detective Jones. Detective Daniel Jones. Quite an interesting name for a man who just started his career. Myself stuck with this name now and to begin work in the morning; my life will never be the same again. I've always wanted to become a detective in this cruel but beautiful world. My gorgeous fiancé was out tonight. Out with her annoying, arrogant friends whom I distrust from their back-stabbing last month. Natalie Narrow, the caring women who would soon become Mrs. Jones was out partying whilst I ate away at my microwave meal. Not that it bothered me, its just it seems that she can easily forgive those who do her wrong. Especially her best friend Brooke; the two faced bitch who manipulated my lovely Natalie so well. Slowly, I eat away at the food she left me. My dark, oak brown eyes remained fixed on the horror movie I was currently watching. Halloween wasn't far away and I was excited. Though the excitement seems to go as Halloween wasn't a pleasant time for detectives. Psychotic locals would tend to use Halloween to their advantage and honestly-I was bricking it myself. I was starting my job tomorrow and I had this great concern that something bad would happen this year. Maybe it was just paranoia but this city tended to bounce off these vibes. 



Matarck, the city of devilish personalities and bitter secrets. In some way we had some technology (television etc) but we were still in a slight Victorian time era. "shit!" I say rather loudly as a bit of hot gravy falls out of my mouth and onto my chin. My food was very hot and I could tell from the steam that came of it. My recent, foul language I just released from my mouth made me remember my disgusting attitude to a passing, young women earlier today. She must have been in her early twenties, for she didn't walk like a lady should. She seemed in a rush as she pushed past me, myself of course was annoyed by this as I was carrying some shopping. Natalie never did the shopping, she was always too busy with Brooke. I had spoken my foul language (shit, which again I am very sorry to say) The young, women seemed fearful as both our eyes met. Hers was darker than mine, her hair though was a lighter shade of brown as my hand grabbed it from the collision. I had pulled her towards me and in a moment of seconds the panicking, women kneed me in the balls and carried on running. Such pain as I couldn't run after her, I didn't bother to question why she was so scared but anyhow I was here now and whatever she was running from was not my concern(or still I wasn't aware of the future that would soon be my present) I giggle "idiotic women" as myself looked almost the same age but I was in my mid-twenties. I was twenty-five years old and engaged.



~***~(Raven)



Isolated I was from freedom. I had managed to get away today though that stranger had risked my chances. My heart rate increases as the skies darken once again. Silent was the night and the streets were empty; though at random times you could hear the occasional drunkard. My head was spinning from the shouting earlier in the day when I experienced some verbal abuse from a market trader. It wasn't reasonable to talk to a fragile women like that even if I was running like a nutter. If only they knew I was running for my life and trying to escape the man that forged the bruises on my skin. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I speak slowly "I have no where to go~" I continue to cry as it comes to me that I'm homeless. The toxic argument I had with my boyfriend Albert was frightening but now it began to be my biggest regret. But now I had nothing. My family would never believe me and no one else would want me as a burden. 



Return I must to the violent man, the one who grew my Goosebumps as I stand carefully and release a longing sigh. I frown "Return I must to thy monstrous love" I make my way carefully back to his horrible mansion. His reputation and power hit me as I realised he was all I had in this painful life. The truth revealed itself... I would at each moment beest Albert's

I recently had my first soup dumpling today out of curiosity. (saw a lot of people try it and it looks and sounds delicious).



When I had it the soup was semi congealed and had floaty slimy bits in it. I assumed the soup would be clear. Was that normal for a soup dumpling? Or did that restaurant just make it their own special way?



I didn't really like the texture of the soup that's why I'm asking. If it was a thinner soupier soup (if that makes sense), I feel I would have liked it more, that's why I'm asking. 



PS. The dumpling and vinegar part was amazing.

It seems like every month I have to go through some new bullshit to get my birth control prescription.  I was having it filled at a CVS for over a year and almost every time I needed a new one I had to go fight them for it.  My old prescription had run out and they hadn't applied my new prescription.  I had been removed from the monthly refill service "accidentally" or, my favorite, "at the request of the patient" (absafuckinglutely not true).  



This month, I found out the pharmacy won't give me a refill, despite the fact that I still have 5 or 6 months left on my prescription, because it's been over a year since my last physical.  I didn't know this would be a problem and didn't plan for it.  I can't get in to see a doctor until next Tuesday, I need the medication tomorrow, and even with an appointment on file they won't give me a one month extension.  As if taking my blood pressure is some kind of immediate medical emergency and one extra month of birth control will kill me.  As if this is actually real liability for them.



So I asked if the pharmacist on staff could renew my prescription for me.  I've never tried this before, but the law allowing pharmacists to prescribe birth control went into effect here in California on January 1, 2014.  I figure it shouldn't be that difficult to find a pharmacy that provides this service.  No dice.  No one on staff, or in fact in the entire Rite Aide chain, can provide a birth control prescription.  I called Wallgreens and CVS also, and got a similar answer.  Unlike Rite Aide they do say that their companies are "developing a procedure" for this, but they have yet to roll it out.  I looked it up online and found [this article](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/26/478878991/its-still-hard-to-get-birth-control-pills-in-california-without-a-prescription) from May of this year.  How the hell has this not been taken care of before now?  It's been almost *three years* since the law was passed!



I guess this a vent post.  I'm a married woman. My husband and I have been together for 11 years, married for 6, and we've only ever slept with each other.  I don't have any STDs or any risk of catching STDs.  More specifically, I do not have and have no risk of contracting HPV which is the cause of over 90% of cervical cancer cases.  I do not need unnecessary and invasive medical screening, I just don't want to get pregnant at this time in my life.  And I know that some women don't care about the women's wellness exam crap, and that's fine.  You do you.  But I find it uncomfortable, I'm not a fan of the inconvenience, and I don't need it every damn year (I'm not an unreasonable person, I do plan on getting checked every five years as current medical research suggests).  I have an appointment with Planned Parenthood on Tuesday, but I guess it'll be condoms and fun mood swings for me this month.    



**TL;DR** Still can't get a pharmacist to prescribe me birth control, despite the fact that that has been legal in my state for almost 3 years.  Very inconvenient.  More than a little frustrating.

The last text I got from a friend was his account number. He needs 1000 baht which i guess is around $20-$30. I've never wired money before, but when I tried to do it on Chase, it says I need his address. Unfortunately, I think my friend needs the money to pay off his wireless bill because he's not texting me back his address. Is there a way to wire money without his address?

My company does not allow opening a retirement account until 2000 hours of service.  I moved my funds from my last companies 401k into a vanguard account. I am currently putting in post tax money but I feel like that is not ideal as I'm not letting it grow as fast.  Any recommendations?  Should I/Can I open up a Roth account?



Thanks!

I noticed that no one seems to have mentioned the (Carnegie medal winning 1996) YA book 'Junk' by Melvin Burgess, and was really surprised as it is possibly the most haunting and engrossing book that I read as a young teenager. 



Set in/around Bristol UK during the 1980s, against a punk culture backdrop, it tells the stories of a small group of young teenagers who get caught up taking heroin as runaways. It absolutely blew me away when I first read it at 13 - the accessible writing style, the heart breaking subject matter and characters that will always remain with me. 



Least of all, aiming such brutal subject matter at children I always though to be very daring. I remember the book being passed around secretly when I was 11 or 12 by other kids as parents were often put off by the front cover (featuring a syringe). Burgess grants his younger audience great respect by not sugar coating or sheltering them from the brutal realities of the subject matter, and I remember really appreciating that as a child.



I was wondering if anyone else has read this book, and whether it was more a British thing? What did you think of it?

...if I should learn Russian, Chinese, Arabic or Spanish



Because we will probably have a war against Russia and lose, or get economically crushed by China, or get sold out to the Arabs, or get overran by Mexicans.

I'm wanting to take out a personal loan for a much-needed vacation but have no idea where to start looking or what to look for.  I'm looking for in the range around 10k, but I'll take what I can get.  Any advice?

        

          

Edit: Ok seeing as all immediate responses are not to get a personal loan, let me please please ask that you put that aside for one moment and give me advice on how to go about getting a personal loan, not whether I should.



Edit: And to give some more details, my income-to-debt ratio is actually very good right now, tho my credit's in the low 600s I believe.  I'm a long-haul truck driver and been saving for this trip for a while, but an emergency arose which depleted much of it.  I don't want to reschedule tho as family and friends are all on board, so looking into this.

This fucked up was happened last month, but it is a lesson for any of you who also uses Uber.



Last month, Uber had a promotion which gives you 30 free trips which worth RM5 each. (Yeah, I'm a Malaysian) I entered the promo code and decided to spend them to a supermarket located about 20 km away from home.



With 30 free trips like this, I think of a smart way to save some money:



> Assume travelling for 5 km costs RM 10, I can let the driver to drop me at somewhere near 2.5 km then didn't pay anything, since 2.5 km trip costs only RM 5 and the RM 5 Promo can cover me up. Next, I can have another driver to drive me to the 10 km destination and still didn't pay a cent.



With this method, in theory, I can go to that 20 km place by spending all my promo codes without paying anything. It works out perfectly, for the 40 km round trip, I only spent around RM 4. (One driver drove me to somewhere else...)



Only if I wasn't that **lazy**.



On the way back, I told a driver about my plan. He agreed, that he will accept all my forthcoming trips all the way back to my house. I told him to stop me before the RM 5 fare mark, plan my next under RM 5 trip, have him to select me as passenger, repeat the process until I get home.



After a week, my Uber app logged me out. I tried to log in again and it say that my account is disabled. I e-mailed Uber support and they say their system detected that I am riding with same driver multiple times and banned my account.



Sorry for my bad grammar.



**TL;DR** I tried to be smart on using promo code by splitting trips into multiple smaller ones, had same driver to fetch me home because too lazy to wait for next driver, and got the account banned.

I'm standing there in the game panicking and it's only a video game. And they did this stuff for real? Balls of steel doesn't even do the soldiers justice.



It was hell on earth and they were right in the middle of it. You see your friends die right in front of you and just sort of have to get on with it. You're constantly one bullet or explosion away from death. It's chaos. You've got bullets flying in all directions, screaming from those dying or those giving orders or both and you're expected to shoot the enemy? You just sort of shoot in the direction you reckon the enemy's bullets are coming from and hope. And this was the early 20th Century, before all the technology the current soldiers have (whom I also respect).



To all those that fought in World War 1, I tip my cap to you and may you rest in peace.

as we all know a wormhole is some sort of a theoretical portal that leads to another place in space. So if we ask what's inside a wormhole the answer is simply space, which contains the wormhole.

I know this is a question asked often here. But after searching, I couldn't find a solid answer for my specific situation.



I'm 19, taking full time classes and working 30-40 hours a week. My  wife does the same and we both share our truck to get to work, school, ect. We want to sell the truck to buy a car and save money on commuting. We have $5000 in savings (however, we can't go below $3500 without being charged with a bank fee) and plan on getting $8,000 from the truck. I also plan on spending $4000-$6000 on the car.



Our problem is, everyday we need transportation for work and school. So selling the truck and having a week without a vehicle wouldn't work. I can't get a rental since I'm 19, and I really want to sell/buy privately to get a better deal. Is there anyway I can go through this process of selling and buying a car without losing transportation for an unknown period of time? Thanks for the help.

It seems like if you ask someone to hum or play a blues riff most people seem to perform this riff even if they have no idea of the song or have never listened to blues music. So I was just wondering if there is another blues riff that is more famous or well recognized?

Red things happened. There was a red and angry flood. It consumed the entire world. It engulfed my home, my family, my friends. And then it swallowed everything that made me human.



After I woke up, seven letters have been floating around in my mind.



Seven. Seven letters that keep drifting closer together, seven letters I keep pulling apart. The number has never been lucky for me—it reminds me too much of Sunday school; seven woes to the scribes, seven years of captivity, seven wraths of Heaven, seven things the Lord hates. The number of the beast is six-six-six, and six can never be seven, just like “all who have sinned fall short of the glory of God”. Seven.



It’s been seven days since I last saw *him.* Or maybe it’s been six.



I’m sorry. All of that religious stuff is something I got from my upbringing. I still remember all of it, even though I’ve tried to forget; I actually find those ideas and implications rather unnerving. But it’s just something that, once it’s in, can’t easily be ignored. Like the dream. Only I’m worried that the dream wasn’t just a dream, that it came from somewhere else entirely. Well, not so much somewhere, but *someone;* a someone I thought I could keep all to myself.



I made a mistake. I know I’m stupid for it. But I want to say all this here because, at this moment, reaching out seems more important than anything else. I feel unreal, I feel filthy, I feel violated. I’ve never been in this situation—I don’t know of anyone on Earth who has—and the implications of it left me on the bathroom floor, holding my knees against my chest, with those seven letters pressed against my consciousness.



I suppose I just want to do something that can affirm my humanity. Something to distract me from ... Yes. I think that’s what counts now.



And, after all, the dream in itself doesn’t matter; what matters is what the dream reveals about the dreamer.



Here goes.



My name is Claret Sommers. I’m eighteen. I’d be the last person suspected of getting caught up in the mess I’m in.



I was born into an old-fashioned Catholic family, raised by the Book, nurtured by The Love. I was a good girl. I was even part of the Chastity group at church, with plans to be the youth leader. I used to be content—blissfully, ignorantly so.



See, my family has always been impoverished, poor as is possible in this day and country, taking food and clothing donations from the church whenever it was available. The only thing that really held us together was religion; a unified understanding and carrying out of rules. No bad influences. No taking risks. Men go to work and pay bills. Women do housework and have kids. My mother never had a job, and my father paid for everything. But my parents had high hopes for me, ‘high hopes’ in the sense that they wanted me to do well as long as I stayed inside that protective shell of order.



But it’s from within that cover that I saw a light, a light that guided me. A light that led to him. A light that led to ...



*(Seven letters)*



No. Stop.



The first time I caught a moth—that’s what sparked this. We always had one or two around, either from our stored grains or from our hand-me-down clothing, but that year dozens of them infested. It got pretty ridiculous. They’d show up in every room with light; the living room, the washroom, even the dining room where we’d eat. The one I captured, though, turned out to be special.



It was in my room, resting on the light-bulb. As it stretched its wings, it casted its expanded shadow over me while I was trying to read; I think it was Dancing With Demons: The Music’s Real Master.



Usually, I’d be too afraid to touch them, and I’d always ask my dad to take them outside—gently; I didn’t want them to be hurt. But I’d grown so irritated by their frequent appearances that I just went to remove it myself.



I managed to carefully cup it into my hands, and then brought it over to an open window. It wasn’t as creepy-crawly as I imagined it would be, in fact, its fluttering against my palms felt pleasant. When I tossed it out, however, I was instantly filled with regret. I watched it twirl downwards, helpless, disoriented, flapping its tiny wings futilely as it fell all the way down and then disappeared into the dark. With a sharp pang of guilt, a realization occurred to me: I had crushed its wings.



From then on, the memory of that moth has stayed with me for two reasons. The first is that I felt so bad I cried over it a number of times; the second is that it gave me perspective.



Everything was set out for me; school, church, prayer, school, church, prayer—repeat, repeat, repeat, on and on, find a man, get married, have kids, fulfill some kind of ‘grand design’. There wasn’t any room to *breathe.* And whether my parents had meant it to or not, that rigid, utterly sheltered lifestyle they insisted I live only became more and more of an enclosure. The tighter it got, the more I noticed light between the cracks.



I wanted out. I wanted out of structure, I wanted out of roles, I wanted out of inevitability. I was tired of God and Jesus, tired of Kings and Masters, tired of boring Christian men and boring Christian women. I wanted anything that was the exact opposite of all that; anything that didn’t simply reaffirm my beliefs—my *parents’* beliefs. And the only things that could get me close to something like that, without labeling me entirely blasphemous, were books.



And I knew just where to get those kinds of books.



Every year, before October, my church organizes an event in late September called a Harvest Festival. It’s supposed to be fore celebrating autumn. But, as a sort of protest of Halloween (which we don’t celebrate), my youth leaders literally buy truckloads of ‘satanic’ novels from local bookstores—just so we can all burn them in a big bonfire. I’m not joking. They give prizes for throwing the most in.



So this year, now that I’m technically an adult, I decided to do some more ‘adult’ things and take control of my own destiny. So I used the Harvest Festival as an opportunity to get my hands on my first ever forbidden book: ’Salem’s Lot. I kept it tucked under my sweater the entire time, even as we all sat around the fire while my peers obliviously feasting on marshmallows and hotdogs cooked over the ashes of dying literature. I remember sitting there, staring into the fire, poker-faced, so worried they’d find out that I was afraid to move or talk. I didn’t even realize until later that the heat from the fire tanned my arms.



But, fortunately, no one ever suspected little ol’ me, good little Claret, daughter in a family that practically lived off the good graces of the church.



It was a six-day read. I was just blown away. Blown. I would have read it again, but I had to get rid of it after. If my parents ever found out about a Stephen King novel in my possession, I am dead-serious when I say they would disown me.



I craved more.



Before I buried it, I took a look at what was printed on the price sticker:



&nbsp;



FANFARE BOOKS



92 Ontario St, Stratford, ON



&nbsp;



The next day, I went straight to Fanfare. Ironically, it was right next to the Gospel Lighthouse.



As soon as I walked in there, I was enthralled. Hundreds of beautiful books rested under orange shelf lights with their fantastical covers gleaming loud and bright—flaunting their covers proudly, rebelliously. Fruits of the mind I had never tasted, all out on display, just waiting to be plucked.



I went deeper into the isles, and deeper, and then there it was, in the back, like stepping into a restricted area: the horror section. Lots of horror books. Piles of them. Right there. No sweater-smuggling required.



But I was confused. Considering that I’d still have to keep all this a secret, I felt limited to choosing one. And due to my inexperience, I didn’t know what else was good in horror.



I went and asked the lady who was working the cashier what she recommended. She pointed to back-corner in the store, at a subsection labeled ‘Staff Picks’.



It was a fairly large section, with shelves dedicated to each genre. Horror was on the far right.



I saw ‘Charlotte’: She had selected a bunch of John Saul books that had statues or broken dolls on the covers. I flipped through a few pages. Interesting. But not what I was looking for.



I saw ‘Rachel’: She had some decent-looking stuff; sort of mystery-horror, and I even noticed Red Dragon. But I didn’t touch it. Even I knew its reputation of that book. Maybe it would be a bit too much for a novice.



I saw ‘Jessica’: Clive Barker and H.P. Lovecraft. Never heard of them.



I saw ‘Amy’: A bunch of Edgar Allan Poe. I did know of him, but never read. I didn’t care for something quite that old, either.



I saw ‘Sarah’: Chelsea Quinn Yarbro collections. Once again, no idea who. No idea what.



I saw ‘Natalie’: Lots of Stephen King. Well, I liked him last time ...



Then I saw ‘Leon’.



Leon had one book. One book with a gold cover and a gothic-style title printed in pure-black. I’d seen it before, in used bookstores, in libraries, and I remembered a movie even came out for it, starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise—my parents used to turn the television set off whenever it came on. Best of all—it was written by a woman. Not that it terribly mattered, but still; here was a book I was genuinely curious about. It seemed to whisper to me. No—it was screaming at me.



Without hesitation, I grabbed it. I took it to the counter, paid for it, and then held it against my chest as I speed-walked home.



Six-day read.



It was exactly what I needed. Brilliance. It was vivid and passionate and inspired, and it opened me up to completely new concepts of love—of relationships. I was impressed it did that with no sex scenes at all. I’d read *Christian books* with more sex ... but—not as much gore.



And apparently I had this ‘Leon’ to thank for it.



*(Seven red letters, seven horrible, terrifying letters)*



And so it became a little ritual. Over the course of the next few weeks, I’d sneak off to Fanfare and go straight to the staff-picks horror section. Leon never failed me. *Let The Right One In, Lost Souls, Fevre Dream, Those Who Hunt the Night, The Historian, The Moth Diaries*—all of them wicked, lovely things. I’d even check back at Fanfare, before finishing a novel, just to make sure I didn’t miss a new one. I guess I was so excited reading those books that I hadn’t noticed another one only went on his shelf when I finished the previous one.



There were many things I didn’t notice.



One little thing, that’s all it takes. There was something about him I couldn’t get off my mind. I found myself wondering: what if? A pet enigma. Someone I never met, yet I formed a little spot for him in my heart; a perfectly neat chamber awaiting his never-arrival.



But the night I finished The Moth Diaries, the sixth book, I found myself on the phone with him.



“Hello, Claret,” a man’s voice said. It was smooth and emanated out of the earpiece like smoke. I could hear his smile. 



“H-Hello,” I said.



“How do you like the books?”



“Oh, yes. I—” My throat tightened. My shoulders tensed. I sat up and switched the phone to my better ear.



“I chose it especially for you,” he said.



I was silent for a moment. I could feel my pulse in my hands. Eventually, my voice came back, and I said it, I said the name: “Leon.”



“Of course.”



“But—how? How do you know my number?”



Only silence.



“Hey, hello? Leon?”



Then he simply said, “As long as you like it.”



***click!***



It was almost a full minute before I realized he’d hung up. I was just in a daze. And confused. And scared. And, well, a little bit of something else too.



We talked on the phone many times after that. It became more and more natural. I’d never had a boyfriend before, and I was more than a little excited. I could tell he was nothing like any other guy; he was cool and mysterious and powerful, in the very truest sense of those words. And he was new. Talking to him, just the thought of knowing he existed, somehow alleviated the otherwise constant chill I had developed.



Our conversations were usually about the books. He’d ask me what I thought, and I would just pour my heart out. He’d hum and haw, and sometimes laugh, and then offer me insight into things I hadn’t quite picked up on. He was extremely knowledgeable, especially when it came to folklore. And he always sounded so interested. Let me just admit that he made me feel safe, safer than I ever felt. He was somehow just ... this source of incredible warmth.



But the truth is it was something less than love, just some hidden want or need; guilty pleasure. And guilt combined with pleasure is the first ingredient for chaos.



It wasn’t long before I’d wake up in the morning, barely able to sit up. Standing made me dizzy. And I was almost always freezing cold. All I wanted to do was lie down, curl up, and sleep. Sleep every day. I stopped going to classes. I stopped going to church. I stopped talking to people. I didn’t notice my skin growing paler. I didn’t notice the loss of weight. I barely even noticed that thing, outside my window, constantly flitting about and thumping against it. Maybe it’s some kind of bird. But I don’t know any birds that come to windows at night.



Maybe it’s my moth, trying to get back in.



Of course, everyone knew something was wrong. My parents even managed to scrape enough money to buy me this laptop I’ve been wanting as a get-well gift. I’d never seen them so concerned for me. They didn’t even mention anything about the stack of six books I had on my night table. Maybe they were just too worried to care. What I think, though, is that they actually fear them.



We had a doctor here, just last weekend. At the time, I was in and out of sleep, but I do remember he said something about needing to eat—like, *really* needing to eat. Eating and drinking sounded very important. But I was eating. He also said that I need to stop self-harming or they’d send me to a ward. That was odd too; I had never hurt myself before. He kept lifting my head looking closely behind, touching, prodding, asking me what I ‘used’, over and over. I just kept telling him I had no idea what he was talking about.



I want to move, to do something—anything. But my body simply won’t. In this state, accomplishing something small—like a diary—feels like a great achievement. It probably is.



I haven’t been able to reach my phone for a week now. It’s on my dresser. I know he wants to see how I’m doing. I know he’s worried, I know he is. He told me in my red dream.



This morning I tried to go for it. I believe I fainted. That’s when I had my dream.



I woke up to see all my books scattered around me—I must have knocked them over.



But I felt great. I could stand. I could walk. I could see sharper, feel deeper—I could hear my mother tearing open a bag of Quaker from downstairs, I could even smell the spices and oats as she poured them into a bowl.



I was so overcome by elation that I went straight for my phone, to tell Leon of my miraculous recovery.



That’s was when I caught sight of myself in my standing mirror.



My cheeks were concaved. My skin was bone-white. I have black around my eyes that was never there before. And my teeth ... oh God, my *teeth.*



Whether that set off my nerves or something else entirely, I became aware of an itch on the back of my neck.



I pulled my hair away. What I saw sent icy fingertips running up along my back:



The reflection revealed two tiny holes in my skin, about an inch or so apart, rimmed purple.



I screamed. Then I cried. And then those seven letters came. The seven red letters, drenched in blood, tattooed into my mind like it’s the only option I have left.



I have to be honest here. I have to say it like it is.



I’ve already tried. The cuts just close over as soon as I make them.



This is me. My name is Claret Sommers. I’m eighteen. I’ll live forever. 



I wish for death. But even that is denied me now. I have to accept this. I’ve never had much of a choice, did I? It’s the fate people like me to be squeezed into whatever container holds us, chasing secrets and dreams and drawn by bright rays of illusory hope—only to be burned by the cruel heat of our desires.



I didn’t finish describing the rest of the dream:



I came up out of the red water, not myself, and I was lying in an open grave. My mind flared crimson with a red dawn over a blackened forest. The horizon burned with sanguine, the leaves were ignited by rays of orange light. And his hips were pressed strong against mine.

Hey r/gaming, black gamer here. I know the whole BF1 black people drama has been ruining the game for some of you guys. But honestly is it that bad? 



I'm asking a genuine question here, I know the majority of gamers are white males and most gaming companies market towards that (no shame in that, I absolutely agree). But is this whole BF1 thing worth upvoting such blatant thinly veiled racism.



I know it's about historical accuracy and all. However the game was never going to be historically accurate. Focusing on the black soldiers issue seems so monotonous at this point.



When game devs see this they aren't going to worry about historical accuracy, they are going to worry about diversity in gaming not selling and thus stop trying to include that.



I don't know what my point is exactly but I'm trying to say most of the people complaining about this have such obvious racist intentions behind this. And it feels shit because gaming is becoming another thing that I, and most other black gamers, feel like we're being pushed out.



I understand your frustrations but please be more civil when discussing these matters.

I can't understand this game.



I see swarms of different resources: production, food, faith, policy...



And tons of numbers.





All I have to do with all that stuff is constantly click 'Next turn'. 



Some researches are being made, my soldiers pointlessly roam the map and I just hit 'Next turn' until the new research/production is ready, choose production... and then this 'Next turn'-spamming starts over.





What am I doing wrong?





I'm sure that's not the way this game is supposed to be played — but I don't know what else to do.

Have a wank and then straight after think about whether you want to spend time with them.  If not,  it's just a physical attraction or their wealth

This happened earlier today , the first time shaving was not too bad although it was minor razor bumps so I decided to get ultra sensitive woman's shaving gel and a new razor (which was from when I bought it to now , a week old) to avoid the same mistake as the last. So I had pre anticipated on shaving my legs before because they're extremely hairy and whenever I wear pants , the leg hairs get yanked and pulled on so I thought "why not shave my legs?" So I did it. Took me an hour to completely take off all them little fucks but I did. I first started with "Nair" , if you peeps don't know , it's a product cream that you apply on legs and leave for a few minutes then take it off and it takes off some/most of your hair. For me , it took off some so I used a razor and the "ultra sensitive shaving gel" and went ham on my legs and pubic area. I felt great at first. After my warm shower , a few minor scratches nothing to make a big deal about. 6 hours go by to where it's time for bed , I cannot stop scratching these legs. It's insane. I moisturized after my shower , I did my best to avoid itching all day. Right before bed I applied moisturizer all over and around the legs. I get in bed and scratch the hell out of my legs. I look up some treatments and stuff and all these things like witch leaf or aloe Vera or baby oil are things I do not have. I come across a hot compress towel where basically you drench towel in warm water then you apply on where you have the razor bumps for 5-10 minutes. I do exactly that but I have the razor bumps everywhere. As soon as I apply the towel wrapped around my legs , it starts to feel better , until the towel begins getting cold. So there I am panicking thinking this is my last day to live before I scratch my legs to stumps ! I hop in bathroom and give myself a hot ass bath trying to delay my death. I have no ingredients and I do not know what to do or how to fix this. It is currently 3:30 AM and I'm in my tub with an aching, irritating , burning sensation on my legs. If anybody could help I'd be very grateful 



tl:dr I am a fool who has still not mastered the art of shaving and avoiding razor bumps. Am now currently suffering through my mistakes. Me need much help. Help me. Help me now. I help needing now 





Edit 1: it's 7:05 AM and the legs have not stopped itching. I've been in the tub for a while now

Hi guys I just saw the witcher 3 sale on steam and after watching some videos it looks definitely cool enough to be bought.



However what really got me is the dialogs and the story, the gameplay looks meh to me.



So should I buy the base game, or the DLC are packed with story too ?



Or should I buy only of the 2 DLCs ?

If I could describe this book in one word it would be charming (no pun intended).  It is a story of a recently widowed man named Arthur Pepper who finds a charm bracelet that belonged to his wife as he sets out to discover the story behind each charm and the life his wife lived before they were together.  Main themes are love, loss, aging, surprise and fear. It was a terrific book that I could not put down.  It is a very easy read and one of the most uplifting stories I have read in a long time.  Definitely recommended.  "I do not want to forget the past, only to move on from it."

I was trying to remember the name of a game at PAX 2016 that had a weird cartoon art style that was similar to Space Dandy in color (With light pink and blue). It was set in space with a hex grid and you gathered cards to fit your deck which contained your equipment like a ray gun. The monsters only moved and attacked if you moved into a new hex.



The name is escaping me.

Hi, I'm a recent listener of Zedd -- I found him through Porter Robinson, he was just recommended out of nowhere. I really enjoyed the album overall, so I looked further into the production of it...I ended up finding an interview where he clarifies that all the songs of True Colors are themed after their own colors. He also stated that you could feel the colors in the song -- which I tried doing below, other than the colors I found from his interviews.



So after some extensive searching online (and some of my own assumptions after listening), I've come to the following conclusions: 



* **Addicted To a Memory:** Purple (stated by Zedd) 

* **I Want You To Know:** Unsure

* **Beautiful Now:** Magenta (assumption)

* **Transmission:** Grey (assumption) 

* **Done With Love:** Teal (stated by Zedd)

* **True Colors:** Red (assumed by the album cover) 

* **Straight Into The Fire:** Orange (assumption based on title...)

* **Papercut:** Black or White (assumption)

* **Bumblebee:** Yellow (assumption based on title)

* **Daisy:** Soft Green (assumption) 

* **Illusion:** Blue (since it's the only color not yet taken?)



Feel free to add anything you think, or official colors you know about!

I've been posting to this subreddit for a few years now. It began as a way of venting; turning intangible frustrations to fleshy words that might be better digested, creating something I had some measure of control over. 



Like so many stories, mine are inspired by things that happen in the strangeness that is reality. Stories of dopplegangers, and aliens, ghosts, and haunted objects, all spun from threads of truth in my life. Today, I want to do something different. I want to share those real things that have happened to me, that have made me so keen on the creepy, so preoccupied on the paranormal. 



Maybe it'll be a series and maybe not. Either way, I hope you share your own experiences. In this way I hope we find community and kinship in the fact that those strange things that keep us sleepless may not be fiction.



The earliest encounter I can remember happened was when I was five, a scary few weeks in which my mom was acting strangely. My mom is a kind soul, hardworking, and the light of my life. So when she began speaking to us only to berate us, when she started keeping herself in her room, when she stopped cooking and cleaning (two things she finds therapeutic), when she would have fits of bellowing laughter in the middle of the night, my family grew concerned. From what they tell me, we first feared it was something psychological. But nothing the doctor could provide pointed to this, and any time she was brought in she would behave normally. When she stopped going to church, my Dad started having other suspicions, and so called his childhood friend to come and have a look at Mom.



In Filipino culture, we call even unrelated family friends Uncle and Auntie by default. Uncle Carmelo was no exception. He was also the Filipino equivalent of a witch-doctor, which we call "Quack-Doctors." The moment Uncle Carmelo stepped inside the house, he was all business. A smile fading from his lips, his eyes scanning the living room and then, as if seeing through the wall, directly upstairs to the master bedroom where my mom was waiting, he gave us commands. This part I remember vividly. He asked me to get a small sauce pan, my dad to grab a lighter, my brother to go upstairs and wait with my mom, and my sisters to open all the windows in the house. He went to his car and returned with a bundled plant, which today I suspect was sage. Taking the saucepan from me and the lighter from my dad, he set the sage on fire, placed it in the pan so that the flame smoldered, and proceeded in each room of the house muttering under his breath with the small entourage of myself, my dad, and my sisters following closely behind him.  



The next part I only know because my brother and dad recounted it. My sisters and I were not allowed in the master bedroom, where my dad had drawn two chairs between the night stand and placed them in the middle of the room. They described how Uncle Carmelo sat opposite my mom, the smoky-sage pan on the nightstand, how Uncle Carmelo asked my mom questions and how she seemed unreasonably angry at his presence. Then how Uncle Carmelo grabbed my mom's hand and placed the smoldering sage in her palm, how, between the silk curtains of smoke, my mother's face went from painless indifference, to a pained shock. The thing about it is, when the pain came, they say her face changed. Not like she contorted in anger or surprise, but that her face literally changed, that, in the instant of pain, she was not my mom, but was, I later learned, wearing the face of my estranged aunt.



It turns out my mom had made a business with an aunt who lived two hours north. The business went south a few years before, and my aunt blamed everything on my mom. This aunt is so disliked by our family, they won't even name her for me. It turns out, this aunt dabbles in magic from the old country. The best Uncle Carmelo could say was that my mom was possessed by this aunt. He did some cleansing rituals and prayers with her and my mom was back to normal. The whole ordeal left her invigorated for closeness with God, kept our family as near the church community as possible. I can thank my nameless aunt for years of early Sunday mornings spent fighting sleep and boredom in a church pew.



There seems to be a running theme with faces in my family. When I was 11, I had my first existential crisis. It dawned on me, awful and heavily, that I would die one day, that all my family would. I resolved to ask my brother and mom that, if they should pass before me, they make their best effort to tell me that there's "something there." That we don't go black and blank and unknowing. I asked for this while crying in my parents bed, my brother holding me, my mom stroking my face.



What I remember is this: my brother said something to me that finally made me smile, and then we all started laughing, and then, quite suddenly, they weren't laughing anymore. Instead, they looked at me like I was doing something wrong. I remember that so clearly; it was as if they caught me masturbating or lighting a cat on fire. They just stared and stared. I learned later from my brother that, while laughing, my face started to "swirl." I imagine it was something like the whirlpool of a draining bathtub. From what my brother says, from my nose, the rest of my features spiraled so that my eyes were long slits along my cheek and my laughing mouth was somewhere near where my eyebrow should be. It still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. My mom claims not to remember, although I can still see her then, in my minds eye, jumping off the bed, grabbing her Bible, and praying over me.



My brother wasn't always so good to me. I posted a story here before, titled "I can't look my brother in the eyes anymore," where my brother is replaced by a murderous doppleganger. The truthful part in that story is this: when I was seven, and my brother would babysit me, he'd do things just to scare me. Sometimes he'd yell for me from the kitchen and I'd find him on the floor, smeared in ketchup, a knife seemingly stuck inside him (it was under his arm), sometimes he'd just lock me in a dark closet and mock me with spooky laughter, sometimes he'd just stare at me wordless for whole minutes before grabbing me in a choke-hold. One night, he called me calmly from the kitchen and I came downstairs to find him sitting at the table, no ketchup, no knife, but with a book in hand. He told me to stand at the far end of the living room. I did so. Then he told me to hike up the back of my shirt, and I did so. Then he said, "tell me when you feel something."



To put the distance in perspective, I stood 25 feet (~7.5m) away from him. But turned around, shirt up, and 25 feet away, I felt his finger tips run along my back. When I turned around a second after, he was still seated at the kitchen counter, smiling a wicked smile. No way he had run back in time, no way he had used a long stick to scratch at my back. He just sat there with his little book. I found it later. It was this battered paper back about, and this is my seven year old reader's comprehension, witchcraft. If I ask him about it today, he'll still just smile that stupid, wicked smile. I still don't know what he did to me.



I mentioned aliens before. I am fascinated by their possibility. The Drake equation alone should be reason to soundly speculate their existence, but for me, there was never a question about it; at age six, my whole family saw a UFO. It was a black delta, those three bright lights in triangle formation, it was floating above our neighborhood, and we weren't the only ones who saw it. I remember the barbecue aroma in the backyard, that smell of steak sizzling over coals, my dad at the grill, my sisters sitting in the yard a few feet away doing homework. My oldest sister saw it first, yelled for my Dad, pointed skyward, and we all watched as, slowly, the three lights floated against the dark evening for five minutes before shooting away at impossible speed. I remember our neighbors directly behind us, specifically the Mom of their family, yelling, asking us if we were seeing it, how her husband came out to see about the fuss. Then I remember running inside for my mom and brother, and crying my eyes out because I thought "they" (the aliens) were coming for us. I remember how my second oldest sister tried to calm me down when she found me hiding in her room. She said, "Oh yeah, the news said they were just helicopters." 



I'm 27 now and I still remember the fear of abduction. What's funny is that, maybe, I've already been abducted. I was driving home from a party three years ago when I saw it. It wasn't a delta, but a weird blue orb. I was coming down a hill that connects to my street, and in the front yard of the second house on a cul de sac halfway down, a big and bright orb shown, about five feet in circumference, hovering a few feet off the ground. I remember seeing it and immediately being overcome with violent shivers. I was transfixed, operating a moving vehicle, and the next thing I knew, I was at the stop sign at the bottom of the hill. I don't remember tearing my eyes away from the thing. I don't remember stopping the car at the stop sign. All I can recall is the bright blue shine, my awful tremors. In that instant, I wasn't even thinking of UFO's or aliens. My body's natural reaction, instead of wonder or confusion, was cold fear.



And now I remember, about age 14, waking up in the dead of night and hearing a strange sound throughout my house. It was as if my whole house was pulsing. I remember walking from my room to my hallway and feeling as if I definitely shouldn't be up right now. The weirdness of that sound that made the hallway feel as though it was expanding and contracting, and I remember how, and this is uncharacteristic of my family, all the bedroom doors were closed. Usually my older sisters and my parents have their doors open no matter what. My sister insists upon it as my Dad has bad sleep apnea and she likes to keep an ear out for when he goes too long without a breathing snore. She has us all keep our doors open, just in case. But when I woke up to the sound, the feeling, of the house pulsing, the doors were closed, and what's more, looking at my parents bedroom door, it occurred to me that I didn't want to open it. I wouldn't want to find what was inside. And despite the fact that I woke up needing to pee, I seemed to decide against it, turned around, closed my door (which I normally kept open), and, I think, went to sleep.



And, finally, though this is nowhere near my last true scary memory, I remember once, probably that same year, playing Counter-Strike to the early morning. It was a school night and I didn't give a fuck. In those early days of CS addiction, my mom liked to poke in my room to tell me to sleep. This night, I assumed that was what was happening. I remember being severely frustrated about a match on Dust2, where some asshole and I were the last standing. He started shanking the walls, indicating a round ending knife fight, to which I obliged, only to be gunned down by the son of a bitch when I showed up in CT spawn (seriously, it's been 14 years and I still fucking hate this guy). To blow off steam, I went to a surf server and, halfway through the obstacle, I feel a tap on my shoulder. I remember saying, "In a minute mom..." and a few seconds later, a double tap. I didn't turn around until maybe five seconds later, when I fell to my death and re-spawned at the start of the course. I looked around, expecting my mom to be staring at me disapprovingly, perhaps holding a slipper to smack me with, but found no one in the room. I got up to check the hallway and she wasn't there either. I walked to her room and found her and my dad sound asleep. I checked on both of my sisters and they were asleep, too. My brother, at this point, was stationed out of town. I never found out who / what it was.



So I leave you with this; neither I nor my family have a history of mental illness. I am an atheist now, and believe only in scientific reason. I have a bachelors degree from a reputable university and in my spare time study quantum and astrophysics for fun. I am of the opinion that most paranormal experience comes from the evidence of our senses, which are fallible to any number of physiological variables. But I stand here today unable to explain any of what has brought me to a place like this, telling scary stories to help bring some sense out of what has happened to me. I don't ask that you believe me. All I ask is that you share your scary memories with me.

I have been reading through posts. However, what my husband and I have seems a bit different than the typical "just graduated, making money, have loans", because we moved to a different country.



He had approx 20K in loans, and just put a lump sum of 14K down (we kept 4K for emergencies). His interest rate is 4.5%. He currently has to pay interest on his loans. I have 44K in student loans, but interest doesn't start for me until August 31st, 2017 (since I'm technically still a student), and for the first 6 months after that my interest is reduced to just 2.5%. 





*After taxes, every month I make $2350, and he makes $3350.



*Total income after taxes: $5694



*Monthly non-negotiable expenses:



*Rent: $1119



*Commuter train tickets: $410



*Cell phone: $30



*Groceries: $1000 (we live in a very expensive country now, but even this is being extra generous).



*His haircut: $50



*My waxing: $30



*Eating out: $150





We both get free gym memberships, health care is free, and we both get benefits. If we have kids (which we probably won't do), they'll have free day care, school lunches, and college. 





Should we pay off his loans right away and aggressively? E.g. $2000/month to his loans, and finish paying them off ASAP. Or, should we put just $500/month to his loans, and save $1500/month towards mine to pay a big lump sum all at once.



We'll have some expenses next year, that we have to travel back stateside, so flight tickets are something we have to save for. We don't know many people in the country, so there's no birthday gifts, or whatever. 



How much money should we save for discretionary purposes? How much towards loans? 





Any and all help/advice would really be appreciated!

For example, if you had vast amounts of mass in a large amount of space, the material will collapse in on its own without any help from external energy sources.



Also, stars create massive explosions by just being there lol (nuclear fusion)

Just looking for the specifics on how she should tackle this loan. I don't know all the information and she's being slightly fearful/ignorant about the details so here we go. 



Loan is about $5,000.



Loan has been defaulted.



She's been making regular payments again for a year and a half now.



Interest unknown. 



She does not own any credit cards and has no other debt.



My question is mostly about improving her credit score. Should she pay it off completely all at once? Should she keep making regular payments now to keep a recovering line of credit, (or will having this defaulted loan still active be worse for her credit)? Or (and this might depend on the interest) just pay off most of it and make regular payments for a year or 2 to keep that line of credit going?

2 year old Redwood deck, originally finished with Sikkens that lasted 2 winter seasons and now is in bad shape. 



I'm getting ready to refinish again but my Father thinks that it's a waste of time to use Sikkens again, and said I should just oil finish my deck (he says repeated oiling would not require sanding, which Sikkins obviously does).



I really want a beautiful finish that I can retreat yearly without sanding. But I live in Utah where it snows a lot.



What would you suggest? This is my first redwood deck, and it cost me a bunch of money so I don't want to do anything wrong.

That damn game is so obnoxiously in your face all of the time. I'm wondering is there anything I can do (short of never downloading the game) to make it harder for them? Am I doomed to deal with them until their scum bag ad campaign fucks off?

Protagonist is talked down on, antagonist is portrayed as unbeatable. 

The protagonist finally fights the antagonist after all the suspense. 

Protagonist goes to make the first couple hits, all of a sudden the antagonist is DESTROYING our protagonist. 

Until against all odds the protagonist finds the strength and willpower within them to fight back, (que badass music) protagonist finds a cool way to defeat the antagonist and all of a sudden everyone in the audience is amazed.

Looking to finally begin investing after much anticipation. I am a 22M. 1 year away from graduating in Biochemistry. Debt free. Making $1800 per month. Expenses total out to about $800 per month. Emergency fund made and a few thousand in savings. 



What should my portfolio look like? My goal is more long term investing as I am not in need of immediate or short term money. As I find a more long term job I will obviously look into a 401k with matching options. Should I consider an IRA and bonds now or go for a more high risk strategy in the market? Percentages would help a lot too. (80% stock, 10% bonds, etc)



Thanks, guys!

I've saved all my life, and have not recently gotten the opportunity and an incredible job and make great money. I don't know how long this opportunity will last but I do foresee myself making over $200,000 for the next couple years. Right now I want to buy a home for my wife and myself but I'm not sure how much I should put down what I should invest, how I should invest. Any quick tips for me to get the ball rolling and put some ideas in my head?

What is the perfect "finale" song for you? That is, a song that you think is the absolutely perfect credits song to a really wholesome movie, or the final song in an album which makes you shudder, or the song you are convinced will ring in your ears as you take your last breath?



My shortlist would consist of:



* **[Roy Buchanan - Sweet Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJqHrAvfckg)**. An instrumental blues piece featured as The Departed's credits song. Sorrowful but bittersweet, it sounds like a reflection on difficult times gone by.

* **[Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard - Now We Are Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xButjfhZWVU)**. This song was the theme song of the movie Gladiator. Sung in a "language" made up by Lisa Gerrard, it deals with the feeling of liberation and accomplishment.

* **[Chopin - Nocturne Op.9 No.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGRO05WcNDk)**. A Romantic era piano piece by the prominent composer Chopin. To me it almost feels like it plays out to the universe; a humbling piece of humble piano music. I absolutely love the pause between the first two notes.



What do you think?

The biggest highlight of parenting, has got to be the times where you get to throw out song lyrics at your kids. 

I got to actually say the line to my 7 year old daughter after she only ate her side dishes and asked for dessert. 



HOW CAN YOU HAVE ANY PUDDING IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT? 



...and laughed a good 10 minutes after. The confused look as to why it's so funny is all part of the fun. I'm laughing just writing it. That was some good stuff. I'll be chasing that dragon years to come 😂😆

My wife and I are currently renting [**$1,260 a month - heat & hot water included**] and we're at that stage in life that we want to start looking at houses.  We make pretty good money, and both work for the state.  2015, I brought home a Gross Income of **$67,825** and she took home **$54,323**.  Resulting in our total to **$122,148**.  We recently got pre-approved for **$400K loan**.  Obviously we're looking between the **$200-$350 range**.  We  currently have **$7,000 saved up [$1,000 a month into saving]** and looking to have about **$10,000 to put down.**



Loan Officer, a guy through work, said we should aim for 5%, but 3.5% is where you'll probably end up.  He also suggested going into our 401K if we want to look into that route.  What are the pro's and con's for that?  We don't really even have much to begin with, but I figured if we only take out between 2-4 grand, would that even be an issue? There's usually a 10% fee or something?  We don't plan on having children, these are our careers;job wise, and our goal in life is to have a nice home finally.



More back story:  Been married to my wife 2 years and together for 8.  We both started off with bad credit and shit jobs.  She didn't know how it worked, and I sort of did.  I kept putting off school loans, which at the time didn't think was a big deal, but I'm now paying those off on time, and more than minimum.  That's pretty much the only debt we really have. I think I owe a total of **$17K** on one and **$5K** on the other.  We make an automatic payment of $125 and $52 respectively on each one.  I don't really care if we got to pay that off until I'm dead in the ground.  I fucked up, and it is what it is.  Fast forward to present day, both of our credit is really good.  Especially hers, she never went to college [smart girl], and now understands how credit works.  We pay off the full balance owed on all credit cards, before the due date and we've never been late on payments. This includes car payments as well [$300/$245]



Another thing I might add, which may be weird, is we put all of our bills on a joint account credit card.  It helps me keep track of them all in one place, we get cash back on purchases, and we split the payment [which is normally around $1,000-$1,500] to twice a month before the due date.   I'm the leader on our fiances, which I've pretty much learned on myself by either learning from my mistakes, Google, or friends.



I apologize in advance if these questions have been asked/answered before.  I'm BRAND NEW to the fiance game, and home buying game.  I'll answer any question as best as I can.

How is a fallacious argument, such as an ad hominem or tu quoque, proven to be a fallacy. Is there a simple litmus test, or does it need to be shown in formal logic?

There are things I have seen that I shouldn’t have. Likewise there are things I have done that I had no business doing. The trouble is, I can’t, and won’t, ever know what those moments are. 



The morning after my 12th birthday I found a briefcase in my room behind the door and, like any 12-year-old, I became fascinated by what its contents might be. My parents were not the business type; my mother is a Marine and my step father a security officer, so this brief case was out of place to say the least. I waited until my friends left and went back home before going back to it. The case stayed atop my mind all morning; it was an odd case – hard wood, lightly stained, with a bit of weight to it so I was secretly hoping it was another gift. The locks weren’t memorable, but they existed and were unlocked that day; I know that much. Suffice it to say there was nothing that could keep me from opening that case after my friends left. 



So I did.



And there I was, back at my 12th birthday party. At first this didn’t make any sense to me. I opened the case and according to my memory the contents seem, well, foggy. I don’t really remember the contents at all. This was 16 years ago, but I remember being very puzzled and discussing the case with my parents who had no recollection of it in anyway. They played this up as my imagination, so I thought nothing of it. To be honest, I was 12 and my parents were the closest I could get to an expert. The next few days were like the first time around, with some minor changes, more specifically I didn’t have any friends stay over for my birthday as the overall confusion of the case I claimed to have opened tomorrow didn’t seem like an appealing environment for my parents to allow my friends around. Everything else though, exactly the same; same gifts, same cake, same everything.



My best friend, Steve, was killed in car accident that night



Steve was struck by a drunk driver when returning home on his bike. My parents told me before I went to bed about Steve, I was lost for words but managed to bring back up the case. I felt responsible, had I not opened that case my friends would have stayed at my house, I would have waken up, and Steve would be alive. I know this, because I lived it already. I convinced myself that I could just reopen the case in the morning, no worries. 



So I waited. 



I looked everywhere. Literally everywhere, and I could not find that damn case! Somehow, I got over this and moved on, not sure how but it seems I did. I played this up as my imagination and have convinced myself that my mind is playing tricks on me to make me think I could have done something to change that night and Steve’s future. The fact that everything was the same except for my friends staying over tells me I wasn’t supposed to have Steve stay over. Somehow, that case was a reset button and I needed to open it and go back in order for things to happen the way they are “supposed” to. Fuck that though, Steve was 12 damn years old, what kind of plan is that!



I digress, I have kept this to myself for fear that others would dismiss it like my parents did and I don’t think I can explain to people how or why that case would have appeared in my room that day, and then not again in the repeated events, let alone its existence at all.



I know this sounds crazy, even typing these words out makes me feel like I am sharing a secret that died 16 years ago with that night. The thing is, the case is back, it’s in the corner of my apartment bedroom. Same hard wood, same light stain and the same locks unlocked…

“Fifty Shades of Vomit”



It was a night. Probably a Tuesday night. Brian was watching television, as people with names are sometimes prone to do. Virgins. As nerdy virgin forever-alones are prone to do. His flaccid nerd cheeks sank into the couch as beads of swamp ass dripped into a leather oblivion. Another unproductive night of summer, another ten minutes before jerkin’ it and off to bed.



But wait, suddenly Brian heard the door handle jiggle. Had his roommate come home? Feeling the tingle of mischievousness like the quiet pin pricks before a storm of gout, he launched himself off of his sofa chair and turned off the television. Diving under the pull-out sofa bed in the living room, he hoped to get the drop on his roommate and scare the shit out of his shit-faced shit face. 



Much to Brian’s surprise, the door flung open to giggling and the acrid smell of wet dog. Brian’s roommate had apparently not returned alone from the briny inebriated depths of the local bars, but had caught some fresh tail. Fresh being a relative term, as this particular piece of tail looked bloated from sepsis and thirty-odd years of poor lifestyle choices.



Her face was less than vomit inducing, like if miss piggy had a rat snout and was slathered with five pounds of playdough in lieu of makeup. Brian, already hiding, felt he should wait until they went upstairs to make his strategic escape. Sadly, this they did not do.

 

The roommate began caressing the many folds on the back of her neck while his other hand slid down to her moist cock dungeon. The amorous duo became entangled like shaved chimps trying to escape suffocation inside a wet garbage bag. They knocked over a lamp as they fell down onto the recliner not five feet from Brian’s sofa. 



Consumed by fetid lust, neither of them so much as glanced across the room to see a man’s innocence being destroyed in the reflection of his regretfully open and well-focused eyes. 



Her panties slipped off onto the floor like a wet deflated party balloon that had been blown up too many times. Her ankle folds undulated as her thick pelvis worked its magic behind an obfuscating mountain of flesh. 



She worked her way up and down on his now likely unconscious roommate’s flaccid screaming cock. 



She moaned as he entered her, like a whale singing when another whale hog slams it because it’s too drunk to run or whatever it is whales do when they get down. The smell was overwhelming, like the whole room had been soaked in sweat and a belt sander made of hairy taint was being held against his sinuses. His fingers held his nose like a desperate sailor holding closed the compression hatch on a sinking submarine, but to no avail. 



Her veiny cellulite addled thighs slapped together like two slimy sacks of vacuum packed rice as her head tilted back and her jaw dropped open. The road map of veins on her long wrinkled titties pulsed in ecstasy, beginning the launch sequence of her squirting orgasms. 



Gallons of spooge mixed with taint stink and Elmer’s glue began dripping from her crotch like a bucket of egg yolks, spilling onto the couch. The rancid stink of their demonic ritual now encompassed the room entirely, causing Brian to wretch and vomit. How any human could produce such a volume of fluid was beyond comprehension.



Brian’s brain had long since given up on interpreting what plebeians like us would call “reality”. Brian was currently dancing through a field of daisies and singing with birds but the birds weren’t making normal bird sounds… they were making weird squealing noises… almost like a baby. 



Brian opened his eyes again to see the morbidly obese gal on her back in front of the sofa chair. His roommate was snoring, but that wasn’t the source of the noise. The squealing of a baby could be heard over the whale song of the promiscuous sow. The fat skank had broken her water and been giving birth for the last couple of hours. Brian passed out again.



When he woke up for the last time, the she-beast and his roommate were gone. The floor and sofa looked like a highway accident between a sewage treatment truck and a shipping crate full of rotten chicken parts. What had happened? Did his roommate really bring home a fat skank and let her ride him before blasting out a baby and cheesing it? 



Brian would never find out, because he immediately ran up the stairs to his room and shot himself in the head 6 times with a revolver. He blew out his brains with the first shot, the rest of his body just wanted to make sure.

My father wants me to buy his house from him. I want it. He wants 130,000 and believes it will appraise for more. I talked with a mortgage company and we are planning to do a gift of equity for down payment. I would like to write the contract for more to finish paying off my student loan debt(-13,000), which would technically be a transfer but the interest is half, and would only add 100 or so to mortgage payment instead of the 500 I'm paying a month on them.  Father is more then willing to help me on this.  We're thinking around 153,000. I've crunched all the budget numbers and going from renting with student loan payments vs. mortgage and no student loans, it's roughly the same when estimating all other monthly bills. Am I missing something?

This actually happened today. May be common but I don't think it is. Not many people FU by playing dodgeball. Throwaway in case any of the people at work use Reddit. I doubt it as they go outside. Not taking any chances, mind.



Preface: I'm a teenager, work at a new leisure centre in the area just trying to earn some money to fund my, well, whatever really. I've also played dodgeball for some years so I consider myself not bad.



I help out with the dodgeball on a Saturday morning with two other fellas. It's not bad. Some weeks we have odd numbers, some weeks we have even. This week was an odd week. No problem. As the games go on, I can see one team getting destroyed by the other, which has more players. Being a noble gentlemen, I offer to step in for the short-handed team and try and balance it out a bit. Here's where the FU begins.



The game starts, I hang back a bit and let the kids get on with it. Eventually a loose ball bobbles through to me and I decide to have a crack of the whip. I didn't intend to make anything crack, I promise. I pick up this ball, launch it at what must've been Mach 2 across the court. It's not on target for anyone, thankfully.



Until some kid decides, oh yeh, I can catch this one. Uh no kid, no you definitely can't. He moves straight into the flight-path and then *THWACK!*, shortly followed by *THUD*. Oh shit.



The ball caught him right on the corner of the head and he fell straight to the floor. He didn't move for a few seconds. I thought I'd knocked him out. Then starts the crying. Being a head injury, I obviously have to go get a first-aider to make sure he is okay. No problem. All of the lifeguards are first aid trained. I'll get one of them. I go to reception, ask they send one down, etc etc. 



They didn't send a lifeguard. They sent a supervisor. Great. FU 2.0.



The sup is assessing the little lad and is just trying to talk to him, feel dizzy, tried to catch it, no, yeh, one of those other kids hit you right... 



I turn around and stare straight at the kid. He is staring straight at me. In our small moment together, I can tell straightaway that he is going to end my promising career as dodgeball assistant coach. My dreams of leading England to Dodegball World Cup glory are about to be crushed by a little kid in a green top who has an asteroid-sized lump on his head.



I had a talk with said supervisor and the two other fellas after the session and we all collectively agreed it's probably not good if three experienced blokes are playing dodgeball against kids who we could probably step over. 



Well, damn. At least I didn't kill him, right?



TL;DR: Hit a kid with a dodgeball when I probably shouldn't have been playing dodgeball. Nearly knocked said kid out, won't be playing much dodegball in the near future.

The doctor tells them theres been a mix up and doesn't know who's baby is who's. The English man runs in and grabs the only brown baby and starts to walk out. The Indian man looks relly confused and says "I'm pretty sure that's not your baby it looks Indian so it's mine". The English man says "I know, but there's not a chance in hell I'm leaving here with a baby that could be Welsh."

There was an accident with a power pole in a farm in my country where around 40 cows were killed, and in the news it said that cows killed by electricity as such (or by lightning) are not proper for consumption. I was just wondering, why is that?

Thrive hosted a Spring '16 freebie promotional. It came with an automatic free trial membership, but I canceled that the same day. 



I get the following email **March 30, 2016**



> Before we cancel your account, we’d like to offer a 6-month membership for $29.95 as an alternative. This shortened membership will allow you the same access to savings without having to commit to the full year’s price. This change is already reflected on your account.

However, if you’d prefer not to take advantage of this offer, please reply to this email.



No charges on my account (USAA) or membership, so it was weird when I got another heads up that my membership was again still active. I canceled it and was sent the following email **May 19, 2016**



>Thank you for trying out Thrive Market. We’re sorry to see you go!

I have canceled your free trial membership and you will not be charged.

If you do decide to shop with us again, please note that the nonrefundable membership fee will be charged the day after you place your order.

In the meantime, please feel free to check our site and follow us on social media for updates. We hope you'll consider joining again in the future!



More confusing than perplexing, but okay. Because of these emails I was under the impression I was no longer associated with this business. It wasn't until I was I was hit with a **$29.95 bill** on my card (**June 7, 2016**) that I checked my 50+ spammy promotional emails from them:



**May 22, 2016**



>We hope you're enjoying your free trial, and we can’t wait to welcome you on as a Thrive Market member! As a member, you’ll get a full year to enjoy the world’s best healthy products always up to 50% off retail prices!

On May 26, 2016, you will be charged $29.95 for your annual membership - Welcome to Thrive Market! If you have questions about your membership, please visit our FAQ.



They actually sent me two emails telling me there was a problem charging me! They must has worked it out because they re-joined me **June 6, 2016**:



>Dear Wendy,

Thank you for becoming a Thrive Market member and helping to make healthy living easy and affordable for everyone!



I canceled; I did the whole thing over again.



Today, **October 22, 2016**, they have emailed me again:



>On October 26, 2016, we will renew your annual membership and charge your card $59.95, so you can continue to shop healthy and save big.



Not only have I canceled my account with them multiple times, but USAA has since sent me a new debit card (the other one simply expired). Thrive can't seem to verify my account and transactions by using my email alone, or date of "purchase," and one of the support staff has asked me for the last four digits of my debit card I used. 



Instead of offering emailed support, they now only offer a phone line. That's fine, but I would like to keep archiving all of these conversations so that I have definite proof of cancelling my account. 



**Before I call Thrive, should I contact USAA about this? How can I get Thrive to stop renewing my account permanently?** 



I'm a grad student right now and $25 is no chump change for me. I've since given up hope to ever getting my $29.95 back from June 7th.



Any help would be very appreciated.

My family has a 150 gb per month data plan for 3 people. We often times max out our data shortly before it renews every month. We live in a pretty rural area and we can't get a better connection than our current one. I've been wanting to buy and play the witcher 3, but I'm worried that installing the game and all the updates for the game will take a massive chunk out of our internet. How much data would it cost to install all the updates for either the witcher 3 base game or the ultimate edition on ps4 or xbone, and could I sustain that on my current connection.

Like a lot of Prime members, I preordered Battlefield 1 in plenty of time with the understanding that it would arrive on release date. It didn't, and won't for a little while longer. I did a little research, and discovered that I'm one person among many having the same problem.



Two Chat conversations and a phone call to customer service failed to provide me with an answer as to what's going on. As a matter of fact, none of the CSRs seemed to understand (or at least acknowledge) the crux of the issue: i.e. the discrepancy between the product's expected delivery date and when it would actually arrive. They just kept thanking me for my order and repeating the delivery date.



I didn't want anything more than an acknowledgment and explanation. I'm not out on the hunt for refunds, credit, or anything else. Shit happens, you know? Anyway, I'm just posting this to let anyone else in the same situation know that you're not the only one having the issue and that interacting with customer service will provide neither an explanation nor resolution. Not a complaint: just a fact. 



See you on the Battlefield. Soonish.

The first vinyl release by one of Britain's nascent punk bands, The Damned's debut single "New Rose" lit the touchpaper for one of the most enduring and influential youth culture movements of all time.  



Here's a brilliant analysis from The Guardian of one of the most significant releases in UK pop history:

Not a conspiracy theorist, but there's so much conflicting evidence; does jet fuel burn hot enough to melt steel beams or not? If not, does it burn hot enough to damage large steel beams in such a way that they are no longer capable of upholding a large skyscraper?

This series is hilarious from start to finish.With just the right amount of feels. The plot involves a Government run by Magicians, who use Demons(Djinni) to fight in wars.They also make the djinni do menial tasks like driving cars or assassinating enemies.The main characters are; Bartimaeus,a Djinni,and Nathaniel,the kid who summoned him. The three books involve them; stealing a powerful artifact,fighting a Golem and finally fighting an army of Djinni that have possessed the Government.So basically,a bunch of completely insane plots.It also has a rebel faction that tries to destroy the government and an Afrit(stronger being) that possesses a dead body and runs around causing havoc. The books are set in Britain and told from Bartimaeus' perspective,which gets pretty funny because Bartimaeus has a snide comment on everything and everyone.

So in my signal processing course we are told that an Anti-aliasing filter goes before an ADC. I have a vague idea of what aliasing is. Could someone explain or show what happens with and without this filter before analog to digital conversion? I can't seem to wrap my head around it. I thought preventing aliasing was so that we could get back the original signal, but does an anti-aliasing filter also cause information loss by removing certain frequencies?

The Avengers are all but beaten by Thanos, who has anywhere between most and all of the Stones in the Infinity Gauntlet already. Maybe some of them have even died by his hand, their bodies cradled and mourned. The current leader (Cap, Stark, etc.) says something along the lines of "What else can we do? We're entirely outmatched by him, he's ready to warp reality itself, and no one is coming to help us."



Suddenly, a familiar voice. "Sounds like you guys need some backup."



Camera turns, and we see Fury standing side-by side with Coulson, looking quite well. Behind them, we have Coulson's team and The Defenders, already suited up and acquainted with one another, cracking knuckles and posing for the hero shot with the triumphant music in the background.



Then in Pt. 2, after Thanos loses the Gauntlet but while he does the cliched "I'm still powerful enough to kill you all" speech, his head just fucking explodes and we cut to The Punisher chambering another round with a grin on his face. (Far less likely, but I'd laugh my ass off.)

The only game that i have never beaten was a game called Towers: Lord Banif's revenge.  

Ive tried looking up walkthroughs just to know where i went wrong and figure out how the game ends but I've never been able to even find a reference or review of the game.  

Towers was a game boy colour game,  but i recieved it as a loot bag gift whwn i was young from a kid who's father worked in videogame technology.  

Was this a prototype game and unfinished+undistributed? 

Can someone show me how it ends?

So I've been looking at stocks for a long time contemplating whether to fork out the money to make the initial investment. As I did my research I came across an article that claimed that stocke weren't something that a guy like me should do because they didn't grow too much in the long run. Is this true? Should I invest? How much could the payout be?

With Skyrim Remastered coming out, I was talking with a friend about the things we thought were cool about Skyrim the first time around that we can't wait to do again. We both mentioned things the other never experienced before, like finding the headless horseman. What do you think is absolutely essential to do when playing through the game?

Everyone in our family shares my father's TV provider to catch up any content we miss the other day. One time I was trying to login to it and for some reason, the password didn't work.



So then, I made my father upset.....by changing the password of our TV provider.



Little did I know that the email used for our TV provider is also used for our bank account.



Today, my father found out that "somebody" hacked into his email. He then angrily scolded at me for doing so. I told my father why I changed it. He then told me he changed the password in the first place with one little change to it,l. He didn't explain that to me before I did it.



After scolding at me, he then told me that "everybody in our family fucks up all the time." After resolving with the bank and other services, we went out to lunch together. No harsh punishment here. (Unless I did it again, I'll pledge not to, and I will suffer the consequences)



Lesson learned: Ask before you change. Don't fuck up your family's lives like I just did.

(This is a long one boys and girls)



So I'll get the mandatory "This was not today" part out of the way. This was about two months ago and took place over a series of weeks, each one shittier than the last.



I don't like going out of my comfort zone, bad things always happen. I once landed a lead role in a musical production of Chicago. I had an asthma attack on stage on the first night. See my point? Being outgoing sucks big fat hairy fucking chimp balls.



So it's no surprise I really didn't want to go to South America for my friend's pre-wedding holiday. But noooooo says my therapist, it'll be good for you. Get out there, breath in some of that heavily corn scented air and get balls deep in some sweet brown sugar.



She didn't say either of those things, but I wasn't listening so who the fuck knows.



I eventually gave into the peer pressure and agreed. Took me about two days to pack, I don't normally travel so I wasn't prepared for this. I had to pay for a passport too, which fucked me off right from the start.



Now, I didn't know Mexico had such a massive aversion to fruit. I get that they have a lot of it, but I lack even the most superficial agriculture knowledge so I wasn't really thinking when I packed some apples. I like apples, mostly because apparently eating one a day makes your jizz taste like fruit, which my girlfriend is fine with.



That was a joke, I don't have a girlfriend. Nor have I tested the taste of my jizz.



But long story short, Mexican customs found my apples and freaked the fuck out. They confiscated the rest of my shit under the impression it may have been contaminated by fruit flies or something. They seemed to realise, however, that I was not physically or mentally durable enough to be a real threat to the country. So they let my go on with my friends, *minus my stuff*. They said I'd get it back on my way home.



My friends consoled me by saying I'd totally get some more clothes in Mexico. I was imagining a poncho or something. It didn't happen. Just another way the universe has disappointed me.



Our first location was Cabo San Lucas, which is a nice place. It's pretty small though, and I couldn't find anywhere that sold clothes because no one bothered to learn fucking Spanish. I ended up going to a market on the beach that sold a random array of things.



So now my wardrobe consisted of my airplane clothes, a triple XL orange tradesman shirt, several pairs of extravagantly coloured elastic "booty shorts" which I thought were boxers, and a wafer thin singlet that said *sport* in Curlz font.



And off we went, five rapscallions in a place that almost unanimously hates us. I rocked my Curlz singlet and booty shorts for the rest of Cabo San Lucas, but decided to switch to my unbelievably large fluorescent orange shirt once we mosied on down into Guatemala.



Has any here ever been to Guatemala? Very pretty. Impossible to take in though, because it's so fucking hot that my balls felt like they'd distended about eight inches and were rolling freely around my floral shorts.



So we went to a bar for some drinks, and some "pussy" as my less eloquent friend pointed out. No vagina for me though, I was too busy trying to shake the fucking mosquitoes out of my shirt. They were entering through my massive sleeves, and the shirt was so large they could float freely underneath it. A few girls laughed at this, so I was like "Sweet, pity sex."



Turns out they were prostitutes. Some skinny Guatemalan dude walked up a few minutes later and was like "Hey, my girls would like to spend some time with you." I didn't want to get syphilis so I was unwilling to have sex with them, but I also didn't want to piss off a man with veiny temples. You know someone is not to be fucked with if they have veiny temples.



So I just sat at a table with these girls and bought them drinks. They didn't speak any english, so it was mostly just them talking to each other while I waited for the clock to tick over. I then shook their hands and paid the pimp, who found the whole situation very amusing.



About a week passes, and at this point we're well into South America. We ended up taking a little crop duster looking plane into Peru, because we wanted to see Machu Picchu.



My friends had to go without me though, BECAUSE I WAS BITTEN BY ONE OF THE MOST VENOMOUS SPIDERS IN SOUTHERN FUCKING AMERICA.



The Brazilian Wandering Spider. Waltzed right in to our hotel and bit me on the thigh, I woke up immediately and sprinted out the room screaming appropriately. This shit must have happened a lot, because the old lady in charge practically had the antivenom in her back pocket. 



So thankfully I didn't die, but I did spend the following two days in bed paler than the royal family's cock meat.



But I wouldn't let this stop me from seeing Macchu Picchu, even if my friends had fucked off without me. I waited for them to come back, then announced I'd be going with another tourist party.



However, I wasn't aware that the walk to Macchu Picchu from where we were staying was about 9 fucking hours. So by the time we got to the peak across from the ruins, I was crying harder than the first time I watched Forrest Gump.



Not from the view though, because guess what? A fog front had moved in that day. No ruins, no trees. Nothing. Just gray, like my fucking life.



We waited for hours and it didn't let up, so we eventually headed back. When we got back to the hotel I looked up a few pictures of Macchu Picchu on my phone in pathetic compensation, then had probably one of the saddest masturbation sessions of my life.



Another week passed, and we were set to head home. Mexican customs had sent my luggage back home, so at least I was travelling light.



But, good reader, my unfortunate tale didn't end so peacefully. As I was walking along the tarmac to the plane, a thin shard of glass slide right through the rubber of my sandal and into the sole of my foot. I had to be taken to the infirmary, and consequently missed my flight. The next one was four hours from then.



You'd think that a guy with crutches and a poorly bandaged foot would have a seat to himself, but I ended up sat between possibly the largest Hispanic man I'd ever seen, and the most pungently odoured child on the planet.



This man was at least 350 pounds, and didn't seem to even know I was sat next to him. And the kid, Christ the kid. She smelled roughly how I imagine a yeast infection on a homeless woman who just shat herself smells.



God knows how long I spent in that hell, so once I finally got home I was looking forward to some much deserved peace and comfort.



But nah, my foot turned out to be horribly infected. Spent the next few days in hospital, almost lost the foot.



Now I'm home, and guess what? I'm not going to the wedding. Fuck him.



TL;DR Went to South America, lost my luggage, accidentally cross dressed, gave all my money to a pimp, almost died from a spider bite, DIDN'T see Macchu Picchu, and then suffered a massive infection.

The report screen doesn't do enough to explain what happens most the time. And it's frustrating seeing habitual trollers and AFKers days in a row be unpunished for their offenses. I've resorted to using report bug for the exreme ones (2 players jumping up and down top of midlane, refusing to surrender while trolling). This shits absurd and it's the same player 3 days in a row now. There's no option for that beyond "intentionally sabotaged" which hardly comes close when it includes that, refusing to play, feeding enemy, and abusive chat.



I get its more work. Maybe on the report player for bad reasons allow us 100-150 characters to explain?

Hey, I'm rather new to reddit, and I just made an account so I could post somewhere that could actually help and NOT direct me to another forum where I "should post". Anyways, I've tried all the solutions to this error including updating my video drivers, updating directX, putting in all the launch commands, simply restarting the PC, using the windows compatibility troubleshooter, and even re-installing the game twice. None of it has worked, and its really annoying me since I'm an avid player. 

 

My most important specs are:

-Windows 10

-Nvidia Geforce GT 720 (Video Card)



Also, whenever it does this, the CS:GO process is still running as a backround process.

So me and my friend Jake are on a walk in Seattle and me being newly introduced to the city I'm absolutely infatuated with the diversity of women and of course the plethora of opportunity in my midst.

Jake suggests we go get froyo because he wants to show me the UW campus that I'll be studying at in the fall and I'm down so we go. Upon walking down the sidewalk heading towards the froyo place we see two really attractive females one white blonde and one Asian with dark hair, both extremely attractive to me and my friend. We go through the froyo place that they also were going into and we get our yogurt and sit down, they chose a table fairly close to us definitely within ear shot.



Here's where things fuck up.



I've never had much confidence whether it be picking up women or anything to do with dating. My friends all say I'm a fairly attractive guy, 6'0 pack of abs decent build, but I've just not had enough interaction to consider myself "smooth" with the ladies.

Jake insists that it'll be good for me to go up to them and ask for the less attractive asian one's number, suggesting that maybe it'll be easier since it's in a group and will lower chances of getting shot down by the more attractive one. This all being bro-logic and no relevance to the story, actually ended up being true.

Back to the good part.



So I walked over to the table and was going to say something but instead grabbed napkins off the table. SUPER FUCKING AWKWARD. But they didn't even acknowledge or look at me so I assume no harm done I eye fucked them both as I took the napkins.

I sit back down and Jake is laughing at my failed attempt to have a set of nuts so he bets me 10$ against that I could ball out and actually get one of their numbers. Insisting that it will be good for personal development and confidence.



So I hatch this ingenious plan that I'm going to spill some more froyo on the table to have an excuse to get more napkins but here's where things got shaky.

Something told me to grab my cup of Froyo and slam it upside down on the table, effectively alerting the whole froyo place and all it's occupants that I just asserted a decent amount of force and effort purposely flipping over my cup of delicious chocolate cinnamon swirl yogurt (That jake bought mind you) at this point he's crying laughing not sure what the fuck I'm doing or how that was close to necessary. So I get up and start gathering courage, meanwhile chocolate yogurt is melting on the table and making a fucking huge mess. Girls are staring at our table like we're animals because I won't turn around and get napkins but what they don't know is it's because I just don't want to get the balls to talk to them



So Jake says he's giving me two minutes to muster up some balls before he cleans the mess and leaves because at this point he's not sure what the fuck I'm going to do next. Crying laughing but attempting to encourage me I finally decide to make my move.

Now the next few moments I can't explain, Jake was severely confused and still is to the point he woke up laughing later that night about it because that's how fucking distraught he was at the events that occurred from me flipping my yogurt purposely until the end.



So I walk up to the girls and I go to grab the napkins but instead of slide my body acrossed the table and plant my elbow on the table and my head in the palm of my hand, sexy man style. "Hey how is it going ladies" - Me "Hiiiii it's going good what about you" - Blonde, confused and concerned about how stupid I am for using this obvious ploy to talk to them meanwhile froyo is melting all over the table and dripping on floors. "I LOST" - Me

I basically sprinted to the door and tried to open it to escape the froyo place to no avail.

At this point Jake is fucking crying laughing on the booth froyo melting everywhere that I still haven't cleaned up I can only imagine his confusion at what he just witnessed.

We get up and leave and the asian girl is like "Uhh ok" and seems genuinely disappointed I didn't try to finish the conversation and ask for their number, Jake said from his perspective they totally were okay with the approach but in my head I went full fucking panic mode.



TL;DR Slammed my yogurt on table, lost 10$ bet to talk to girls, declared that I lost to the whole yogurt place and effectively failed exiting the situation quickly.

And I must have spaced out when it turned green, because the police came up to the window and asked, "Isn't there ANY color you like?"



I translated this from Chinese, so there's that.

Someone as Overall

By DeYtH Banger



Have you ever thought that somebody is spying you, somebody who is out of your friends (which you know)... it's mostly likely a stranger... who knows a lot of stuff about you... What is horrible!?... it's when your secrets get out. If they or he/she know your secrets, they aren't anymore secrets.



To be honest when I was ten years old or somewhere there I wanted to be inside of a body of animal or of a human... mostly likely... if it's about human to be gender female and  to live there,... sounds most likely crazy doesn't it?... As for reason I don't have such probably....Pfff...I am not very reasonable person.





Screaming as overall



Let's skip the manner in overall way... stress is a feature of overall... great example is school. School is pretty depressing and stressful place... As for screaming PLEASE.. .. stop.... stop for god sake.... this screaming should be punished with what...  KILLING YOU WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE ... and THAT'S THE WAY AND THE PATH TO become the son of butcher.



HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (Sounds like pretty bugged... But that is how I laugh... please let me to continue....)....AAAAAAAÀAAAAAAAAAA



....

I entered let's say FIRST THE PAST AND THEN the future... this above is older with few seconds, few minutes,

few hours and few classes so I entered by running it in home matrix.... with this limit board. Let's take it as  limit as something which is "Max"





....



....

Friends what type of friends???? Please tell me!?



People which are going to screw  my life behind my chest???

....



As someone in overall way in the end we all die... have to work on something but why???... Dead is something more famous in games like cs .../resetscore or /rs.





Why it just don't end right here??



Why??





After all I came out with "It's not a happy"...then "True".... then "The story in the jail"... then "Boring..."... and  probably everything in these stories have something in common.... and what is it?... If you ask you are probably very spoiled as a character... so I will make some kindness and I will say... I want to make a message.





Dieing after so much done read/listen/watch/eat ....books... films... series... movies.... creepypasta... food... friends and so on and so on? 





Pleasure!???



AS  for me in overall world in overall way pleasure is a door in the matrix which  you can't close and when you can't it happens like the jerk off... I couldn't close the door so it came in my mind "Check out that..."... "Sounds nice... nails footjob..."... "But why only nails footjob... why you don't make long nails footjob - sound awesome doesn't it?....""



... How does the fucking jerk off happen, mainly from that thought then another thought... then another... after another thought and slowly it just comes.... my mind says start... and I can't do anything. So what is your opinion on "can't control yourself?"





...



What happens when everything in your point of view is changed?



...



I just want silence, people to understand me and to be part of the normal world. That I write so gruesome stuff, means that I can't be The Second Stephen King!?? Or SOMEBODY LIKE HIM!?





I take "someone to understand you" and "to have silence" as stuff which are not granted. What to say!?



33% Battery, I have read a lot of creepy pasta (sounds like "I" someone in position look me... look... "I can"... and "You can't". But even and selfish character!)



"If" is the world... If we live in Matrix... so and "If" is commin very common word. I can say from here the cinema is stupid... a lot of pop corn, coca-cola... But in the end  after so much time my father died... however that's sad... and even now people ask stupid questions again.... and again.... and again.... and what are they are trying You can see "If" As "If you don't see me... go to catch the bus"... "If you are sad... slap a like to become happy."



(Is that a bug in the Matrix... glitch in matrix... perfect without perfection?)





So in overall you drink alcohol and smoke... you have friends when you stop... who will be your friend? Or friends!?



Even then... you can lose them somehow!





As for now awesome girls I don't have as friends in the real world...  





....



Okay, I am honest 3 stars for that and for that 4... As overall... BUT PLEASE STOP MOVING AND FOR LEE CHILD AUTHOR... I DON'T SUGGEST HIM... In HONEST WAY AND IN OVERALL ROAD HE SUCKS.



Cheating Dead



It is easy, everyone can do it, to cheat... you should start playing dead.



....





Lie





Lie could be spotted, it's easy... little confuse face... anger and in some more cases it goes like laugh... not staring in the... eyes. Or too much staring at the eyes.





Limit



Every word should be understand properly as overall school limits your abilities, I am sure in one... you can more.





Depression



Pressure = Depression so when you masturbate its not from pressure... it's most likely from  depression wanting to get out from this fucking overall world.





But it's not possible... pleasure = out of the world... negative = negative... so getting out you need "negative".





"DON'T WRITE ANYMORE ANYTHING EVER...".... "YOUR MEDICINE DOESN'T WORK."





Aàah.... aaaaaah so clever human being ... we both can't believe in that empty conclusion....!



I don't need  to give explanation or even for more to be accurate, I don't need to explain, If you don't get it... you are in the path of being overall... if you get it... Probably we both are on the same track.

[This is all from my dream]



The submarine is hard to destroy, so the advisor suggests to encapsulate it in eternal time-loop instead. From time to time the discussion is interrupted by yet another wave of zombies attacking the villain's base, so the villain and his advisor have to personally defend the base (probably due to lack of minions?).



Zombies have nothing to do with good guys from the submarine. During one of zombie waves the advisor recognises his own mother among zombies, but cold-bloodedly shoots her down with other zombies.

Game will begin in 3, 2, 1...    

I'm talking to    

you, the perfectly sanctioned embodiment of imperfection.  Here's the lesson    

in broad generics, not specifics to the collective, introspective generations.    

Where there was once the positive, but now you live trying to see through    

to the other side, why confide in any lie?  You must abide.  Yes, I'm talking to    

you.    

Next Level.    

You can't cock the glock, because glocks don't cock. Watch the clock.    

Is D-day coming soon?  It's only noon and you're melting from shock.    

Talk yourself down from this meltdown.  The crown's too heavy and blue.    

Try some vernacular waltzin like Christopher Walken. Yes, I'm talking to    

you.    

Pause.    

That cyanide pill stuck inside of your mouth, spit it out. How    

could your last breath come so fast if your past cowers behind you now?    

Don't conspire with the pain, the misfires in your brain gone askew.    

You've been fed up.  Don't dare let up.  Get your head up.  Yes, I'm talking to    

you.    

Boss Battle.    

Boat's still afloat. Keep that record goin and go spin some positive notes.    

Dont let external forces or common sources dictate all of your quotes.    

Stake the claim to your name.  Feel no shame in your game and pursue    

your happiness and love blessed with conciousness.  Yes, I'm talking to    

you.    

Continue?    

Press continue in this venue.  You have more tokens. Truth be spoken.    

Your dreams aren't broken.  It seems you need a galaxy of energy to soak in.    

Meditate or pray away the dismay, and seize the day with clarity renewed.    

The importance is the distance you run until it's done. Yes, I'm talking to    

you.    

Top Score!  Enter Initials...  _  _  _

Obligatory "this didn't happen today but a few years ago" blah blah blah fuck you.



Imagine 17 year old me, at a friend's house, downing vodka like nobody's business with my buddies. I'll spare you the details, we all had fun, hitting it off with banter, drunk FIFA, beer pong... you know, the usual get together between bros. What matters here is a series of unfortunate events the very next morning.



I woke up the next day with a bit of a hangover, and that plus having  slept only 3 hours had me pretty groggy in the morning. As I wake up, I walk over to my bathroom to brush my teeth and purge the nasty demon that is morning breath from my mouth. So I just grab my toothbrush, slather that baby up in minty nectar, and go to town ridding my mouth of all the gunk from the previous night.



I'm just standing there, blankly staring at my own face in the mirror, going over the past night of regular bro bonding. Oh yes, right there in front of me in the mirror is the knowing smile of the victor of drunk FIFA. Nevermind trial by combat - there is nothing better than proving your superiority, virility and masculinity than by decimating betas in a video game, and looking down at those that cower in defeat. Innocently, I was feeling pretty good with myself.



That was, until the taste in my mouth hit. And oh boy, was it foul. Is this what drinking bleach implies? The horrible taste of chemicals drowning all other sense inhibition? Oh mighty me, what in the everliving name of **fuck** is going on in my mouth?



It wasn't the minty nectar I was expecting when I was about to brush my teeth. It wasn't fucking toothpaste, my friends. The taste, oh GOD the taste. This isn't Oral-B's refreshing mint shit avalanche in my mouth.



I look over to my side, trembling, with my innards threatning to spill over my gullet, and peer at the open tube of paste next to the sink.



I read the label... and instead of the vibrant blue of Oral-B's toothpaste, I read... "Benzac AC". My facial cream for sprouts of acne.



I just fucking brushed my teeth with acne cream.



You know how just *thinking* of alcohol when hungover makes you queasy? Now imagine that chemical taste, in your mouth, expecting to alleviate some of your suffering with a minty fresh toothbrushing session, but instead being greeted with something else entirely, something that tastes similar to what Windex smells like.



To say I projectile vomited would be an understatement.



I hurl my toothbrush across, bouncing it off the wall and unto the floor, before rushing over to the toilet and just... going full fucking Krakatoa unto the gaping mouth of my poor, unexpecting toilet. O' holy ceramic receptacle, please forgive me for all the shit I give you. Literally. 



It was a fucking horror film. Dinner (junk food), alcohol, stomach acid and fucking acne cream all mixed into a beautiful stream of chaos. Crying, screaming and hurling, I purge my inner demons unto the john. Never have I ever experienced so much pain and suffering when puking.



Yes, the tube of my toothpaste and the one of acne cream are nothing alike. Yes, I didn't think twice about grabbing the first thing in my bathroom drawers to brush my teeth. Fucking sue me.



TL;DR: Both pimples and teeth are white and pointy / round. Fuck you.



Edit: i dont do word good

Been on Craigslist for a few weeks now and I really need a car to replace my old honda beater  that was in a car accident (not at fault). But the asking prices on there are just ridiculous, most of which are late 90s-early 00s with more than 160K miles and they're asking for like 3.5K-4K and some of them haven't even had their timing belt and water pump done yet. That is the same price range I got my old honda beater a decade ago  but it had 75K miles and was running well. There are also pos cars on there that have some kind of transmission problems or any major problems really and they want between$800-$1500. Simply put, hunting for an old honda beater on Craigslist has been very frustrating and I don't know if I should just get a pre owned car from the dealership. It'll cost more but at least I don't have to deal with mechanical problems anytime soon.

I know we can induce visual experiences in people who already have a functional visual system, [for example, in this subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwOoqkLwL40), or those who had a functional visual system but lost some functionality due to disease or injury. However what I am unaware of, is if it's possible to induce visual experiences in individuals who have been blind from birth, e.g. those that have no eyes, via stimulating or inducing the relevant activity in their brain.

I had avoided this due to not being a Michael Bay fan..





All I can do after watching it is eat humble pie. It was great. Some of the cinematography and shots in this film are incredible and not what I would associate with a Bay film.





Krasinski may have been cast just for the final 'phone call' scene but WHAT a scene it was. 



Highly recommend to anyone who was in the same camp as me previously

So we have eliminated our high-interest cc debt. We have 1k in emergency fund (easily accessible) and 2k in cds for emergency fund. 



We own our cars. I work very part-time and go to school. I will have my BSN in May 2018. Husband works FT and is in Navy reserves.  We have a 3yo. 



We owe 94k on our mortgage and still have PMI. We need to pay down an additional 9k to get rid of PMI. 



Hubby has about 80k in low interest school loans. 

I have about 25k in low interest school loans.



We have little savings as we traditionally spend what we make but we/I am trying to change that. 



Husband is currently deployed so making more $ than usual for 6 more months but his salary will return to normal after that. 



What should we do with the "extra" income over the next 6 months? It will work out to be around $40k.

Link to [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/56f6gp/whats_the_deal_with_blue_ridge_the_blue_ridge/)



As I was walking up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there.



He asked me how I got these scars. I told him, "Thank your lucky stars...



"I don't reveal the pain and fears, that make me laugh through bitter tears."



But then, I was alone, you see. The man who wasn't there, was me!



If you've read the previous two parts of this narrative, then you know why I've been seeing a psychologist. If not, I suggest you follow the link to the beginning and start from there, otherwise, these pages will make no sense. As for me, I wish it didn't make any sense at all, and I could forget the whole thing. But then, THAT'S been the whole problem, all along.



Are you back now? Good.



Now that you're caught up, I can begin this third, and GOD I hope, final installment!



So, a couple days after the "Midnight Drive of Paul Revere," I got in to see my primary care physician at my local VA clinic. I got right to business and told him the events of the Blue Ridge Fire, my recent obsession and mental disturbance, and finally, the last incident where I found myself AT Blue Ridge without remembering making the trip!



With the telling of the last part, he immediately picked up the phone and made me several "emergency" appointments at the Seattle Hospital. He said, "Don't drive, I'll arrange transportation." 



He's a good PA who doesn't screw around. It's because of his thoroughness, that I wasn't sent right back to work after my last back injury. He found irreversible damage in the X-rays of my lower back, and told me I was done working in my field. At 57 years old - at the time - that meant I was done working. I filed for disability - after further workups at American Lake - and received my award letter, after the, obligatory, five-month wait, no further questions asked.



So, when John says, "Don't drive," I listen. The next day, I caught the VA shuttle to Seattle where I had X-rays, blood work, CAT Scans, MRIs - all negative - and my first meeting with a psychologist in years.



Her name was Kathy and we met for an intake. She asked my recent history, so I told her about the "walk off" several years earlier, my TIA - mini stroke- history, my propensity for depression - dysthymia - and how I coped with that and stress in general, i.e. not well.



Since I was already retired, she recommended I stay a few days to a week so I could begin treatment in a safe place. Except for a co-pay for medications, all my health care is covered by the VA, so I agreed and would meet with her every day for about a week. She also put me on mild antidepressants, that would be administered by the pharmacy on a daily basis, for the duration of my stay. She was taking no chances with my case and I appreciated that.



The rest of the day was spent admitting me. They set me up in a private room - I guess they didn't want to "endanger" any other patients - and a schedule for my medications. Along with my antidepressants, they also administered my blood pressure meds.



The next day, I met with Kathy, who started a "loose" form of psychotherapy. You know how it goes; they ask a lot of uncomfortable questions about your history, your feelings about that history, if you harbor hard feelings toward your mother, father, siblings, ex-wife, kids, anybody else in your life, traumatic experiences - WAIT! The Blue Ridge Fire! But why was THAT a “traumatic” experience? It didn't happen to ME! - and all the rest of the stuff that I had become accustomed to, since long before the "walk off."



So, after determining that I subconsciously felt the Blue Ridge fire was a traumatic experience, we started to hone in on that. Kathy practiced a form of relaxation therapy, not unlike hypnotherapy but without an actual trance. I was instructed to create a mental "safe space" in my imagination that I could retreat to any time I felt too uncomfortable with the subject matter. Then she would hold up a pencil and have me follow it with my eyes as she waved it in figure eights in front of them, stimulating a REM type memory response. As she did this, she would ask questions relating to the period of time surrounding the fire.



During the evenings, while we were pursuing this line of enquiry, my dreams would become almost violent. Several times a night, the nurses would come in to wake me as I tossed and turned and moaned out loud. After a couple nights like that, they sent me for a sleep study. Results? Negative.



On the third day of therapy, Kathy brought in the hospital psychiatrist to prescribe sleep medications. He sat in on the rest of our session, taking copious notes. It was then that the focus of my memories dredged up something unexpected, my first crush.



Remembering Krissy didn't bring happiness or even sorrow, but a profound dread, instead. It was, also, very unexpected because I thought my first "girlfriend" was Shirley! She was the little girl who lived down at the bottom of the hill, and who's brothers and older sister would bully the hell out of me and my siblings.



But now I'm remembering being about eight years old, playing with a little black boy named Christopher, and a little blonde girl named Krissy – Chris and Kris… interesting, - in the school playground during recesses and lunch.



The psychologist pricked his ears up at this. "Do you remember any bad experiences with either or both children?" He asked?



Suddenly I saw myself pushing a slightly older version of Christopher to the ground in a fit of rage and Krissy rushing to his side to comfort him.

 

"Why did I do THAT?!" I asked aloud. "He was my friend!"



"He must have done something to make you very angry." The Shrink suggested. But I couldn't remember what it was. I only remember that relations were strained between us after that. They still played with me, but it always felt like they were walking on egg shells around me. But then, I was walking on eggshells around myself, whenever I was with them.



As I related this to Kathy and the Shrink, I suddenly saw a flash, in my mind's eye, of a trash can on our back porch in the Heights. It was gone in an instant but it had interrupted my train of thought.



"Did something just happen?" Kathy asked. 



I shook my head. "Nothing related to what we were discussing." I replied.



"Why don't you tell us anyway." The Shrink leaned forward as he said this. I told him, a little too quickly, that I really couldn't remember what it was. They looked at each other for a second and then Kathy said, "I think this may be a good time for your safe place. We'll take a break and continue tomorrow."



The Shrink got up to leave. "Before I go," He said, "I would like you to sleep tonight on the events around Krissy and Christopher. If you need to, that is, if you find yourself too agitated, don't hesitate to go to your 'safe place,' but I'd like to hear more about this." He turned to Kathy and asked, "Do you have a recording device of some kind?"



"I've got one in the top drawer here."



"Good. I have too many appointments tomorrow to sit in, but I'd like to review these sessions if you don't mind." Kathy agreed and the Shrink left. We finished up with "safe place" therapy for about five minutes and I left to go back to the ward. My "safe place" had let me down, because I wasn't the least bit relaxed!



Old feelings, I had completely forgotten, were coming back to me after years and years of dormancy. As I walked back to the ward, memories swarmed my senses until I could barely see the hallway I was walking through; I passed my room. In my mind, I saw Christopher and Krissy out behind the ball shed at school. She was holding his hand and they were talking about me.



"I don't like him anymore." Krissy was saying. "I like you now!" 



Upon hearing this, I remembered springing into action. In a jealous rage, I rushed Christopher, grabbed him by the front of his shirt and threw him to the cement of the ball court. Krissy screamed and ran to him, crying. 



She turned on me, tears in her eyes. "What are you doing?!" She demanded. "He didn't do anything to you!" I couldn't say anything. I just turned and ran back into the building and my classroom. 



Funny how I always thought I was the one who always got bullied. Now, it seems, it may have started with me bullying my best friend. This also explained why I could never defend myself, but had no problem defending others. I wasn't afraid; I was guilty!



And during all of this, my mind would, intermittently, flash to the trash can behind our house. Every time this happened, I would clench my fists and tense my body, trying to fight off a horrible rage, seething at the back of my memory.



I finally came around to my room again. This time I noticed it, so I went in and fell on my bed, tears tearing at my vision and a low moan escaping my lips. "What kind of a creep am I?" I asked myself. What did I DO!?"



That night, my sedatives did no good. I suffered rapid fire nightmares. But, because of the sleep aids, I couldn't wake from them and no nurse came to rouse me.



In one dream, I would see myself pummeling Christopher half to death. In the next I'd be on the Bus with Krissy. That's RIGHT, it all started because we rode the bus together! Christopher did not. He knew Krissy, because I had introduced them!



In another dream, I'd be staring into an empty garbage can on the back porch of... Wait! It WASN'T my back porch! In the next dream Krissy, would be getting off the bus in Blue Ridge! It was all coming back to me in hazy fits and starts. Krissy got off the bus, a black spaniel - It was the one I THOUGHT belonged to our family friends, downtown - was always waiting in the yard for her.



I'll bet you can guess which God Damn HOUSE she lived in! God, how I hoped the dreams weren't accurate! In my mind's eye, I watched her walk to the front door of that stupid house, dog on her heels. She went in and then... and then... the house was engulfed in flames! Now the dream had morphed. It was night and the house was on fire!



I threw myself out of my bed screaming. THAT'S when the nurse finally came in to see what the commotion was! Another nurse came and they got me back into bed. I was crying. The on-call doctor came in a little later and gave me a more powerful sleep aid. I was out for the rest of the night, no more dreams.



I know what you must be thinking. At this point, I was thinking it too! But wait, it gets weirder!



The next day, with the recorder on, I started to relate my dream to Kathy. When I had finished, and told her what I thought it all meant, she shook her head. "Therapy like the method we are using," she started, "Doesn't always create real memories. Sometimes, the memories are symbolic of issues buried too deep to get at. I don't think it's wise to jump to any fantastic conclusions based on them just yet."



"But I was there. I SAW the fire! I must have started it... in the trash can!" I was so sure of my conclusions, but Kathy refused to give them credence.



"How old were you at the time of the fire?" she asked? 



"Eleven." I replied. 



"And what time of night did the fire start?"



"I don't know. It was Halloween night is all I know about the time."



"So, how did you get from the Heights to Blue Ridge?"



"I don't remember, but the memory of being there is pretty clear. For all I know I could have flown!"



Kathy just shook her head. "I think it's about time to do some REM work." She said. "Maybe we can add some clarity to your disparate recollections."



"OK, but I doubt there's anything more to recall." I sat back in my chair and counted to ten. She placed her pencil in front of my face and started drawing figure eights in the air. Almost immediately, I was lost in memory.



It was Halloween night, 1969. We had just returned home from trick-or-treating the Emerald Heights housing project. There were so many houses, with two or four apartments each, that we never needed to go anywhere else to get a huge stash of candy. 



We had all picked several pieces of candy from our individual bags and retired for the night. Mom kept the bags in her and Dad's room so we couldn't pig out all night in the seclusion of our own rooms. I always suspected they raided our bags while we slept.



I wasn't sleeping this night though. I waited for the sounds of the house to quiet and, dressed for a long walk in cold weather, slipped out the fire escape in my room and down to the yard below. I had a plan.



Earlier in the day, I had seen Christopher and Krissy arguing while we were waiting for our buses home. She hadn't said anything during the ride and I was afraid to ask, fearing she would immediately see through my motives. Her eyes were still red and she sniffed back more tears as we entered the Blue Ridge area. She got off at the one stop, under the lone streetlight. Winter was almost upon us and the sky was pretty dark by the time we arrived there.



So, that night, I had made my mind up I was going to walk the three or four miles, out of the Heights, and up to Blue Ridge. I took an old pillow case, intending to use the excuse of trick-or-treating her house so I could get a chance to talk to her. It took a while, but I got there. I have no idea how long it took - it seemed to take forever - but someone had beaten me there!



As I approached the house, I could see someone in silhouette standing in the shadows of the back porch. Suddenly, a huge blaze flared up in the garbage can and lit up the figure until I could tell it was Christopher! He ran off without seeing me.



I had a choice. I could follow Christopher or I could alert the house about the fire. The decision was made for me, when a woman came out of the neighboring house. She ran around toward the front of the threatened property. I figured they'd get the fire under control and I could run down Christopher before he could get too far. As I plunged into the woods, in pursuit, I could hear the neighbor pounding frantically at the front door and screaming an alert to the residents.



I could hear Christopher in the woods ahead of me. He was crashing and swearing as he tried to get away from the scene. I imagine he could hear me following because he seemed to double his speed. Since he had not seemed to see me, I doubted he knew who was in pursuit. He only knew he was in danger of being discovered or caught.



Suddenly, I couldn't hear brush crashing anymore and I soon emerged from the woods at the bottom of the hill. Christopher was nowhere to be seen. I returned the way I had come, to the top of the hill, to find the house totally engulfed in flames, and Krissy’s mother screaming hysterically as people held her back from the fire.



I was tired and numb and couldn't grasp the import of her frenzy. It never occurred to me that not everybody had gotten out. I didn't see Krissy or her little brother. I figured they were milling around out of sight. I decided I better get out of there before I became the primary suspect.



It was almost morning by the time I made it home. I climbed the fire escape and crawled into bed, grateful that it was Saturday and I wouldn't have to get up for school.



Later - and I mean MUCH later - that morning I woke tired and sore. I drug all the rest of the day and felt like I'd fought World War Three, all by myself. Every muscle ached and there were scratches here and there on my shins and hands. The pants I wore the day before were in near tatters.



"When did this happen?" I thought when I saw them. I couldn't remember; the day before was too hazy. For some reason, I threw them away rather than put them in the wash. Somehow, I knew I didn't want Mom to see them and ask me questions I couldn't answer.



When Dad got home and Mom got up that morning, I heard about the fire the night before. I felt terribly saddened, though I didn't really know why. I heard two children had died in the fire. I felt a sense of loss, though I didn't know what. It was all just too hazy.



From that day forward, I dreaded passing through Blue Ridge and its melancholy surroundings.



Kathy stopped the session at that point and told me it was important to place myself in my "safe place" right away. I realized I was wet with tears, all the way down my shirt. "I think we can trust THESE memories." I said after doing "safe place" therapy for several minutes.



"For the most part, I think so." she replied. "I'll call the psychiatrist and get you strong sleep aids for tonight and I'll see you tomorrow at the usual time. We'll see what we can do to help you deal with this."



I slept like the dead that night, and the next day, Kathy gave me her opinion of my case, and a prognosis.



"I consulted with the psychiatrist after he listened to our recording." she informed me. "We have come to some conclusions together and want to run them by you to see what you think.



I just nodded in agreement. I was still mentally exhausted by the previous day's events.



"It's clear, you've been trying to work through the trauma of that night for a long time. The revelations of yesterday make it pretty obvious what the symbols in your dreams are about.



"The sirens, that seem to precipitate a dream sequence, are connected to Krissy’s dog. It's a hint of who's memory you suppressed, your mind trying to clue you in, the long way 'round."



I listened intently. I had come to a similar interpretation while waiting for my appointment. I was interested to see if the rest matched up.



"Leaving by way of the fire escape coincided with your suppressed memory of sneaking out that night. The walk down the street, could symbolized the trek to Blue Ridge."



"What about walking with members of my family?" I queried.



"Probably a need to feel secure, supported. I noticed your father was never in the dreams. Did you have issues with him?"



"He had anger and violence issues. He was a good guy most of the time, but was pretty rough with us kids whenever he was mad. He certainly would NOT have made me feel safe!" She nodded knowingly. I was thinking I could have come up with all this myself, after all the therapy I’d had in the past, and wondered if any of this was going to help my treatment. I suppose knowing what it was all about, finally, would help me, in time.



"You said Christopher was a black boy, so you're dream antagonist becomes an indistinct black shadow. You, also, saw him in silhouette when you first arrived on the scene of the arson. His symbol was indistinct and ghost like because of that or, possibly, there’s still a hidden issue associated with him."



"Maybe the persistence of glowing green eyes is a symbol of jealousy. You were jealous of Christopher, and he may have committed arson as a response to a similar emotion. 



"I'm not sure if I have an interpretation of the hundreds of dogs and children. Maybe it was just a subconscious ploy to show the importance of these symbols. Dreams are very random and can turn anything into a symbol or just throw an image in for, seemingly, no reason at all.



"I think you know what the garbage can is about." she concluded.



"OK," I agreed, "But how does this affect my prognosis?" I loved using medical terms with medical staff, it made me feel smarter than the average patient.



She put her notes down and just looked at me for a second. Then she took a deep breath and said, "I think, with some antianxiety meds, for a little while, and some rest, you'll be good as new, or maybe even better, now that you know what memories you had suppressed. A little PTSD therapy might be in order as well. I can set that up at American Lake so you won't have to make the trip up here every couple of weeks."



"What about driving?"



"Go back to driving as usual, if your new medications don't make you too drowsy. If you have another episode, call me direct and make a new appointment to see me. I don't think that will be a problem though. You know everything your subconscious was trying to reveal. There's no reason for it to continue to interfere."



The next day, I rode the shuttle home. Now I knew why my whole life had been such a strange sequence of failures and tragedies. I'd been running from demons I couldn't handle, relentlessly chasing me like the hounds of Hell. Hmm, hounds... go figure!



But there was still one unsolved mystery. Where did Krissy and her brother's remains go? Perhaps it really WAS just a wild rumor, with no basis in fact!



I tried to satisfy myself with that theory, but that night, in my dreams, I was suddenly flung into the past, once more. 



Again, I was coming up to Krissy’s house, that Halloween night. But, this time, there were THREE silhouettes on the back porch! When the flames leapt up from the can, I could make out the figures of Krissy, her brother and Christopher before they, all three, ran off into the woods!



I woke suddenly, startled by the sound of my own voice, "BITCH!"

Downgraded to a studio here in Seattle and the pre-war bldg came with what the realtor called a Murphy Door (kinda hard to explain, video has full narration).  I'd like to make a... I dunno,  Murphy Box that attaches to the door and is on casters so it can swing around but the door doesn't have to take the load. (https://youtu.be/sitEeuRugNg)



Will be using a full-size mattress and would  like it really low to the floor.



Any advice would be awesome before i start my design b/c a) I haven't worked construction in 15 yrs and b) my wife doesn't think there's any way this will happen.



Thx!

Hello fellow double-Xers, I need advice and wasn't sure where to go.



I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend yesterday, and took a morning after pill today at about midday with no issues. I went back to the boyfriend's house later on (about 3pm) and had sex again, this time with a condom, but it broke! I've tried searching the internet but couldn't find any answers, do I need to take another pill, or will I be ok with the first one? I know it takes about two hours for the medication to be fully absorbed and start working, so I'm unsure about this 3-4 hour window.



Sorry if this is not a great place to post this, I just wasn't sure where to go. If you know any other places/subreddits where I should put this question, please let me know. I appreciate your help friends!

I am currently working on fixing up my credit, as quickly as I can, and I was wondering if it was worth writing a goodwill letter to Chase Auto. I have a 30-day late payment way back in 2013. The car has been paid off since July 2015 so it's a closed account.



Will creditors look at letters for closed accounts?



**Background for possible letter**



I had a bad year in 2014 with over 7 months of unemployment and my credit has taken a huge hit, but I've tried patching it back up. It was at a 502 and now it's sitting at 637 according to TU.



-I got an unsecured card and made on time and early payments for 2 years. I tried to keep utilization under 30%



-Paid 30k worth of debt in a year



-Had a charge off completely removed from my credit history



**Possible obstacle for Goodwill Letter**



I have another 120 day late account regarding my student loan payment...I buried my head in the sand when unemployed - Do not recommend this. I finally had the loan deferred for a few months then put it on IDR when I finally got a low paying job.



I was hoping to contact Great Lakes directly and see if they would be willing to take off the late account report if I signed up for auto-enroll...I'm not sure it that would work, though. Should I address this account before sending Chase a goodwill letter?

I don't mean to put a negative light on anyone - I know that people are homeless for a variety of reasons, addicted to drugs for a variety of reasons and the worth of what you've done with your life is subjective. But I realised today that I can't figure out what direction to take my life in, I'm not one of those people who can just suck it up and choose one and there's a good chance I'll end up going nowhere.

A new Officer arrives in Afghanistan and is being shown around by a Sergeant. They walk by a donkey tied up in a pen and the officer asks what it's purpose is.



The Sergeant explains "The men use it when they have certain...urges. it gets very lonely out here"

Six months go by and the Officer is getting urges himself and decides that he has to go use the donkey.

"Am I doing it right? Isn't this how the men do it?" asks the Officer



"Well, no sir, they usually just ride the donkey down to the next village where the brothel is"

This will allow you to more easily "Peel" off the ice without having to risk breaking your light enclosure trying to bust it up. Break the ice above the wrap and the rest kind of falls off, or you can just peel the rest off with the wrap. It is very dangerous driving with ices over lights.

When we eat, say, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, some of us might be able to handle 4-5 before starting to get that nauseous "sick" feeling that we need to stop. How exactly does our body know it is getting too much sugar and "where" does this physical sensation originate? (The best I can explain the sensation is that the "gut" seems to feel nasty)



Also, how is it that some people like [Matt Stonie] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBlMl9BOanY) can destroy a dozen of these doughnuts without even a hint of feeling sick? Is he missing some kind of signals/receptors in his body?

I'll be early separating at the beginning of next year. Being that it's earlier than expected, I don't have much in savings at all. I was pretty terrible with saving the last few years, and I take responsibility for that. Anyways, my plan is to move to Chicago, and just rent a room for about $500, work and take a class before moving to San Francisco in the Fall to attend City College for a year before transferring. Though I don't have any savings, my GI Bill will be paying out nearly $40,000 in housing allowance my first year at City College. I'll be living in Student Housing, paying about $800 a month. My question is, would I be able to get a loan to cover my first year of rent, and first few months of random expenses before my GI Bill kicks in? Would this be advisable? Thanks for the advice, and let me know any other clarifications I can make.

So I was walking through the park with my father, and we saw two dogs humping, so I asked "Papa, what are they doing?"  "Making a puppy" he responded.



A few hours later it was my bedtime, and all I could think about was the dogs humping, so I went to talk to my father.  When I went downstairs I discovered my father on top of my mother.  "What are you doing to Mom?" I asked.  "Making you a baby brother." said my father.  I responded "No, flip her over!  I'd rather have a puppy."

Hello, My mother recently informed me that she has breast cancer and lymph cancer. I would like your advice on how I can be supportive. I live on a different continent, I can't travel to see her for over one years time. We talk by phone once a week on Sunday and I don't know what to say. She informed me over e-mail today so tomorrow is the first time we would speak about this subject. I have no idea how to be supportive in such a situation. I have no idea what she may possibly be feeling. I have tried to conduct research on the matter but it seems every website offers advice that is board-line offensive ("talk about thinks they like", "dont tell them about people who have died"). I'm lost. I have no idea what to do. I apologize if this does not fit your criteria, is in the wrong place, or is insensitive. If it is please at least tell me where to go to find more information.

My wife and I are looking to buy our first house in the next 6-8 months. We've done some classes and I'm doing a lot of research on my own. My situation is as follows. 



Right now, we don't have kids. We are looking for a place that will comfortably accommodate us for the next 5-8 years or so. Kids are a possibility but not certain, and we don't want to buy a place that's too big and overpriced in the event we don't have them at all. My thought is that, likely, we'll be selling this house within 10yrs. 



On the savings plan we are on right now, we anticipate having about 10℅ of the total home price down in cash. I understand that bigger down payment leads to lower interest rate. However, how big of a deal is that difference (say, putting 20k down instead of 30k on a 300k house) if I don't intend to pay the entire term of the mortgage? 



That is, if we sink that cash in as a down payment, is the mortgage interest savings over the 5-10yrs we actually pay on the mortgage worth the extra cash up front? Or are we as well or better off making a more modest down payment and keeping some extra cash on hand if we just plan to move on in the reasonably short term?



Hopefully that makes sense. Thanks in advance.

I have found that my viewing has become almost exclusively TV shows.



I think there are a number of reasons.



Firstly - personally, a lifestyle change since having a baby: getting to the cinema is logistically so much more complex now that I simply don't do it. This I miss: one of my favourite pastimes used to be going to a cinema with a more eclectic/arthouse mix of movies and just walking in and seeing whatever happened to be showing. No preview, no blurb, no advertising, nothing more than knowing the title printed on the ticket. Seen so many good things that way.



But that doesn't really explain movies: why is it that when I open Netflix or similar, I'm just never drawn to the movies? I am watching concurrently six or seven excellent TV shows that keep me totally gripped, entertained, and with incredible performances by incredible actors.



I'm trying to remember the last movie I saw. It was at a relatives house, and he had some DVDs he'd rented, and recommended that we watch **Money Monster**.  It seemed a good choice - George Clooney, Julia Roberts, directed by Jodie Foster; even a guest appearance by Catriona Balfe, a favourite of mine from **Outlander.** So a good cast, a topical topic, I'd seen a couple of previews a while back and thought it looked interesting enough.



And yet, I found it very shallow and very boring. Now, it's not a great film, I guess. And there are plenty of bad TV shows. But I think it's a film I would've enjoyed more a few years ago. It seemed rushed, there seemed so many opportunities for development that just weren't pursued because it's only 100 minutes long.



I know it's supposed to be the golden age of TV, and... maybe that's true. If that's the best a few major Hollywood stars can come up with, then maybe they're just not trying hard enough? That's not going near all the endlessly awful Transformers-et-al films that dominate the box office.



Or maybe it's just simply that I've accidentally "gamified" my TV viewing: I use an app to keep track of the shows, how many episodes left, broadcast dates etc; this means that there is a sort of slightly obsessive imperative to watch more of each show, and any diversion to some other entertainment is like a wasted opportunity when I could be ticking off another show on the list.



So perhaps it's just me with a mild addiction?

A shy young man who on his 25th birthday confides to his best friends hes never been laid. They all have a laugh and poke fun, one chap asks "not even a 69", the shy young man just looks back puzzled, with that its decided they're pitching in and taking him to the whore house to get a "69". When they arrive, with nervous laughter they ask the Madame to see the girls and  select an older one who promises to be gentle and show him the ropes. They go back to the room and the young man is asked to disrobe and lay down on the bed, the prostitute then proceeds to straddle his face and give him a blowy, about 5 minutes in she lets out a big juicy fart, the young man being shy doesn't say anything and proceeds to munch her box, then a minute later she lets another rip, this time its like someone peeled an onion in his mouth so he jumps up and says, "Mam keep the money there's no fucking way I can handle 67 more of those."

"A B C C C C C C C D E F..."



"Stop" the teacher interrupts "thats not right BB there is only one C"



BB looks at her as if she's an idiot



"WRONG" he retorts "THERE ARE *SEVEN C's*"

I want to play Dying Light, but it's so confusing.  There's the base game, the expansion "The Following", "The Folowing enhanced edition", "Dying Light enhanced edition", "Dying Light Season Pass" which may or may not include either the base game or the expansion (and if it doesn't include the expansion, what the hell kind of season pass is it?) and then random other DLC.  But what package do I buy?  Why is it so hard?



Edit:  [Here's a picture of what I mean... you need to buy Dying Light: The Following to buy Dying Light: The Following?](http://i.imgur.com/N4a5sdP.png)



Edit2: And now there's apparently an uncut version... I guess that version has gentile zombies?

I have realized that I know very little about most historical things, and part of that is because textbook learning doesn't really grab my attention. The few historical fiction books I've read, however, really make the stories come alive and I'm able to remember it much better! 



I really don't care what historical event(s) it's about - anything to help me increase my knowledge would be great! I just want it to be well written, interesting, and historically accurate. Any suggestions? :-)

I took a job in a different state (CO) but am planning on moving back (to AZ) at the end of this year. I was here the beginning of August and will be here til the end of December. When filling out tax paperwork for the company I put the family member's address that I'm staying with in CO, so I'm wondering if I completely waived my residency by doing this.



I kind of looked through some various schools websites to see their take on it, but it seems like it heavily relates to "intent" which I feel they could skew either way.



Did I give up residency by taking a job in a different state and putting that state's address on my employment paperwork? Thanks!

Hi, I haven't played a battlefield game since 4 which I didn't really like, but I loved bad company 2 and battlefield 3, I have just about enough for one new game and although the reviews are looking great I was interested to hear what you guys think, I would only really be getting it for the multiplayer and will most likely be getting it on PC, thanks.

My military career is coming to an end next year after my enlistment ends. I have over $25,000 in my savings and zero debt. No car payments, college loans, nothing. The only two bills I have are internet and cellphone. I'm happily married, and me and my wife are looking to move back home to Hawaii after all is done. I don't have a job lined up yet but various family and friends have offered. I'm unsure about whether I'd like to go to college or enter the work force. Also, having been overseas for over half my career, my credit is likely non-existent (I think). I'm looking into opening a checking account with USAA here shortly. Where can I go from here, /r/personalfinance?



Edit: Forgot to add, I use Mint on my phone to track my finances religiously.

I'm an Irish-American (dual citizen), spent the majority of my life living in fair Ireland. Graduated from university this year, planning on moving to the states next September-ish. I'm aware having a good credit rating will really help with getting a rental contract, maybe a small car financing deal, but I have absolutely zero credit history in the US. Thinking of getting a credit card and using it as a debit card, only spending the money in my account, but how can I ensure that the credit rating I build up will count towards my rating in the States? If I open it with an American company will that work? (I have zero debt and a stable salary here in Ireland if that makes a difference).

I've always found this issue paradoxical.



Almost by definition, increasing technological unemployment goes hand in hand with increasing post-scarcity. Think 10-15 years down the road when future Watson type medical Expertise AI can do most medical diagnosis.  Sure lots of humans Doctors will be un/underemployed - but that AI can be replicated endlessly out to 8 billion on the whole planet for pennies each.  



We don't have that just yet, but we could build post-scarcity college & adult education - why don't we?



All the tech is there - you can see it with Coursea, Udacity, Khan Academy, etc, etc - but its all still on the margins of education.



Building a post-scarcity education system is much more achievable too; it doesn't require huge political change or a referendum 



Yet - even though UBI/technological unemployment & post-scarcity are so closely coupled - why is it only one side of this equation seems to get all the attention?

I don't imagine it was a picnic for them but we all know a lot about the British and the German side of things and it seems that people overlook Austro-Hungary's contribution in World War 1. 



Does anyone know what it would've been like to be an Austro-Hungarian soldier in World War 1? Did they do anything differently to other nations? The fact that they were basically two nations in a single army possibly meant that a language barrier could've existed depending if they would have Austrian's and Hungarians in the same group. Or was it always Austrians and Hungarian's being separate?

Please use a throwaway and avoid answering specific questions!



- How prevalent are surgeries, steroids, Botox, etc in the industry? 



- how prevalent are hard drugs?



- are there hierarchies of actors within Hollywood? Like can famous person A not just walk up to famous person B? 



- what is the best part about being famous?

For me my favorite time online was on Killzone 2 on the PS3 it was during a moment in high school were I was maturing different friends, stuff like that so I always played games alone. Killzone 2 is what I want battlefield online to feel like a big map but not huge it is now, tons of choke points/ mini full scale battles that basically get really hectic. I always thought the medic was the best class in the game, but at such an early age I didn't really heal much, mostly myself . I can't get that feeling from an online game anymore and he makes me sad a bit, i guess that means I'm maturing more or getting older my taste in gaming is changing. I just wish they would remaster it though it seems like Gorilla games has gone down in quality lately with the latest killzone . 



Edit: Also really excited to play CoD4 again. They should've just released CoD4 again for PS4 instead of this new CoD.

Hey all. I have been wanting to try making a detailed cast of a human skull for a while now, but cant find any good tutorials. I have done plenty of looking, but none are what I am looking for. I want to be able to cast and mold a human skull, while still being able to preserve the details in the final cast. More specifically, I want to have the hollow nasal passage, the optical nerve passing, etc. I know that I would have to rotocast to make it hollow, but dont know how to preserve the details. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

I just watched the movie, and despite the critiques I've heard, I went into it mostly blind. I thought it was rather well done. One scene in particular really caught me. Xavier and Magneto are talking at the end, and Magneto asks Xavier if he ever wakes in the middle of the night, worried that "they'll come for you, and your children." Xavier responds that he does, and he feels pity for the people that come looking for him and his students.

I went and looked up "Xavier and Magneto" and the first link was of them playing chess in one of the earlier movies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWDDVuxFboI

Basically a rehash of the exact same dialog, but I thought it was well done. I really enjoyed the relationship portrayed by Stewart and McKellan, and I'm glad the more recent movies are doing a good job of continuing that rivalry and friendship.

Also watching Wolverine go crazy on his escape was just plain fantastic.

I've heard a lot of people saying it didn't live up to the hype, but frankly going into it without a huge build up of 'best move ever' - it was a good sequel despite the Phoenix ex machina at the end.

I very recently have watched a couple of lectures about how good storytelling can be almost a hack to having great conversations and making a great impression.





I figured I would like to see great examples of really good storytelling(like the dad in Big Fish), and hear your opinions on storytelling in general - the structure, the delivery and so and so.

Just to give you some context, this is my music teacher I'm talking about. He's 55 and married and has two kids, he's also notorious for being a perv. 



So, I'm sitting in class, all the lights are off and the movie Amadeus is playing. I'm bored out of my mind watching this movie and I start to look around his room. I started to look at him just as this girl got up from her seat to hand in a late assignment. She hands it in and as she walks back to her chair, I see him obviously stare at her butt and give some sort of nod of approval. He then immediately see's me staring at him with my mouth opened. He tries to play it off by staring at a window.



  I was taken back. I looked around to see if anyone had witnessed this. I turned to my friend and asked "Holy shit, did you see that?" he replied yes with this face o_o. We started to break into a fit of laughter. He stops the movie and ask's us if we'd like to share what's so funny in an obnoxious way. My friend says "Im laughing cause you just looked at a 13-year-olds butt" Everyone in the room burst into laughter and in a fit of rage he gives everyone 20% off their test grades. Including me.



(FYI this classroom had people of all ages, im 16 but the age range of the class is 12-17)

I'm a senior in college right now with plans to go to law school. However, I'm starting to think that I want to take a gap year. I've grown up my entire life sheltered and completely supported by my family and I need a change. I love them very much but I feel like I need to do this because I won't ever have the opportunity to do this at any other point in my life. 



I have about $7500 in savings and I wouldn't ask my family for any support financially. I want to do this on my own. I'm currently in the northeast and I'd like to move somewhere relatively far. So far I'm thinking of places like Seattle, New Orleans, Madison, Atlanta, Phoenix but I'm pretty open to other places. 



I was wondering what steps I would need to take to make this work. I would only be living out there for a year so I was wondering if I should seek an actual desk job with a business (I have a degree in mathematics) or something that doesn't require skills like a cashier or store clerk. Would I be able to support myself with that kind of job and 7500 in savings? Could I land a "real" job for a year. I have so many questions and if anyone who has done this could offer some input that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

A little thought and talent could take this series a long way! The movies (and TV series) were cool (some cooler than others) and the premise is incredible. Of all the reboots and updates, why aren't these getting the treatment!? I bet Michael Lambert, Roxanne Hart, Clancy Brown, and Sean Connery would be down to take part in small roles and hand over the series to a younger crew of bad asses.

I'm studying french literature and am learning to go more in-depth in the texts than I was previously inclined to do as a reader. I was quite happy of the improvements I recently made, especially regarding poetry. 



But yesterday, a friend I asked for suggestions of short stories in English recommended me to read Nabokov's 'Signs and Symbols'. I was quite unsure what to think about it after reading it, and I went to check that [awesome analysis](https://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/dolinin.htm) on Penn State University website. It struck me that I don't think I would've been able to come to half of these conclusions by myself. Since I didn't like that much the story before reading the analysis, and that after the analysis my opinion changed, it saddened me that I basically didn't like it because I wasn't able to understand it, which seems to me like a problem.



So my question to you would be : do you think such deeper comprehension of text comes with practice? Is this story harder to appreciate than most others? (I doubt it since it's a classic.) Have you experienced something similar at one point?



(Here is [Nabokov's story](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/05/15/symbols-and-signs) if you're interested.)

Hi, I was alone at home and was getting bored. Was trying out make me busy somewhere but was failed. Then i decided to watch porn movie. I fucked up as started search for the Porn DVD i bought years before when i was too young as there was IP restriction on my PC to avoid porn content.

The DvD cover was also printed with Porn Pictures. When i was watching the movie i got so much involved when the door bell rung. I paused and minimized the video player and went out to see was out there. I was surprised that he was my neighbout with a DvD iin his hand. He asked me whether he can use my computer for a few minutes to send some date from DVD because his computer was crashing repeatedly. I was shocked to know this because if i will eject the DvD he can see the printed porn pictures and all my repute and respect can dash to nothing but i  also could not refuse him to use my computer as he was very nice to our family. I permitted him to use my computer and when he ejected the DVD he got confused as i was. He did'nt say anything he put that DvD aside, did his work quickly and went away. This fuck up happened to me and i decided not to watch porn again.

My mother in law decided to take a year off of work in order to finish a masters in nursing. During that year, she ran up about $50k in credit card debt. She has an income of about $80k/year and is barely making her minimum payments on her card. I'm trying to convince her to sell her rental house, which would give her about $45k in profit, but any advice is welcome. Are there any other options that we could pursue?

Which sounds odd, but isn't necessarily when you consider one factor: alcohol. 



Basically, I was at a party in one of the flats in my accommodation (I'm at university) and everyone got absolutely wasted to the point where half of us didn't even make it out to the clubs. I downed a bottle of wine and drank another one and a half; my friend downed vodka and got so drunk that we had to put him to bed. Somehow - my memory is fuzzy - i got separated from them and ended up in a different block (I have no memory of this; I've been informed by someone else). My next memory is being sick in some stranger's toilet, then him having sex with me. 



I've no idea who this guy is, and I don't know if I even consented to sex. I remember kissing him, so I must have on some level reciprocated it. However, when he was actually penetrating me, I recall it being painful; I'm not sure if I told him to get off, as all I can remember is drunkenly slurring "do you have a condom?" He informed me he had, but I also vaguely recall (and god, this is mortifying) giving him a blowjob and accidentally scraping my teeth along his dick (he yelped in pain, to which I apologised) multiplying my fear of the condom splitting tenfold. I'm not on any other contraception, as I was a virgin before that. 



After that, another mind-blank -- my next memory is turning up to my friend's flat, saying something about how I was sorry and how he was too strong. Did I mean this? I don't know. My friends went to speak to him about it, and apparently he said something about being a moral person, that he wouldn't lie, etc. I fell asleep on the sofa. 



The next morning, my flatmates implored me to tell them what had happened. I told them all of the above, because my memory is so so fuzzy. They were disgusted, and think that, even if I did initially consent, I was far too drunk to actually consent. I may be inclined to agree with this...but I'm wary of calling him a rapist. A bit scummy, yeah. Supposedly he was fairly lucid and coherent, whereas I was not at all. Hence, that blame is on him. 



They want me to report him to the police, but I'm wary. I'd rather just never see him again. However, I am thinking...this could happen to other girls. Maybe he'll take advantage of them, too? 



I got Plan B today, but as I was informed, it mightn't necessarily work. Consequently, I'm terrified of pregnancy and STDs. 



I'm out again tonight because I don't want to be by myself. But I'm also thinking that, just because I regret it, doesn't make him a rapist. 



I guess I just needed to vent. I'm not sure what to do at this point.

Explain the cosmetic and biological rejuvenation tech advances that will allow senior citizens to pass for college students.



Having volunteered in nursing homes, that advanced aging shit scares me. I don't want any part in looking so fucking old.



Thankfully, I'm young enough to probably see looking like senior citizens get obsolete and become one for the history books. But will someone explain *how?*



How will it be that I'll look the way I was in 2019, in 2079?

Hello,



I applied for a auto loan for $6k at a credit union to buy a car from a private seller and got approved. I wasn't able to talk to the banker because he went home for the day when i tried to reach out to him. but since i was approved will the bank give me the $6k in cash to buy the car? or will it be some other method? just wondering because the person i want to buy the car from wants cash only.

So I'm a fairly normal dude in my late 20s. I Work full time, focusing on building my career and starting a family with my girlfriend that I live with and also share financial obligations with. I have always had a nerdy side I enjoy the occasional fantasy novel, play video games but I don't make it something that consumes my life, I enjoy "normal" social stuff as well. Growing up I bounced around different clicks and could get along with just about anyone but I always felt shameful about my nerdy side....



Anyways I started playing a game in which the main character uses a longsword so I started researching info on longswords (I have a obsessive googleing problem) and before I knew it I learned quite a bit about swords and such. Eventually I ended up ordering a sword for a couple hundred bucks on a website with a shit return policy and it's on its way via ups and I have not told my girlfriend for 2 reasons 



1. Even though we are financially stable we usually talk about purchasing things we don't need.



2. She is for sure gonna roast me for being a man-child



Oh man feels good to get that off my chest



Tl;Dr bought a sword and now scared of girlfriend

I was considering posting this a few days ago, and then I saw the thread about happy songs. It seemed like a good idea to do one for tear-jerkers too.



This song is several years old, but I can't keep myself from tearing up any time I hear it. [Eisley - Memories](https://youtu.be/xewk7OgIrPU)

Unfortunately neither of us are money savvy and despite lurking here for some time I still feel clueless and intimidated by the enormity of the task of tackling this debt.



Timeline:



2017: I'm still in school while he starts work 50k salary for the next 4 years



2019: I start on 50k salary for 3-5 years



2021: His salary increases to about 200k



2023: My salary increases to 150k+



Somewhere in 2018-2019 we'll be getting engaged then married.



His loans: 200k upon graduation, federal loan, 5.6% interest



This huge number is looming over us both and causing quite a bit of anxiety for our future.



My questions:



1. Cost of living will run us about 1k/month in rent, which is about the same as mortgage in one of the nicer suburbs. I'm very nervous about taking on another huge debt when we already have a large student debt to pay off, but renting seems like a waste if it will cost the same as mortgage. If we decide to get a house after saving enough for a downpayment, what are some financial considerations we should know as first time homeowners?



2. 200k on 5.6% interest seems like such a huge number to us. In the long run what is our wisest option for repaying this? A financial advisor suggested income based repayment, but being in debt for the next 25 years sounds crushing. And does IBR mean if you miss or pay late even one payment in the next 25 years, you're no longer eligible to have the remainder forgiven after 25 years?



3. Can you refinance a federal loan like ours for a lower interest rate? Are there any reasons we shouldn't do this?



4. There will be 2 years when he's working and I'm still in school, and the wedding will most likely happen during this time. The price tag on traditional weddings is already making me want to vomit, but it means a lot to both our parents so nor do we want to go completely bare bones and get married at the court house. If anyone has resources for planning tiny weddings (like 20-30 people) please share.



5. Honest opinions: how manageable does our situation look?

It's actually more of a horror/comedy, and goes full Sam Raimi.  It reminded me of the tone that Trick R Treat or the second/third Evil Dead movies struck than anything else.  It's aware of the tropes of the genre, and subverts them.



The "cross-over" from the first movie is minimal, and you can enjoy this one while pretending the other Ouija doesn't exist.  



It doesn't rely on jump scares, and the few times there are those sudden jumps, they're well deserved and/or hilarious.  



Great characters, really solid performances, features a grown up Elliot from ET, and just all around feels really playful, energetic, and frighteningly fun. 



Check out the Official Discussion if you don't believe me, it caught me waaaaay off guard. The most fun I've had at a horror movie since Krampus.

Lately when I look at the night sky I see a lot of moving stars, or at least appear to be stars. Now satellites would be first guess, but on occasion I have seen some clustered together. I wanted to know if any astronomers had any explanations as this phenomenon seems to be a global one, after doing a quick YouTube search. Thanks.

I received a job offer yesterday and I'm having a very difficult time making the "right" decision. To give you an idea of where I'm coming from. I'm in my early thirties, married, with three young children and was medically released from the military after 13 years. 



After a long time spent unemployed and job searching I managed to land a federal ladder position that will end as a GS-11 in two years but start as a GS-7 at the end of the month. I also had to sign an agreement promising to serve within the agency for additional 3 years. As a GS-7 with special pay rates I will be making a gross income of approximately 47k in addition to a tax free 40k pension I receive for my military service. So my annual salary will equate to roughly 87k with 40 of it free from taxes. After the two years it will take me to get to the GS-11 level I will be making around 60k.



Yesterday I received an amazing offer in a better location as a contractor for almost double the salary. I will end up grossing around 125k if you include the 40k pension. As an employee of this organization I will have nearly limitless career advancement opportunities pending an increased skill set and education. The federal position will not allow promotion beyond the GS-11 level until after the 5 year mark. It also does not offer the same amount of job satisfaction that the contracting position will bring. 



I've read numerous online articles and forum postings debating the topic of public vs private sector work, but I'm still having a hard time making the best decision for me and my family. I know federal work provides great benefits (crazy vacation time, paid holidays, 40 hr work weeks, low medical, 401k/TSP/pension and job security). I will also have the option of "buying back" my military time eventually resulting in another pension however, I already receive a pension and nearly free medical for life. 



The contracting position also offers great bennies and 3 day weekends twice a month. The contract is well established with no sight of losing it in the near future, but we all know that can change within a drop of a dime. 



So do I keep the security of the federal gig with low advancement (unless the GS-12/13 retires or dies in 5 years) and walk off from a lot money or accept the offer job for the higher salary and better job satisfaction? If I didn't have a family to support this would be a no-brainer for me, but because of this I'm having a hard time and don't want to regret my decision. My So doesn't want me to decline the contracting position out of fear, but is supportive of my decision either way. 



Any advice or insight into my predicament would be greatly appreciated.

Do I still have to type 300 characters, to get a good conversation going?  Okay.  



In MULHOLLAND DRIVE, halfway through the movie Naomi Watts turns into the other hot lady, or something, but it never loops all the way back to the beginning.  But in LOST HIGHWAY, it starts out with Bill Pullman, flips into the story of Balthazar Getty, then somehow flips right back around to the beginning of the Bill Pullman part.  If you were watching the movie on a loop at a movie theater, you could go in AT ANY TIME, stay and watch things happen, and then leave when you see "This is the part where I came in".  And if you haven't seen Lost Highway, sorry about the [SPOILERS].



PULP FICTION quite famously looped around with the structure, but the framing device of the coffeehouse robbery means it does seem to have a beginning and an end after all.  Oh well. 



So, what other movies have "Mobius loop" plot structures?



PRIMER, perhaps.

There's been a lot of talk and speculation of how Nintendo will go about porting games for the Switch.  Storage and cost are usually the largest issues people bring up.



I feel like I know exactly what Nintendo has up their sleeves.  



Nintendo has been working very closely with Nvidia on this system, and has borrowed quite a bit from what Nvidia has been doing with their Shield line of gaming consoles.  One of the killer-app features of the Shield is Nvidia GeForce Now.  It's a game-streaming service where the actual game is hosted on Nvidia's servers, and streamed to the player's game console.  A monthly subscription fee gets you a library of games to play whenever you want, and there are premium games that you can license on top of that.  They've had some large 3rd party developers, such as Square Enix license games for the service.  I just finished playing through Tomb Raider (2013), and even on my meager 25mb Comcast connection, it had very few hiccups.  The subscription model works great for me because I don't have time to play video games as much as I used to and I can play a variety of games without having to risk the cost of a full game each time.  



My prediction is that we will see a similar service announced by Nintendo just prior to the launch of the Switch where we will have a constantly-growing library of first-party Nintendo games as well as tons of 3rd-party games (likely something from everyone on that list of developers they announced with the trailer).  THIS is how we will get Skyrim.  THIS is how we will get around any storage issues with ports.  This is what Nintendo has up their sleeves for the Switch.

Hi guys. Live concert streams are getting more and more popular. Like yesterday I was just browsing YouTube and found that Martin Garrix was streaming his concert in Amsterdam live. Was glad to find that stream,  cus the video was quickly removed after the live concert. 



I have also watched streams of live concerts like Red hot chili peppers, Rihanna, Chance the rapper, Alicia Keys +++ the last 6 months on Apple music, Tidal,  Red Bull app and YouTube. 



But it's kinda hard to keep up with which artists who are streaming live and on which platform. 



Have searched for any subreddit or thread where people can post live streams they find but can't find any. 



Let me know if u have a site where I can find it or if you want to be a part of a sub where we post links when we find them :)

A teacher asked a student to write 55. 

Student asked: How? 

Teacher: Write 5 and beside it another 5! 

The student wrote 5 and stopped. 

teacher: What are you waiting for? 

student: I don't know which side to write the other 5!

So like a lot of people, I recently saw the new teaser trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2. It's awesome.



Now usually when a new trailer for a game that I'm interested in or curious about comes out, I'm all over it. I'll watch it a few times from day to day, try to pick out the bits and pieces of interest or just generally psych myself up and get excited. And like a lot of gamers, I'll watch the following trailers that come out all the way up until the release and gradually learn more and more about it: Mass Effect: Andromeda, for example, is something that I'm constantly following.



My question for you guys is how have trailers and - as a result -  learning more about the game's story, characters, setting, etc. affected your experience of video games? Has it been for the better? Or do you prefer to shut out all kinds of marketing so you can discover it for yourself upon release? Because the idea of discovering *everything* yourself when you play the game is something that in retrospect I always experienced as a kid playing video games but haven't had since I discovered the internet.

A pretty simple question... I've been curious! If an employer matches up to 8% pre-tax, and I've chosen to contribute 8% post-tax, do they tend to match off of the % so I'm fully matched, or would they go off of the dollar amount, meaning I'm not maxing out their match?



(I was advised to switch from pre-tax to post so that I can put more away for a house down payment.)

Previously I've not been the best when it comes to credit and my credit score is ruined (my own fault, yes.) but financially I'm a bit better off now, I'm working 50 hours a week etc.. But I still can't get credit (even for a cheap mobile contract). 



My question is how the hell are you supposed to make it better if you've previously abused it? 



I feel I trust myself better now when it comes to money so would like to start building my rating up now for the future, maybe it's too late?

I'm looking for minimal but atmospheric techno albums similar to Microgravity by Biosphere. Something that has dance floor aspect with emphasis on fat, mesmerizing bass, but has nice textures and cold atmosphere too. Crude and hypnotic techno. Tech house will do also, but nothing too polished please.

*Edit*: In NYC





I'm a freelance consultant & software developer.  I know that I can deduct miles driven to my clients as well as money spent on food & gas spent with them.



However over the past 8 months I have also worked on a side project for which I've established a separate LLC.  I am not paid for this time & there is no 'client' per-se.  However I drive a similar distance & spent similar money on gas & food. Not to mention servers, software, etc.  Can I deduct that as a business expense?  



If not, since there are two separate LLCs, if one paid the other an amount of money (even a nominal one) would that be sufficient to show that business is being conducted?

Hi r/diy! I am replacing some coat hooks from a shelf that originally have threads for regular logs (don't know how else to word that). They go into the shelf on one side and is fastened with a back piece on the other side. 



I found almost identical coat hooks but they have wood threads at the end, made to screw directly into the wood.



What I'm wondering is if there are some kind of back pieces or logs for wood threads? If not, how would you guys solve this?



I have tried google, but with no results.



Please excuse me if this is the wrong place for this question, and please point me in the right direction!



*edit: changed coat hangers to coat hooks.

Like most fuck ups on this page, this actually happened about 3 days ago.



 I was sitting in class and listening to the amazing album Toxicity by System of a Down. As I'm listening to the song Toxicity I hear how amazing that song is. I decided I would find the drum sheet music for it so I can go home and learn this song. I then get home and start practicing the song. At first it was really hard for me since it's really fast paced but I quickly caught on to it. A big thing to know about me is that I rage when I play. I throw sticks and kick stuff over,  I'm destructive when I play. As I'm playing along with the song I finally nail the intro but mess up an important fill. This sends me into RAGE! I stand up and hurl a drum stick across the room and start kicking stuff. I heard a big bang and looked up... My drum stick had completely destroyed by big flatscreen tv. My rage quickly turned into regret. I'm now hoping no one in my house goes downstairs and find what I did before I find a way to explain it. 



TL;DR: Wanted to learn a song on drums. Ended up destroying my TV in the process.

My game is called Dot Swap, and It's been a few hours since my game's been published on the Google Play Store. Here's a screenshot of the Google Play Dev Console: [click](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzkj84fbefa7sxv/devconsole.PNG?dl=0)



Here's a screenshot of the screen when I click the 'view in play store' link: [click](https://www.dropbox.com/s/way02q6lg6mzs80/playstore.PNG?dl=0)



And of course it's no where to be seen when I search for it... Does anyone have any idea what's happening?

I understand that sugar, though to some degree necessary in the diet for optimal health, is bad for you in excess. High sugar intake is apparently related to heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions. Fruit, however, is considered good for you, because of the many vitamins and minerals they provide. Fruit is also high in sugar (fructose?). Is this sugar still bad for you? How do the benefits of its nutrients and consequences of sugar compare to each other?

Hi all, im 27yo, I make good money at my job but my employer is slowly starting to shift away its pension for its retirees and I fear that soon it will be cut entirely in favor of an extra 401k match instead.



I fully fund my Roth IRA every year, I put in 5% to my 401k and they match up to 3%, but if in the unforeseen future should they lump sum out my pension or cut it before my 5 years vestment at this employer, should I be bumping my 401k contribution up to compensate for that possibility? I've read that most advisors consider the pension a bonus but at the rate it would pay out if my employer decides to keep it, it would be a healthy payout on a monthly basis.



Thanks

**Facility Log**





**Monday 10/17/16**- 4 AM: Today is my first day back since the.. uh, incident that happened last week. It's been uneventful, as it would happen both my co-worker and I are a bit less excited for the facility walks. During our first facility walk we discovered nothing out of the usually, although we did steer clear of the area of the building where we had the unpleasant experience that seems so fresh in my mind.





**Wednesday 10/19/16**- 5 AM: My co-worker and I have decided to enter the decrepit part of the facility, we have no choice due the fact that there seems to be a door open in that part of the facility. I wince as we pull the double-doors to the forgotten facility open, the smell of fresh and cool October air hits my nostrils and brings my nerves and my guard down. We pass through the doors that almost seem like a gateway to a different dimension. I flip the light switch, nothing happens. "Huh, that's odd. These worked less than a week ago." We pull out our mag lights, the click of our buttons is audible but no light emits from the flashlight. We pull our phones from our pockets only to find that they aren't working as well. A sudden flicker and suddenly everything comes to life, our flashlights, the florescent bulbs and the pinging of incoming messages vocalize from our devices. The door to the offices comes open slightly and then closes. We close the garage door that was left ajar and go back to our offices without any event.





**Friday 10/21/16**- 4:30 AM: An odd fixation to inspect the empty facility overcomes us, we wonder back into the place that we've had so many experiences. We find nothing out of the ordinary and we head back to our office. My co-worker excuses himself to the restroom and I continue my work on the facility log and a few signs that need to be posted throughout the facility. An email comes through, it's from my co-worker in the restroom. It's five pages of signs with the attached message to print them. I do exactly that. My co-worker comes back from the bathroom "I printed those signs that you wanted posted." He tilts his head in confusion. "I didn't send you anything to print, I haven't even drafted the signs yet." He lifts the freshly printed signs from the industrial printer. "Uhhhhh, you should look at this." I walk over to the printer and take a look at the signs, the first sign was normal. "Do not leave doors open." every sign after was far from normal, each with the message. "It watches" and a shadowy figure hidden behind the message. "Is this your idea of a sick joke, you dingus? This isn't a thing that we should joke about." He looks at me devoid of all emotion and flush of color, "I didn't make these at all, this isn't something I'm just having a joke about. I know nothing about these."



**Saturday 10/22/16**- 5 AM: I work alone tonight, my co-worker is enjoying the day off and I'm here writing this facility log. A open canvas for me to compose my thoughts and events of the night. My co-worker walks into the room, "What are you doing here?" I ask him. "Just collecting some stuff that I left in my locker." He grabs a few trinkets from his locker tells me to have a good rest of my shift and leaves. I notice that he's left his keys here and text him teasingly that he won't be able to drive home without them. He calls me back "What the hell are you talking about? I've been home all night." I freeze in total confusion. "Do you have your car keys with you? I ask him. "Of course you dunce, my car is parked out front." I ask him to check anyway. "I can't find my keys anywhere, but my car is still out front.. hold on, it's on right now. The lights are on." I scramble for the keys on my desk and find that they indeed have my co-workers beloved school grad keychain on them. I inform him that his keys are with me. "Impossible, my car is running out front" He walks out to his car to see if anyone is in it, the second he opens the door it shuts off. He informs me that no one is in the car and his keys are no where to be found. The call goes silent and the phone call drops.

So Ive had my car almost 2 years now, but it seems like I have been upside down since I left the lot. Bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic last Febuary for 9600 or so abouts. I put $2500 down and I pay $199.24. I have only been late twice. Other than that all on time payments usually made before my due date.



But I find myself in the predicament of needing a bigger car now, so to trade it of course I need the payoff balance. Its currently about 7300 right now. I just need advice on what to do in this situation.

I was driving around my campus, which has many, many stop signs, with crosswalks at each one. Me being a courteous person, I usually allow the people to cross in front of me. I pulled up to one such crosswalk, and I see someone waiting to walk across. We do the quick "You go, no you go" as is custom, before she folds and begins to walk. This is where I fuck it up. I want to make sure that I don't move the car as to not hit her. She's walking pretty close to the car, and it wouldn't be pleasant. However, I go to press down on the brake pedal, my foot slips from the brake to the gas, and I accelerate very rapidly. Thankfully, all I manage to do run over her foot, which she was surprisingly forgiving about, but I shudder to think what would have befallen had I been a second later.

I'm 16 and I just feel like everyone else was raised better than me.  It's like people just have a better control of their emotions and the way they think and have an understanding of how the world works.  I feel really hopeless.  I just dont understand how im supposed to function in this world.  I don't know what I want from life or how to get it.  I'm just really confused.  I dont even really know or understand what hard work is.  What I'm saying makes sense in my head but I'm struggling to type it out here, I can try to explain better if anybody wants lol.



Idk I'm just struggling with life

Let's make something clear here. I might be in college, but I'm a shy, quiet man. Quite idiotic to be frank, since I'm studying law in the hopes of becoming an attorney at a non-profit in order to push criminal justice reform. On top of that, I work at a social work organization on campus known as "The Center for Servant Leadership", where student coordinators organize community service events and recruit students on campus to participate in such events. As someone living in Texas, I'm sick and tired of hearing how our state is so pathetically behind other states in the US in terms of education quality, lifestyle, etc. And so, I joined the organization as a Voter Registration Coordinator, in the hopes to get college age students to learn the importance of voting and actually registering to vote.



Now, as a shy guy, you can imagine how mortified I was when I learned that I was he only male in the 13-member group. Yep. 12 women, 1 man. 



"Great! More shy, quiet moments that I'll remember about college. As if that hasn't happened to me before." 



Surprisingly, however, all 13 of them were rather cute and beautiful in their own way. But one of them caught my eye- Abby. See, whereas I was a senior, she was a Sophomore. I was Latino, she was White. I wasn't exactly the hottest guy on school, whereas for me, she was beautiful in every way. Her short, smooth blonde hair. Her glasses. Her body. Her piercing blue eyes and laugh that would make me smile even when I felt down. Everything about her was perfection. Until the horrifying mistake I did.



I guess I should introduce myself. The names' Sal. I attend a small, liberal arts university in a rural town in Texas. Our library is open 24/6, Granted, I am notorious to be the only one in the library past midnight; I enjoy working on my homework late in the wee hours of the morning. Even though it remains open, there is nobody at the help desk to help. The library consists of a basement, the main floor, and the second floor. Me being the one who enjoys the concept of dead silence and loneliness, I made my way to the basement and situate myself to write my 10 page paper due in a few days. 2 pages, and nearly 2 hours later, movement caught the corner of my eye. Started and mortified, I quickly shift my eyes to see what had moved. It was Abby. She too, came to the library at nearly 2 in the morning to work on her homework.



"Hi, Sal! It's nice to run into somebody this late at night in such an eerie setting... mind if I sit at your table and work on my homework?"



"No, ma'am", I replied. "I'd enjoy some company right now, that's for sure. If I keep writing essays this late at night, I might go insane".



She laughed. God, that laugh. It's so loud, yet beautiful and innocent in a way. I would glance at her every once in a while, trying to decipher what the reflection of her crystal blue eyes was showing me. 



A good 50 minutes had passed, and it was nearly 3AM, when I decided to suck up my courage and tell her my feelings towards her. It was just us two- what could possibly go wrong?



"Hey... Abby?" Her eyes peeked up at me, that warm smile piercing through my soul. "I... I've been meaning to tel you something." Her warm smile slightly flinched.



"F-From the moment I met you for the first time, I had thought of you as somebody special. You are incredibly passionate, intelligent, and care for the well being of others, like myself. You are a hardworking, intelligent woman who knows how to take care of herself. But most of all, you are you. You're a beautiful soul in and out." 



Her warm smile was a poker face at this point. "She's just as stubborn with boys as I am with women", I thought.



"W-Would you like to hangout sometime, and maybe... watch a m-movie together?", I stuttered. Light from her laptop reflecting from her eyes, I could tell they were no longer warm. Her poker face disappeared into that of a neutral face.



Nervous to look at her again, I shifted my eyes to my laptop. "You... you..." she stuttered. Her warm voice was replaced with that of a hellish one. She practically sounded like a serial killer. "You...", she kept repeating. At this point, I was packing my laptop into my backpack, terrified of even looking at her. 



"Is this how women act when someone they have no interest in-"



"**RUN**". **RUN**." It wasn't that she said to run, but the way she said it- that terrified me. It was like her beautiful laughter, only it echoed through the basement like a million demon voices speaking at one. The lights in the basement began to flicker on and off. I was beyond terrified. **THREE STRIKES... RUN**. I had never exited a library quicker than I did that moment. 



At this point, the entire library, as well as all the buildings and light post across campus, had lost power. Only the occasional peek of moonlight illuminated the path to my dorm. Problem is, it's a straightway and rather far. "**R**... **U**...", I faintly heard behind me. I refused to look at Abby- whatever it was, and took off like my life depended on it. "**N**..."



A group of students not far from me caught my attention. They seemed to be walking towards their dorms-the same building I lived in. Somehow, someway, I caught up with them. 

"H-Hi. Y-you..", i said panting. 



"Sal?!" Abby.



 She turned around, and faced me. She looked at me, startled and perplexed. I backed away slowly from the group. It was her, alongside a few of the ladies that I work with "No. No. NO. NO NO NO NO NO", my mind screamed. I had JUST seen her at the library! How the hell did she manage to catch up with this group of students when they were CLEARLY in my POV the entire time??!



"*Manitou*". "*Manitou*", Abby said. She might be white, but as far as I knew, she also had Native American ancestry in her. I assumed she was speaking in native tongue."*Manitou*", she said again.



Our friends and I looked at her perplexed. 

"Inside the building. NOW", she demanded. 



We ran into the building, and into our own rooms. Thing is, a giant window that is on the front of my room that looks outside is the same area where Abby and I were standing. Curious to look out, I begin to open the blinds. 



"DON'T", I hear in front of me. Startled and terrified, I shut the blinders tight and rely on the weak shadow I see of Abby reflecting due to moonlight through the blinds. Silence. Nothing but dead silence. She hasn't moved a muscle. It became so quiet, I could hear her breathing. I could tell make out her breathing through her faint shadow through the blinders. 



She turns at a 90 degree angle- and faces my window. Startled but silent, I back up slowly. She takes a few steps towards my window, and stops right in front of it. Her silhouette was still visible through the blinders. Mortified, I retreat to my bed and cover my face. She's still there- or at least I hope it's still her. 



*knock knock*. Someone was at my door. Having nearly suffered a stoke, I back slowly towards the door while keeping an eye on the silhouette to see who it was. Abby. It was Abby again. 



"W-WHAT?!", I exclaimed mentally. 

"NO. SHE'S STILL OUTSIDE. SHE TOLD ME NOT TO LOOK."

I peaked through my door's eye viewer to see who it was. It was definitely Abby. And she was holding a strange handcrafted object that resembled a wind chime in her hand.



I turn back to the blinders only to realize that there was no moonlight- no silhouette. Mortified, I turn back to the Abby by the door. She hangs the mysterious object near my door, and walks away.



Without moonlight, and being too scared to even peek through my blinds, I decide to hop into bed and sleep. As my eyes shut, I could make out the noise of heavy breathing coming from the window. I ignore it, and fall asleep. 



It is morning right now of the following day, and Abby has come over to my room to "check up on me". She's here with me right now, but I am unsure as to whether to trust her or not in what she does in my room. She seems to be... well, herself... but after last night... I am unsure.



**R**

Hi /r/personalfinance, I've got a problem on my hands. I went to a local ER back in March, where they didn't ask for my insurance and I assumed that, because I go to this hospital frequently and they already had a lot of my other information on hand, they already had it on file. The insurance they attempted to file to was an old insurance, though, and they turned around and put the account into collections. Like, immediately. It took me a while of going back and forth with the hospital and my insurance to finally get my current insurance billed. So mistake #1: assuming that they already had the correct info. 



My insurance is also under my dad's employment, and for most of the past year I've been in a situation where I've had to live with my partner's family, but I still have to receive my mail at my dad's house. My dad brings me my mail once a week, but he often loses pieces of mail and I don't receive them until like, a month or more later. Mistake #2: not being vigilant enough about getting my mail on time.



Shortly after I confirmed that my current insurance was billed, I called my insurance to ask if they had paid it. The customer service representative I spoke to made it sound as though the entire thing was paid and that I wouldn't have to pay anything myself. So it was a little surprising when, having not received any bills or any other calls from collections and being under the impression that my insurance had paid it all, I got this derogatory mark on my credit report.



Here's why I'm asking about disputing it: I immediately contacted my insurance, who informed me that they had paid most of it and all I had left to pay was $400. BUT the collections account is asking for $1000. My insurance has mailed me an "explanation of benefits" detailing exactly how much I owe, which is $400, not $1000. I can easily pay $400 now. Shit, I can pay $1000 off within 2-3 paychecks.  So can I dispute this bill for being the incorrect amount? If I dispute it for this reason and pay it off, will it be removed completely from my credit report?

And this redhead comes in. After checking out a few items, the redhead sees what looks like an extremely old dollar coin selling for $15,000. The redhead takes a very close look at the coin and sees that it is a fake. She goes up to the blond and tells him about this, and he dismisses her. 



She responds, "I've got a Ph.D in American Studies. I could expose this shop and it would really affect you." He goes inside to discuss this with his wife, then comes back and says, "Alright, thanks for letting me know. You can take any item of your choice for nothing, just don't mention about the coin to anyone. I'll need your card so that I can charge it the minimum amount." It's a deal. She comes back with a set of coins worth $120,000, and he 'charges' her card. She leaves.



He goes back in to meet his wife. She asks,  "Do you really think this was a great idea?" He responds, "Yeah, she's gonna get crushed by the tax."

I want to get into Half Life.  I've heard Half Life 2 is amazing, but I don't hear a lot about the first Half-Life.  Is it worth or necessary to play?  Or should I jump in on HL2?

I tried sewing them and it made it look hideous.



Normally I wouldn't care and wear them at home but it's an expensive designer brand so I can't just trash it out.

I decided to get in shape by going to the local gym. I said to the trainer "Which machine should I use for best results in attracting women." He said "There`s one outside never fails, it`s called an ATM."

The way I see it, self awareness is really the basis of all our current intelligence, and we can't really comprehend anything more advanced than that when it comes to our own consciousness. Maybe if you're an alien and intelligent enough, there's another way of thinking about intelligence beyond awareness?

I know that David Bowie's been exhausted on this thread, but can we just talk about one of his underrated albums? Like, severely underrated?



Outside follows a concept:



**MURDER IN ART**



It stars many different characters, such as:



Nathan Adler, Algeria Touchshriek, Leon Blank, Ramona. A Stone and many more.



It tells an intricate story of Nathan Adler, a professional detective, trying to figure out as to what the hell went wrong with the world and as to why this new **ART CRIME** has sweeped across the nation and if he could put a stop to it.



Sadly, the story was never finished due to David Bowie's untimely demise in 2016. May he rest in peace.



It propelled Bowie back into the spotlight, but it's not talked about much in the fandom.



Well, what do you people think about it?

Hello everyone,



A look at our solar system, hundreds of years from now. Mars is terraformed and inhabited by us. I hope I am not breaking any rules here by posting this but it is so awesome to fly through space. Especially when it is in a realistic space simulator like this.

I guess Kim Kardashian's ass transformed, and took the form of a DDoS attack.



After all, she DID say she would "break the internet".

Little Susie lay on hear bed wide awake. She used to be able to fall asleep in spite of any disturbance.  But things had changed once “It” had shown up. Today there was a thunderstorm raging outside. The darker the night was, the higher were the chances of “It” showing up. She had seen the thing for the first time about 3 months back. Her mother had moved from their previous home so that she could be closer to her new boyfriend. Susie had hated moving out from their old home. She had to leave all of her friends and not to mention the memories of her dad also. Their old home had been the last place where her father had spent time with her before suddenly disappearing. 





Susie remembered that day clearly, she had just come home from school. She saw her dad sitting near the coffee table speaking to his mother in a loud voice. They usually spoke in loud voices, so it was not new to her that they were making a big ruckus. But today seemed different. It always started with loud voices, and slowly the voices came down, but today they kept growing. She had to run to her room and lock the door and close her ears as hard as she could. She thought if she went out after a couple of hours everything would be ok. She started searching where her father was. Her mother came over to her, hugged her and said “Daddy is hiding somewhere far. He will come back when the time is right”. It had been 6 months since then; her dad had yet not shown up.  Over that time her mother had changed, she didn’t want to play anymore with Susie. She refused to give her any attention and behaved violently when Susie tried to cheer her up.





Around 3 months back, when Susie came back from school she saw her mother talking to someone and laughing. It had been a while since her mother had smiled. Susie was happy that her mother was happy again. Maybe this meant that she would play with her again. Her mother came over to her and said, “Susie! This is Ryan. He really wanted to meet you”. Ryan smiled at Susie and said, “Hi there Sweetie! You are much cuter than your mother said!” Susie was confused. She knew that her father was going to come back anytime soon, and he hated it when her mother invited her friends to spend time with her. Last time he had gotten really angry when her friend was talking with her mom in their bedroom. If he saw Ryan this time, she would be even angrier.





That night after Ryan had left; Susie tried to reason with her mother asking her to make Ryan to leave.  She explained how her dad might not like him being here. Her mother just grabbed her by the arm and whispered menacingly, “Your father is not coming back. And you will not follow in his footsteps and mess with my happiness. I have suffered enough for this family and Ryan makes me happy, you will not do anything to screw up our relationship. You understand?” Susie shook her head in agreement with tears in her eyes. Her mother was really angry and why did she say that her father would not return back?  Her mother had changed a lot since her father left.

	Everything became even worse when, they had to move to Ryan’s house. It was so far away from her school, this meant that she would have to go to a new school and make new friends. As much as she hated it, she could not bring herself to tell her mother this. Her mother would just yell at her even more. Ryan was smiling that day, when he saw them driving into the neighborhood with all their stuff. Somehow to Susie his smile was evil. But it could have just been her imagination, because of how upset she was right now. As Ryan walked them through the house, Susie was just looking slightly uncomfortable. It felt like something was here. Something that was watching her every move. But all she could see was Ryan and her mother looking at her.





“I was asking do you like your new room Sweetie?” Ryan said. “Answer him, when he asks you something!” Her mother snapped. “Now, now, there is no reason to yell at her honey. Its ok Susie. Take your time to get adjusted here. Get comfortable in your new room; let me know if you need anything.” Ryan said as he smiled at Susie. Her mother smiled awkwardly, and said “I hope she has not upset you I anyway. She is just getting used to the new place” Susie felt a warmth in Ryan’s smile and yet some coldness behind it. 





She began unpacking her stuff and setup everything, still she felt like something was in the walls looking at her at all times. She felt a chill down her spine. This place was somehow making her uneasy. Behind the bright pink walls and the fluffy bed, it felt like there was something much more sinister in it. It was like the brightly colored walls hid the darkness of the place.





She had felt “It”’s presence as soon as she had move in. That night as she lay in her bed, she heard someone open the door. It was a large hooded figure. It just stood in the corner of the room and kept whispering to itself. Susie was scared. She wanted to yell, but she was scared that “It” would attack her if she did. “It” came closer and whispered Susie’s name a few times in her ear. The voice sounded so weird and yet so familiar. She felt like she had heard this voice already. She yelled as loud as she could, and hid her face under the blankets. After a few minutes, her mother rushed into the room and tried to calm her down. “Its ok Susie. Its ok.” She said “Its just me and Ryan. Tell me what happened”. Susie told her mother how a dark hooded figure had appeared in her room suddenly and had kept making hushed noises. The color drained from her mother’s face. She looked at Ryan, who was covered in sweat himself. She stood up silently, and walked out telling Susie that it was nothing but a bad dream. Ryan walked behind her asking her to talk to her about something, but she kept walking. After sometime Susie had somehow fallen asleep, but she still felt that someone was looking at her.





The next day morning, Susie woke up and found herself with just a blanket and her bed smelling weird. She asked her mother what happened, her mother simply explained that Susie had wet the bed after nightmare last night. And how she had to get Susie out of those wet clothes so that she wouldn’t catch a cold.  Susie felt embarrassed, it had been a long time since she had wet the bed. What Second-grader still wets the bed now? If any of her new friends came to know of this, they would make fun of her. She begged her mother to not tell anyone about it. Her mother looked at her and said “Don’t worry, nobody will know Sweetie. Its our little secret.”  She smiled. Susie felt that her mother looked wired and yet agitated about something. Susie had the same expression whenever she did anything wrong. Was her mother not telling her about something? Susie asked her about the monster that she had seen in her room yesterday night and how it seemed too real to be a dream. “There are no things called monsters” Her mother snapped ”Make sure not to tell this to anyone, People would laugh if they heard that a second grader still believed in monsters. Now be silent! Ryan is still sleeping, And I don’t want you to upset him in anyway”





That night a couple of hours after Susie had gone to bed, “It” had returned. Susie saw it from the corner of her eyes. “It” was poking through the walls for something. What was it looking for? But she still made sure not to make any noise, to prevent from getting any attention. “It” moved to the corner of the room and sat down this time. Susie could hear its raspy breath from under its hood. She thought about what her mother had said, there are no such things called as monsters. Maybe it was just her imagination. She just closed her eyes and tried to go back sleep again.





She woke up the next day with her bed wet again, she also felt pain throughout her body this time. Her mother said she had wet the bed again and nothing else. She got Susie ready and gave her an some medicine to help with the pain. This strange occurrence went on for another couple of months.





The thunder shook Susie from her train of thought, she was jolted back to the present. She had decided to confront “It” today and prove to her mother that “It” was real. She decide to act like she was sleeping, but she kept her eyes open halfway the entire time. And as expected, “It” showed up from the darkness of the hallway. “It” went about poking at the walls first. The lightning that night made something in the wall shine. Was it a camera? Why did “It” have a camera, and why was it able to pull it out of her walls? “It” then again went into the corner, waiting with a raspy breath. But today Susie would not fall asleep, she was ready. She had hid a flashlight in her bed, she whipped it out and shined it at “It”. As “It” shielded its eyes from the sudden brightness, Susie yelled for her mother. She yelled saying that she had captured “It”. Her mother rushed into the room and grabbed the flashlight from her hands. Susie saw that “It” looked like Ryan. Why was Ryan dressed like “It”? Why was he in her room at night and why did he have a camera in his hand. Her mother switched off the flashlight and said “I told you there no such things as monsters. Now,” She nodded towards Ryan, who was wearing a dark hoodie ”Be quiet. I don’t want you to upset Ryan in anyway” She said as she closed the door behind her. In the darkness Ryan whispered “Hi Sweetie….” in the same raspy tone. Susie thought of calling for help, But her mother was right, people would never believe if a child said that she saw a monster in her room. But Susie did not know what else to call him. It wouldn’t matter in the end,  its not like anyone would believe her anyway. Even her mother didn’t.

I grew up in Las Vegas, and my dad would tell me about his love for the Dodgers and what it was like to see Kirk Gibson hit his home run in 1988. Since I was a boy, I've always romanticized the Dodgers and the game of baseball. We never had a professional baseball team in LV so the Dodgers were the closest we could get to hometown comraderie. Why do you love your favorite team?
