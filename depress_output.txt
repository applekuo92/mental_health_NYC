Good quote by Robin Williams. Story of my life basically. I'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head.

I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 



Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we "to cool off," and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 



Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 





EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you.

The best explanation I could come up with when a friend of mine asked. 



EDIT: I'm glad so many of you could relate. Keep on fighting to find your home.

Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.



I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.



Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys.

I was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, I wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far I've come. Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.



I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014.

It has taken me an uncountable number of hours to work up the motivation to do this but I feel that it will be both useful for me theraputically while also maybe useful to others. I'm a 23 year old male who is currently unemployed and living with my parents. I graduated highschool just fine and actually was accepted into the University of Washington where I attended for 2 years before dropping out. Immediately afterwords, I began a journey of employeement at a T-Mobile call center for a couple years. I lived on my own or with roommates from the time I was 18 till I was 23. A series of very unfortuante events and decision making errors have led me to where I am now...with my parents and unemployeed and severely depressed.









I was diagnoised with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) when I was 16, and I had signs of it around 15, so I have been struggling with this shit for a long time. About 8ish years I think. It feels like an an entire lifetime in itself. My parents have spent thousands and thousands of dollars trying to help me navigate through the clusterfuck shitshow that is mental illness treatment. I have seen ~8 therapists, ~6 differnt general doctors, and been prescribed a whole pharmacy worth of medications that have varied amounts of success and failures over the years. I think I'm getting pretty close to around 20 total prescribed drugs for this, not including the 130 different drugs I self medicated with from 20-22...but that's a whole other story in itself. 





But this is not about me as an individual...it's about the illness as a whole. Probably one of the most misunderstood and stigmatized illnesses there is, it's incredibly difficult to talk about openly without people getting frustrated or angry or even accusatory with your feelings because they cannot rationalize how someone could think that way. Analogous to someone with a brain tumor trying to describe to someone without one what that 'feels' like...it's not fully possible and nobodies asking non-depressed people to understand, we are asking for empathy. Nobody should have to understand this illness. 











Nobody gives a fuck about depression until someone kills themselves. It's a harsh sentiment but it's true. This is why it's so important to promote education about chronic depression and the realities that it creates for individuals. Everytime someone kills themseleves, people are astonished, dumbfounded....How could this seemingly happy person have given up and felt a suffering so intense that it overcame their fear of death? To anyone who has chronic depression has encountered the abyss that is your mind when you're having an episode, it's obvious how that could push someone over the edge. 





The other harsh reality is that very rarely does someone just kill themself without first asking for help, even if subtley. Severe depression takes a long time and a lot of unforutnate events to manifest into suicidal ideations. Nobody as a young kid looks at themselves in the mirror and says "I hate this life so much and i am such a burden to others that i no longer want to be alive". The thought would never occur to them. So what happened? How did our happy little child in this scenerio end up hanging from a balcony? 









These are difficult situations and concepts to talk about. But that's the problem...nobody is talking about them. You didn't notice your friends or family members suicidal ideations because you weren't looking for them. You don't have the illness yourself so you could never rationalize how someone could take their own life when they seem to have so much to live for. But don't blame yourself either...It's not your fault. It's nobodies fault other than society as a whole for misunderstanding and refusing to accept it as a major problem and also depressions fault for being such a sneaky fuck. Even after a suicide however it's still very hush hush because it's such an uncomfortable scenerio for all remaining loved ones and people who knew them. 









I fucking hate the word depression. I hate describing myself as depressed to anyone who doesn't intimately know me because there is so much stimga to that word because of people misusing it or misapplying it. Depression is NOT being sad all the time, depression is NOT the feeling of grief after a close relative/friend dies, it is not the feeling of crushing loss when your sigificant other breaks up with you. Those are all events where it makes rational sense to feel sad and despair. It's natural to feel alone after a break up. It's a shitty thing that we all deal with in life. Depression, as an illness, actually very rarely has anything to do with feeling sad. Every individual is different but my depression is rooted strongly in hopelessness and lonliness. 



What the difference is, I feel these emotions all the time, dibilitatingly strongly and for NO apparent reason. Great things can be happening in my life, I can have all the friends in the world, but I still sometimes can't get out of bed because I feel so physically exhausted from the intense grip of hopelessness that I cannot rationlize the source. I'm a different person, lost in the void of intrusive thoughts that tell me over and over again that nothing I do matters and that I'm useless. To give you some perspective on how powerful these thoughts are, think about that light bulb moment when you finally realize the answer to something you were thinking about for a while. Or if someone explains something to you and it "clicks" and you go "YAY I GET IT"...that's the same level of psychological power that those intrusive thoughts have on me. The sensations of truth when I feel the hopelessness are so powerful it's analogous to trying to tell yourself that the sky is not blue or you don't need to breath to survive. It's extremely difficult to overcome thinking that has become so poisioned that it's now apart of your framework...it's part of what makes you, you. 







Add to that bullshit an augmentated illness such as in my case GAD(Generalized Anxiety Disorder) so now you have all these feelings of hopelessness and that nothing has meaning, but now we get anxious about not accomplishing anything. Which than makes me feel more useless and more of a failure which decreases the liklihood of me doing anything which furthers the anxiety and you can begin to see what a clusterfuck of a negative feedback loop that this creates. Other individuals dealt even unluckier hands have combos of depression, anxiety, ocd, add, bipolar...ect. You get the point. It's not a good hand to be dealt at all. Combine all of those tragic coping mechanisms with some life tragedies and some shitty, well intentioned but misguided support from those who care about you and you have yourself a bit of a clusterfuck. It begins to make sense why our innocent undamaged child from the scenario is now hanging from a balcony.

**Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase "persecution complex" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**



After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  



If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click "report" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks. 



***************************************************************************



We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to "save" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a "community" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.



**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is "notorious" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish "religion".  So our issue is fundamentally not with religion, but the misuse of it.**

Edit: oh gosh ! I didn't expect to see so many responses on this. I really am truly sorry for everyone who feels like this. There are so many supportive people on this subreddit and reading what some of you guys wrote really made me feel wonderful. Thank you <3

People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 





I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.



But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.



Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Some days I'm pretty okay. Well, not really okay. It's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on Netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. It keeps my mind off of things. It keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. It's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. And that in itself is a massive fucking success.

Throughout the day I'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up. I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'



When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 



This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat "steak." It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. 



I don't really know why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just sick of talking to myself. This somehow seems a little better. That might be another delusion...

It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 



At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, "who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 



It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.



Edit: I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down. Recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart. 



*"The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life."*



I know it's far fetched but it applies for me today.

When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.



EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.



"Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.



And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.



But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 



So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 



It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.



At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?



You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.



By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.



When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape."



EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.



"...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing."

About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program "depression.exe" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.



So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.



The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.



The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.



Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.



It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 



Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.



Edit: Thanks so much for the positive response guys. I've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had :)

Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.



Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.



A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. 



Depression isn't an emotion. Depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life.

Thanks, depression. I *knew* isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful, and yet I did it anyway because I felt I didn't have a choice. Now that I put myself in this position, even my small group of friends that "understand what I'm dealing with" or know what's going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely, and I know it's really not their fault, but it still hurts when I see the pictures or hear about it in passing. I know I can't expect people to still invite me to things when I always decline, especially now when the days that I feel up to being around other people are few and far between. The (anti)social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of.

I feel like after years of being depressed I've become worse at everything I try to do, I used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me. When I'm studying I'l forget everything and even when I'm focused on reading I almost feel like I'm just staring at a blank page. 



No matter what I do I can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more I feel like I'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting.

Sorry if this is the wrong place. I don't think suicide watch is the proper place since I don't necessarily want to commit suicide. I just want to cease living.



I feel like no matter what I can't escape the demons I have. No matter how well I'm doing, my mind is always like "the fuck? Get back in line." No matter what, they'll always come back up and I'll be in my room alone at nearly 2 in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me.



Even then it doesn't even really matter if they're mad or not. I'd be dead.



**Edit to add: Thank you everyone for responding. You all truly helped calm me down. Now that I've gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights, I feel better.**



**That too, has passed. This too, shall pass.**



**If ANY of you need an ear, or a digital shoulder to digitally cry on, I'd love to be there for you. Shoot me a PM anytime.**

It appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to "save" them after they've posted here.  Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click "report" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.



We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take "supportive" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:



 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.



 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.



If you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  We all get more out of it that way.  



**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  In those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.  Don't forget that if you need help and don't feel safe posting, you're always welcome to message the moderators.

Proof:



* The majority of food I eat daily is greens (mostly just spinach and kale)



* I have low-no sex drive (due to antidepressants)



* I sit/lay around most of the day



* People care more about me staying alive than I do 





I honestly don't know if this funny, sad, or somewhere in between.

I've recently come to terms with my depression. Ive contemplated suicide, but i don't think I will ever do it. But every day, when I'm driving to school, I have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me. I think that's just an excuse for my selfish desire to die. I think it would be better for my family. The memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved. I would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issues. They would just say it was an unfortunate accident. Does anyone else think like this?

I would probably never commit suicide although Ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things.  somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems.

My wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this. It might be to prevent others from doing this, but I think it is a more selfish desire to just say it  



I found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about 7-10 days because the side effects were unbearable. I don't mean to diminish this, but I believe it was mostly in her head. She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  



She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was. 



Now I feel trapped. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but I also don't see suicide as an option. How can I put my loved ones through what I'm now going through? I can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct. 





Edit: thank you all for your support. I promise that, despite the timing of this, it is not an April's fool joke. I really wish it was. 



Edit 2: thank you again for all the support. I'm going to see someone today and Friday. The funeral is tomorrow. It's going to be a rough few days.

The tough love ideologues are really getting out of control. I don't know where they are coming from. They are mostly idiots who are short on life experience and common sense, and long on hubris and a sense of entitlement. Many posts here lately receive comments that are just nasty in tone, and extremely judgmental, harsh and condescending in content. 



We really need the mods to crack down on this. I also request that you strongly emphasize that tough love has no place here. I understand that you say that on the sidebar. But I request that you say so in a more prominent place and in a more conspicuous manner. 



There are suicidal folks here whose lives may hang in the balance.



I strongly urge the mods to do something before somebody harms themselves after being publicly shamed in the name of tough love.



I think it's about time that we disempower the tough love acolytes and send them back to their Dr Phil reruns.

*Edit: My use of "triggering" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*



It angers me to see posts saying "If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now." In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?





When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] "I'd be sad if you died," I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, "Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down." Depression isn't an on/ off switch.





And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear "Do you feel better?" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me "less sad.") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.





The Robin Williams posts are triggering, because they are filled with ignorant comments about "caring." If I die, millions will never know, much less billions, much less care as one /r/self post proclaims. Friends and family will move on, because their advice to me is always, "Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Just let go of that bad stuff." 



Obligatory Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! It's my first!

So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)



When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts. Those might be more likely to be a "cry for help" scenario  (which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide. If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)



Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.



Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  



Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out. 



Rick Sanchez makes me feel like somebody gets it.

I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 



I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 



My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 



In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 



A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 



About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 



I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 



This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 



My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 



I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 



I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways. 



If you took the time to read this, I thank you. I just needed to vent. 



And to add something; for those of you struggling with suicidal thoughts, as I have in the past, please PLEASE seek help. Don't do this to those that care about you. 



EDIT: Wow. I wrote this last night before getting some rest, and I woke up to a whole lot of positive feedback and support. I can't tell you how much it means to me. 



For those that sent me PMs, I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you to everyone here for being so supportive - you guys seriously have no idea how much it helps. I'll be going through everyone's response today.

Today during class, I drew what depression is like for me. It sounds weird, but it made me feel better for a while. Anyways, here it is.

It means a lot that you guys appreciate it, and I'm glad I made something finally that people like. Thanks again, I love all of you and have a great weekend. :)

I'm so tired of hearing "everyone's depressed" and "other people have it much worse than you." Like I'm completely aware my life should be great and now I just feel bad for complaining?? Are more people really diagnosed now or are we just hearing about it more? I understand I'm not a special snowflake who deserves special attention because I can't control my emotions but also give me a break.  



*edit: aw, guys. this has really blown up in just over 24 hours. I'm so glad none of us are alone and it's truly comforting to hear your stories and points of view. I have a very hard time deciphering my emotions and figuring out what i actually feel and what i think i'm feeling. it makes it very hard for me to trust myself that i actually have a problem, a chemical imbalance, rather than a bad few weeks. many of you explained how i feel better than i ever would have been able to. i kind of wrote this as a rant because i've been frustrated with my "support system" blowing me off as just in a bad mood most of the time because i'm highly functioning. i go to work, i run errands, i see friends, but then i just come home and crash in bed with my clothes still on for hours and hours until i have to force myself to get up and shower and go to sleep. "you just need to sleep more," or "try to relax," or my personal favorite, "have you tried meditating or yoga?" HA. we've all been there. 



i still feel shame in admitting my depression, anxiety, or eating issues, because i do feel like i'm looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and i'd much rather fly under everyones radar. but i am getting help. i've been on medications for several years, and have seen therapists in that time as well. if you even THINK you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life, please go see a therapist. many places accept all kinds of insurances, including medicaid, so it's completely free. please look into it! take care, friends. ❤️

I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, and I just experienced the worst episode I've had in a while-- the spiraling thoughts of self-hatred, the difficulty breathing, the paralysis, etc. 



In the past when I've gotten to that place I typically cut myself to provide a temporary distraction and catharsis. Today, I was able to not do that. And I'm so relieved. I think I'm getting through this.

I feel so proud of myself for not letting myself succumb to the depression today and actively fighting my lethargy! Even though I know that tomorrow morning I might disappoint myself, I won today's battle. Try to remember that every proactive thing you do (no matter how small, like making coffee) is a huge personal success! 



(to clear things up, I have taken to sitting in the shower since summer was over due to a lack of willpower/energy which results in longer, depressing showers instead of invigorating like a shower should be)



EDIT: so happy to see that my post has inspired others and thank you ALL for the congratulations and encouraging words :) this subreddit is truly a wonderful and supportive community

These are the links to the three previous resource post lists. There is a lot to look through, but knowledge can be your best weapon. There are recommended videos, books, articles, resources, guides, how to help yourself, how to help others, research, military specific resources, quotes from literary memoirs and medical journals, reddit comments and discussions, and much more. I posted these links at different times, so each link has additional information I had found from the previous post (there are character limits to posts). I am sorry that many of my links are just that- links- rather than descriptions of the links, but I keep editing as I can to make these lists more user friendly and easier to navigate, and I am constantly adding to the lists as I find more information worth sharing. I was going to just create a brand new post combining all like categories from the three resources posts (for example, all the videos in one section), but I thought many of the comments and discussion generated on those original posts may be just as helpful to read as the resources themselves. This has been a work in progress over two years. Pretty much everything on these lists are resources I am personally recommending because I see value to them- not just whatever comes up when you type "depression" into google.  



Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions.



Post 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/paeil/what_do_you_know_about_depression/



Post 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xoowi/my_massive_list_of_depression_resources_part_1_im/



Post 3: http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xq2ts/my_massive_list_of_depression_resources_part_2/



edit 1: some of you have messaged me about links no longer working. Please let me know if you encounter any problems with the links since I haven't checked them all lately to see if they are still active, especially the videos which are often removed for copyright reasons. I will try to track down and replace the outdated links if I can.

I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, but the past year or so it's become a serious problem for me. I started seeing a therapist and started medication, and it's helped me tremendously. However, trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult. How do you articulate something that you've had your whole life? It's not like I really knew the other side, so to speak. It was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously.



SO…I made some photographs (all self portraits) that aim to describe how I feel. I've always been a more visual person anyway. Hopefully others find some type of comfort in this. Let me know what you think!

I didn't know how to phrase the title to make it shorter, but I am realizing this right now as I'm in the middle of a crisis. I'm depressed, suicidal, but also pretty anxious (especially socially anxious) and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety. Because I don't live alone, I feel like I wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged. The attention I would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if I think about it now. Just thinking about it makes me panic, and by trying to avoid the anxiety, I try not to think about my death. 



While the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time (yay, apathy and anhedonia!), which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack. 



So I guess that's a good thing, isn't it?   





Edit: Oh wow, you guys. I was not expecting all of this at all. I wrote this kind of in the middle of a really bad mental breakdown, while trying to give myself reasons to get out of bed the next morning. I'm sorry it took me so long to come back to this post. But thank you so much for the replies. I have read all of them, and will reply. I hope all of you have a great, great day. Let's keep our heads high! :)

I spend all day on Reddit so I don't have to think about things that stress me out. The stupid thing is that there are things that I want to do, yet I always put them off until tomorrow. I've wanted to start a webcomic for quite a while now. I have a tablet and can download Photoshop for free from my university, yet I haven't drawn a single panel. If I can't even get myself to do something for fun, how the hell am I going to survive life?



I'm on winter break right now, but it ends in 6 days. Before winter break, I promised myself that I'd apply for the study abroad program that I need for graduation, but I haven't started that either. I'm so nervous about asking for recommendations, since I haven't had any professors for more than a term, due to switching majors twice. I know I need to just do it, but the more I put it off, the more anxious I get.



**EDIT:** Wow, this post got so much more attention than I was expecting. I'm really glad to know that I'm not the only one struggling with this. That being said, I think it's time for me to really make an effort to disconnect myself from Reddit. To help me in this process, I'm going to be deleting this account, so I'll have less of an attachment here. I've read every one of your posts here. Thank you for sharing your experiences and opinions, and I wish you all the best in overcoming your struggles.

So there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. I'd always apologize even if I was wrong. I refused to apologize and it all fucked up. She knew I had depression when we were in relationship. I told her I feel depressed and she said "There's no such thing as depression"



Anyway, she found out from out our common friend that I visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. So at the end of the chat,I told her I'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said "I don't give a fuck even if you die"



I stopped texting her after that. I was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, I fucking won't. Fuck you.. I'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.



EDIT: Just came home and saw your replies. I'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. In the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if I can help one person, I'd be the happiest person in this world.

In July 2013, a redditor told me on a comment thread that he was planning on killing himself by age 21, and I just wanted to say:



Have a happy birthday, and remember that we here at r/depression care! I know this year has sucked, and I'm here to let you know that it WILL work out, and if I care enough to remember your birthday when you told me in July, others do too. Stay with us, death sucks, don't die, and PLEASE don't end yourself because you DO matter! We love you!

It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 



You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 



If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. 



No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 



Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. 



Have a heart.

Now first off I feel it's imperative to say that I haven't officially been diagnosed with anything; in fact I haven't even talked to anyone about how awful I've been feeling the past year or so.  However I feel I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, I do not feel suicidal at all).



I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but I was thinking that if I did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication I would not feel comfortable with taking it.  I mean for one, I have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  Even just talking to someone I feel like I wouldn't properly be able to open up about what I've been going through. 



...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, there are times where I am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  I feel like I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I mean I have a great job, I'm only 23, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   



It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.  I just feel as though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible.

Is that depressed people are honestly some of the nicest, open-minded, loving people I have ever met/talked to. We all know how it feels to be in the darkest places, and we don't want to see anybody go through that. I feel like a lot of us would stand by somebody and help them through anything they needed. Whether it be big or small, depressed people know that there is no such thing as a big or small problem. Problems are problems. People just like to point and act like they know what we are going through. Like we are the mud on the bottom of the shoe, and can't "Lighten up". 



I really don't know any of you, but I already know that you are all some of the best people out there. I know how strong you all are, how loving you all are, how open-minded you all are. In some weird, seemingly contradictory way, you all are the love that is needed in the world. 



 Nobody wants to talk to a depressed person, but a depressed person would talk to anybody.

I know, Im really late on having my first kiss. Today I finally kissed my crush, and it felt wonderful. For a moment, all of my problems were lifted off my shoulders and I felt like someone actually cared about me. I just thought I would share this with you guys, because for me right now in my life, its about all I have.



Edit: Wow everyone, thanks for all the kind responses, I never thought this post would really get any feedback, and it now has 556 up votes on the front page. I really appreciate everyones support, and I hope each and every one of you has a wonderful day. Stay strong! - Colourgreen3

Hello everyone. As the title says, a year ago on June 20th I hit my lowest point. I had close calls before, but this one was worse. I was going to throw myself in front of a train. After that incident I decided to get my act together. I started seeing a therapist and being more open with my friends about myself. In addition, I started to draw again. 



Some of the stuff in this album I have submitted to here or r/Anxiety, and it's been pretty well received. This is the first time I'm submitting almost everything I've done up til now, so I hope you guys like it and this helps you cope. Please tell me if this is harmful and I will take it down immediately.

You might think this is a joke. It isn't. I've wanted to kill myself for a long while now, probably since around 12 years old. The only thing that alleviated my depression when I was younger was Fallout 3. It was the best game I'd ever played. I swore to myself when I got bored of FO3 (two years after it came out) that I wouldn't kill myself until Fallout 4 was released. I didn't count New Vegas, because, well, it sucked. Now that 4 is coming out, I don't know what to do with myself. I still want to die, but I can't just keep pushing it off until the next Fallout release. I'm addicted to the series, yes, but I'd like to have some motivation to live other than a video game. I feel so pathetic. I've attempted suicide twice before and been admitted to a ward for two weeks once, which only made things worse. What else is there to live for? People generally bore or upset me. I have a girlfriend, friends, family, pets, a job, everything I could really ask for. I'm not allowed to get medication as I'm still under my parents insurance. I'm working on going back to therapy, but my parent's think my depression is just in my head.  I'd really love some advice, or just someone to talk about random shit online with. 



I hope people don't see this as some kind of joke. Just writing this has helped, to some degree. 



Thanks.



Edit: Fallout was released last night at midnight. I'm feeling pretty good about it so far, but it better have some damn good replayability cuz fallout 5 is probably quite a ways off... I'm honestly surprised to see how much attention this got. Its really pretty cool that other people can empathize with me. Thanks all.

My attention span is shockingly short, I forget things all the time, and my thoughts are all over the place. 



The worst thing has to be the memory problems. I forget shit all the time. What chores I'm supposed to do around the house, and whether or not I took my meds this morning. 



I also have a lot of trouble focusing. I can't get anything meaninguful done because my brain is so scrambled. Even driving has proven dangerous a few times. Sometimes I doubt whether or not I should be out on the road. I can hardly read a book for enjoyment because my mind is so disorganized.



People close to me think that I'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but I'm actually trying my best. But they won't hear any of it. They always see "if you wanted to, you would" and while I guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that I forget shit all the time.



On top of all this, the lack of energy makes me not want to do the things I *do* remember, so it's like an obstacle course of things I have to get through before anything gets done. I have to actually be awake and not sleep all day. Then I have to remember what to do. Then I have to have the energy to do it. Then I have to have the focus and overall mental competence to do it properly.



I feel like I have the mind of an eighty year old at age twenty, minus the wisdom and experience.

After having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what I did today made me extremely happy. I hope I keep doing better.



Edit: thank you for all the support! I think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. I love this community.

I go to one of the largest universities in the nation and am having a really tough time here while trying to not let depression take over my life. Yesterday, I was killing time in between classes as usual, sitting near some trees in a popular part of campus to study at. On a scale from 0-10, my depression was at an 8 or 9 and I desperately needed help. I posted on Yik Yak asking if anyone near me wanted to give me a hug (Yik Yak is a popular app among college students kind of like an anonymous twitter, and you can only see posts within a mile away from you or something like that). I ended up deleting the post almost instantly because I felt silly asking for a stranger to give me a hug. But within a minute, a random girl peeked at my phone, asked if I was the one who posted the anonymous cry for help and hugged me while I choked back tears. I still can't believe it happened. I didn't catch her name or say much to her but it really helped me get through the day.

I know depression makes it hard to remember things in the short term, but I feel like depression changes my memory in a way that I never hear anyone else talk about. After a depressive episode, I feel like everything that occurred before that episode is from the distant past, like in another life, and I have a hard time remembering it or connecting to it. Even after I have fully recovered from the episode.



My last episode was during last fall, and even though I got better in the spring, I still feel like I have a hard time recalling my life before the fall. It just feels like everything is so different now, like I moved to a different town, but I didn't.



I don't really know how to explain it, but it is just a distinct feeling to me. I am really curious if this happens to other people.



Edit: Wow. I did not expect so many replies. I know this is not even remotely the worst aspect of depression (at least for me it isn't), but even after I'm clear of the depression this still haunts me. And I have had to explain to people over and over again that my memory is bad, and I can't really explain why... sometimes it's even hard to convince myself that I'm not just stupid or flakey. But hearing that this happens to so many other people too... I don't know. It sounds cheesy but it just makes me feel like I am really not alone in this. I know there are other people out there who understand. Thank you for your comments :)

It was really casual, for some reason. I changed all my passwords, reset my phone, took out my sim card, I told my mom I loved her, which I haven't done since I was 9, took my extra belt, and left into the woods. When I got where I wanted to be, I put my favorite song on. I tied the belt to a branch, and stayed in the tree for a few minutes to think for the last time before I go. But when I fell, it broke and I hit the ground. So I just walked home, and my sister was in the kitchen so I asked her if she liked Radiohead, she said no and then I went into my room and I tried not to cry but I couldn't really help it. This was just a few hours ago. I don't know if I should tell anyone

* You sleep 4 hours some nights and 16 hours others. 

* The grocery store is right across the street but you just can't get over there to buy food. 

* You need a dedicated blanket for your couch for those times when you just can't get up. 

* You run out of clothes to wear because you just can't make yourself do the laundry. 

* Dirty dishes pile up in the sink even when you do manage to run the dishwasher, because ypu can't manage to unload it. 

* You come home from work and just lay down on the couch because you have no energy to do anything. 

* If you're unemployed like me, same, but as soon as you wake up. 

* Sometimes you do make it out of bed, and onto the floor. The door is just too far away. 

* You buy books, games, etc. and they sit on your shelf because you don't have the energy to read them. 

* You regularly go days without leaving your apartment. 

* You get a solid 8-9 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted. 

* You think of things you normally like to do, and just don't care to actually do them. When you do, you just get bored and don't get any enjoyment from it. 

* You hear the phone ring and just can't be bothered to get up and answer it. 

* You try as hard as you can to think positively, but everything just feels dull and grey. 

* When you do "well" you just feel apathetic and that you only did what was expected of you. 

* Your goal in life is to minimize suffering instead of maximizing enjoyment. 

* You'd be okay if one day you fell asleep and just didn't wake up, even if you don't actually want to kill yourself. 

* Everything in life just feels like a burden. Even eating. 

* You can't remember a time in life where you truly felt happy. Moments of pleasure are scarce and fleeting. 

* You don't take vacation days because there's nowhere you want to go. 

* You hate being around happy people because it just reminds you of how bad you feel. 

* You take antidepressants and see a therapist and it doesn't really help.

I've been on medical leave from work to seek treatment. Few know where I am. Those who know have been telling those who ask some variation of "She's fine, just taking care of what she needs to." Three people know...all three have told that they've just been relaying that I'm fine.





The other day, my supervisor and I talked about sending the office an email about how I'm okay and fine (her exact words) with my expected return date





Fine. My apt. is a dumpster. I don't have real relationships. All I do is eat and throw up at 31. Never once have I uttered those words "fine", but others are saying it for me. I don't even know what I'm hoping for or want...but I feel like my illness is all made up in my head. If I had cancer, nobody would say I was fine. I get that they are protecting my privacy but at the same time it feels like it is "less" than a physical illness.  





I'm feel so suicidal lately but too numb to do anything about it. I'm unbearably lonely, sad and hopeless. I'm not fine. I don't want to go back to work with a fake smile plastered on, but I have to. Because depression isn't seen as a real sickness or as serious until suicide. 





Back when I asked for leave, my supervisor even told me to let people know it wasnt something "serious" so that people wouldn't worry.

She texted me to say good bye while I was gone for a couple hours today. I was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. She was gone by the time I got back home. She had been fighting depression and I guess she lost. I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, I can't. The image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. That was my baby, my better half. Falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. There's a huge hole in me and I don't know what to do or how to handle it. I just cry, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. To anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? What gave you the will to want to go another day? Or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what I'm feeling.



Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and I'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. Can't take any more tonight.



I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, I haven't cared about any of it. I've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 



Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf



It's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, on Oct 15. Fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. The coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. I got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. I wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. The reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. Well her mom was gone but not for what I was told. There was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. There was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. Id here her talking to herself, but now I'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. She would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. This just makes things clearer and so much more sad.



12/03/2012: I am doing much better everyone. I thank you all for you thoughts and concerns. Life has gotten easier as time is passing on for the most part. The only lingering effects is the last image of her, every time something remind me of her my mind goes straight to that. That happens quite a bit, but hopefully that will pass as the other pain has. To those that have messaged me saying how much this has helped them, it really means a lot to me. I am glad some good could have come from this at least. If anyone needs to talk, please feel free to message me.

About a week ago my wife left the apartment, bought a gun, drove somewhere secluded, pulled over and shot herself. I have been with her since 2007 when we were still in high school. We became adults together.



I have always had mildish depression and anxiety, but she has always had major depression and suicidal ideation. It just kept getting worse and worse. She tried all sorts of medications, therapy (including DBT). She had a partial diagnosis for BPD as well.



I'm not even exactly sure why I am posting here other than to vent a bit. I see a regular therapist and have an appointment monday. I am also on an SSRI already, so I am taking the proper steps. I just am so beside myself. I always knew it would happen. She told me it would and that there was no way to change it. I lived in constant fear and anxiety that she would have a breakdown or even kill herself. I had to make so many excuses for her to my family throughout the years. I could always tell they disproved (even if only a little bit) of me putting so much effort into her. I think they better understand now.



I do not mean to be dramatic, but I feel like, even though I do not regret being with her, it has tormented me in a deep, possibility irreversible way. I know she never meant to harm me and it was the depressed train of thinking she had, but only about a week before she killed herself, I finally got her to admit what I suspected for a long time. She was distancing herself from me for 8 months in order to soften the blow of her suicide. For 8 months at least, she was purposefully distant, did not even try to console me when the situation became too hard for me. I felt so alone. I hate myself for being just a bit relieved that she is dead, because the pain of seeing her suffer was so unimaginably hard to bear.



I feel so angry at her parents, especially her mom, for always putting her down. Making her feel worthless. Her mother is the literal worst person I know. She always acted as if she supported her daughter in everything she did when out in public, but in private she shit on everything she did. My wife was literally a genius at least according to the IQ tests the doctors gave her when diagnosing her mental illnesses. She was an incredible artist who painted, drew, sewed, wood burned, and a shit ton of other things. Anything art, she could do. And her parents hated that, because she did not want to join the Navy like them or go into business. She wanted to teach and almost achieved her dreams before the depression worsened to the point that she quit school and work.



I just wish could have been different for her. All she ever wanted to do was help people and make the world better. I just want to sit on my ass and play video games. Why here and not me. I work in corrections and see a bunch of scum everyday who love the fuck out of themselves. Why not them. She never hurt a god damn soul.



Edit: A name.



Edit 2: I just want everyone to know that I was hesitant about even posting anything about my situation, but I am glad that I did because it has been very therapeutic. I only have two people in my life that really understand depression and how it affect one's thoughts, feeling and beliefs. Most of the people in my life just do not have the ability to comprehend what happened and I am both glad and deeply saddened that the people here do. So thank you everyone.



Edit 3: Thank you kind stranger for the gold. I think I know who is was, but I will just leave it at that.



Edit 4: Just a few photos of my wife's art.

Hey, friends! Today I want to talk about suicidal depression. Every time there's a big suicide in the news, I see a lot of conversation that makes me concerned. It seems like depression is a problem that lots of people don't understand very well. I'm sorry this is so long, but it's an issue that's very close to me. 



I see people say things like "It was the coward's way out" or "he threw it all away over nothing." You should understand that depression is extremely real to people who are struggling with it. It's an illness. Your brain isn't working properly, the same way a broken limb doesn't work properly. Instead of being unable to walk, you're unable to process positive feelings. You're constantly in a state of sadness, or anger, or fear, or self-loathing. This is a lifelong condition for many people. You can develop coping strategies, but there's no real "cure" or universal answer. If that imagery is not helpful, it's like having goblins in your brain. It's like fighting an enemy every single day that you can't see who makes it impossible for you to be happy. It doesn't matter that you have all these nice things and people who love you, because you physically can't enjoy them or anything else. That's a really hard way to live. It hurts me when I hear people with depression described as "weak." They have to be strong and brave everyday, just to leave their house or have social interactions. These are people fighting a war that makes it difficult or painful to do very basic things. It is tragic when someone dies fighting that battle, but it is not shameful. 



The second thing I want to talk about is dismissive solutions. I LOVE that treatment for mental illness is becoming more socially acceptable. However, it seems like some people think the conversation ends at "Get help." "If only he had gotten help!" "Why didn't he get help?" "Why didn't he dial H-E-L-P on the phone so the Helpers in the Help Van could take him to the Helpatorium?" It is absolutely important to tell people "get help." It is sometimes a little patronizing when it's coming from people who don't understand how hard that is. I've seen this taken to a very nasty place, where people say things like "it's his fault for not getting help. Why should I have sympathy?" If you're struggling with depression, I want to stress that seeking help absolutely should be the most important thing in your life after basic survival necessities. If you've never struggled with depression, I want to stress that seeking help can be MUCH harder than you think it is. 



I have struggled with suicidal depression for most of my adult life. I called the suicide hotline back when I was delivering pizzas. It is not a magical fix-everything service. They told me their nearest facility was further away than I could afford to drive on my gas budget. I've tried talking about depression to most of my friends. I'm fortunate to have some great people in my life, but I've lost a lot of relationships because I was open about depression. There are people who don't understand, and they get angry at you when their misguided attempts to help don't work. There are people who just slowly back out of your life because talking to you makes them sad or uncomfortable. I don't blame these people. It is very difficult to deal with someone else's depression. That's nobody's fault, but it makes depression very isolating. I've tried to get professional help many times. I've had doctors who were helpful, but we couldn't afford them. I've had doctors who were unhelpful and made things worse. I've been put on medications that made me better for a little while. I've been put on medications that messed me up so badly I couldn't leave my house and had to switch high schools. This is not even getting into how hard it can be emotionally to seek treatment. You have to be able to admit your deepest problems to yourself, and talk about them articulately with total strangers. I don't know a lot of people who can do that, even without depression. It is very difficult to seek any sort of treatment at all when you honestly don't like yourself and don't believe you deserve to get better. I'm not telling this as a sob story to try and garner sympathy. I just want people to understand that everybody struggling with depression has stories like this. We almost never talk about them because we are trying to pretend to be normal.



I hate when posts like this are all criticism, so I'll try to leave with something helpful. You have so much more power than you think you do to help another person. Even when you don't feel like you're making a difference, the smallest acts of kindness can really touch people in unexpected ways. You probably don't understand depression. That is okay! We appreciate it when you are honest about not understanding. We're sick of people telling us they understand when they don't. You don't have to understand. You just have to believe us.

I'm posting this here because I don't really know where else to put it. I noticed the sidebar link to SuicideWatch, but it didn't feel right to start a thread there among all the other people who really need help. 



Since I was a teenager I've had "casual" suicidal thoughts. I don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when I say that, I literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go "I made a small mistake at work today, I should just drive into that concrete barrier" Or I'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching TV or something, and think "you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head." I don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. And what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like "yeah, I guess that /is/ an option!"



This has been normal for me for so long, every day for years, but recently I've been thinking about how fucked up it is. And I feel alone because it's like you can't tell anybody about it or else they'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode. 



I just had to get this off my chest. It's difficult to have these cavalier thoughts and feel like a freak on top of keeping a lid on the depression/anxiety/"imposter syndrome" to seem normal every day.

Now I'm not sure where to go.



I feel so alone.

I could never kill myself. I don't know if it's because I'm too afraid or because I care too much about my loved ones. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to go to sleep forever. I don't want it to be anyone's fault when I stop living. I just want to pass away, I just don't want to have to do anything anymore, I don't want to live in this circle of feeling pain and feeling empty anymore. Why is my heart so motivated to keep beating? Why can't it be like me, or I like it?



EDIT: Thank you for all your responses, experiences and thoughts. I didn't expect so many people to feel the same way, and it's a good feeling knowing that I'm not alone with these thoughts.

the only thing i ever have to look forward to is playing the next game or seeing the next movie or waiting until the next episode of whatever the fuck



my need for fiction stems from the hope that i can find something to lose myself in for a few hours. maybe a few days.

After battling depression over the last year, I have come to discover some tips that have improved the overall quality of my life. The first, and most important discovery, was a change in the way I perceived happiness. Before my bout with depression, I assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. Happiness was my baseline, I didn’t have to do anything, and I just was content. Of course, this all changed once the darkness came creeping in, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. Here’s what I discovered; being happy takes effort. Being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. Thinking that you can magically become happy, or not depressed, without changing any aspect of your life is absurd. Once I got my mind around this concept, I worked on my emotional wellbeing every day. It’s a lot like weight lifting. It takes a lot of effort, it isn’t easy, and it takes a while before you see results. However, it is completely worth it in the end. 

Not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me, but I will share my experience in the hopes that it helps you out. Here are the simple things I added to my life that helped lift the apathy, sadness and empty dullness I was stuck in: 



1)	**Talking about it.** I got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. We literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. After a few weeks it really started to help. I was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring SO that put up with me while I battled through the darker times. 



2)	**Putting away the booze.** I don’t think I had a problem with booze, but it wasn’t improving the quality of my life, so I stopped drinking. Made a difference. 



3)	**Exercising. Seriously.** It might sounds cliché, but holy shit does this ever help out. Lifting weights and doing hard cardio was amazing for my mental health. While you are busting your ass in the gym or at home, you leave your problems for a brief amount of time and focus on completing tasks at hand. Lift that fucking weight 7 more times, that’s all I have to do, just lift it. The physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain I was feeling inside and I was finally able to match my mind and body. Being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. It also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, I was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. Walk around the block, go for a run, do a few pushups in your room, just do it, get out of breath, push yourself for no reason, feel your body, get in the moment.



4)	**Gardening.** I never planted shit before. On a whim I bought some peat pellets, some hot pepper seeds and a few plastic containers – about a $15 investment. Best money I’ve ever spent. The process of germinating seeds, watering plants, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. I read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. I live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but I have a window with sunlight and that’s all you need. Having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. Grow something. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Try it out. 



5)	**Meditation.** I still suck at it, but it works. Every morning before work I take 5 minutes for myself. I just sit on the floor in my living room, look out the window and breathe. 20 deep breaths, focusing on the act of breathing. In, out, in, out. Simple. I added stretching into the mix. Stretch, breathe. 5 minutes, not a lot of time, not a lot of effort, but the mental clarity achieved is great. Stop reading this right now, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and breathe it out. Do it again 2 more times. Try it, right now.



6)	**Vitamins and water.** Omega 3 (fish oil), Vitamin B, Multivitamin, Vitamin D. Take them. Especially the Omega 3 and Vitamin B. After only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins I noticed a difference in my mood. Drink lots of water. More than you are currently drinking now. It’s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. Plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. 



7)	**Daily log and journal.** The world isn’t out to get you, people aren’t out to get you, your problems are not impossible to deal with, but they do need to be addressed. This was hard for me to learn. Pick 1 daily goal. That’s it. What do you want to accomplish today? What completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? Need to make a phone call? Need to pay a bill? Need to wash your sheets? Once task, one goal, per day. Write it down, that’s important. Write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. You might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. The feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, even the small one, just recognize what needs to be done, make a goal, and try. Do it right now, open up notepad or get a pen and paper, and write down the date and what you’d like to get done today. Big or small. Just try. 



8)	**Small improvements.** Do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance. Get a haircut, trim/shave, paint your nails, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. Do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. Use some mouthwash; make your breath smell a little better. Doesn’t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, a tiny improvement. Lots of tiny improvements over time make a big difference. Take care of your body, and it will influence your mental state. Look better, feel better, be better. Small, tiny incremental improvements. You will get a boost from completing the task, and overtime this adds up. 



9)	**Understand that it is a journey.** It’s hard. For you, and for me, happiness is not baseline. Our normal, everyday feelings are not happy. That’s ok. You can work towards a better life. Some of the shit that I mentioned above takes 5 minutes. The activities aren’t hard, most are enjoyable, what’s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. Just fucking try it, please. Pick a couple and try it out. You’re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. Yeah you didn’t choose to be depressed, I know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. You can help turn the tides. I went from daily suicidal thoughts, to being able to crack a smile here and there. You owe it to yourself to try. I think you can do it. You’re awesome.  



EDIT: Speaka_Engrish brought up a great point - Just to tag on to number 8, keep your room clean! Make your bed, wash the dishes, don't let little problems pile up; take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. A clean room is analogous to a clean mind.



EDIT 2: AndNowIKnowWhy made another great suggestion - Find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. "Making" something can become very meditative and self-asserting. Whether it's drawing or doing something with fabrics, wood, clay, metal, styropor, papermaché, threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. 



Just don't do it to create something perfect, but rather to just create for the fun of it. It can be very stimulating and I like to create useful stuff for my household. Just googling the words "easy diy" and hit the image search will provide you with tons of ideas of which might be for you. also r/crafts, r/diy and all the other subs linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you.

Hey Reddit. About a year ago I was diagnosed with both bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder both. It's really rough because sometimes I'll get depressed for a week at a time, only to get out of that funk and immediately get depressed for a month straight. In August I came to college and it's been really rough so far. Whenever I've been in a good mood, things have been really nice. I like to keep a workout routine going, and I'll be sociable with the people around me, even though I haven't really made friends yet.



However, when I'm not in a good mood it becomes awful. I get so lonely and sad that I just stay in my dorm room all day playing video games and hating myself. The only person I have that I can consistently talk to who cares about me is my girlfriend, but we're five hours apart thanks to college.



Anyways, for the past couple of weeks I've been so depressed that I've even been skipping classes, which is something that I never do. I haven't eaten because I didn't want to leave my dorm, I haven't worked out, I've just been sitting in my room playing video games and trying to get out of bed at least once in a day.



But today was different. Today, I woke up at around 9:30 and immediately got up and showered. I went and got coffee and an english muffin from a cafe, and sat down and wrote out a schedule for the day. I worked out, I wrote up a study guide for my psychology exam, and as I'm typing this I'm about to go get my laundry out of the dryer. Today has been a good day.



Sorry for the rant, it just feels nice to finally do something. I feel like I'm actually taking care of myself for once.

After throwing the flaming pan out of the window straight onto the street I've been thinking and developing strategies how to get rid of the smoke and that horrible smell. It's awesome. I'm making herbal mixtures and boiling scent candles in water now. I feel like a shaman.



10/10 would burn shit again.

I just saw this saying on tumblr and it made me think of the amount of times I see people get told they can't feel sad because others are starving and such. Also as someone who gets told this by their family it almost made me cry



Oh and sorry if someone else already has

It is a horrible feeling, a constant battle in your own head, it's impossible to describe. You just feel sad and down all the time, it's not like I am choosing this, I am not making excuses for being lazy or absent, it is a genuine struggle to even move sometimes. You are constantly beating yourself up over every tiny little detail, physical details, small offhand comments, voices in crowds, even minute non conversational exchanges.



You tell yourself a lot of horrible things, rationalise reasons others don't like you, don't want to talk to you. Once you attempt to help yourself, then it becomes a battle to identify these illogical thoughts, however deep down the illness makes these cruel and intrusive thoughts your reality. 



Different emotions get overplayed in your head, you become numb, you feel nothing, not happy or sad or angry or confused, just empty. You become vulnerable to becoming addicted to anything that offers even just a temporary takes the pain away. 



Depression eats at you forming vicious circles. It tells you that you are worthless, your life has no value, and that every single person that is around you is there only out of obligation, fleeting sympathy, or even to make fun of you. Your whole reality just becomes one giant charade of mocking characters. The more you run and hide and be "polite" because people clearly don't want to talk to you anyway, the further you isolate yourself and the harsh reality is that after enough time, people just forget about you, they take your silence as a personal attack, people are inherently inward and think because you are quiet or take the quiet route it is something they've done, when it's often your own fear that makes you do that. It leads to paranoia, insomnia, voices, short temper and anxiety, which are symptoms of the bigger problem.



I actually hate the fact it's called depression, because normal people can feel depressed, maybe you fail a test or your partner dumps you, the title depression implies that is a state of mind that comes and goes, and while it varies in severity day to day, I feel like unless you have actually experienced it, you don't know what it's like to have to put up such an enormous and complex facade to mask the never ending crippling sadness.



People say "you look tired" "why the serious/sad look?" "why so monotone?" Because I am tired and I am sad. All the time. 24/7/365. Even when you reach peak euphoria, say laughing with a group, the voice immediately jumps back and comes up with a reason the gratification is false.



It's not a nice thing, to feel this way, it makes you fear and resent the outside world, preventing you from reaching anywhere near your potential, it makes you wish you were dead, it makes you want to kill yourself, it makes you want to kill everyone else so they would understand your pain, but I learned a long time ago that violence never ever makes any situation better.



If I have to take time off work because I break my leg or I develop cancer it's fine, because people understand that there a physical reasons that I cannot operate at full capacity or sometimes cease to function at all. Because of depression, you harm yourself, you want to kill yourself, you lay in bed for days in a catatonic state, you wrestle long sleepless nights, staying awake for days, you throw up, you can't eat and starve, you overeat and have to curl up, you spend all your money on drugs, you get angry and force out anyone who's still around. So if anyone is genuinely thinks I am trying to validate a mopey or lazy lifestyle, take a glance at the above list and imagine what it's like dealing with these problems day to day.



You never voice your opinions because depression tells you that they are not worth expressing, that you are worthless, that other people will call you out for taking about yourself for even just a second, this will probably never be posted anywhere because I don't want to burden anyone with the task of reading it, I don't want it to be misconstrued as self obsessed tripe, I don't want to shade other peoples more serious problems, 1001 other bullshit reasons why I shouldn't post this 



I as a Redditor try to explain a lot of my behaviour using the introvert extrovert situation. I eat and sleep, drink and walk along alone all day, I sit and listen to music and have fun with my hobbies, read some interesting books and watch some great films, and it works. But god damn I am alone :(



Thanks for probably not reading.





Edit:

God damn guys, I cried so hard just now coming back to see so many of you have been genuinely touched by my late night ramblings, I feel a lot less alone now and it reinforced the fact depression is a mere illness that can be improved upon. Thanks for the comments, upvotes and gold, and having your countless and genuine heartfelt replies gave me a boost to call some of my old friend and grandmother today and see how they were. I feel a lot better today thanks to so many of you and going by the comments so do some of you, you are all more than welcome for any warmness this gave you. 



I love you guys and thanks for proving me wrong and actually reading.

In this one year I moved 3 times, including in with my parents, was "funemployed", had 39 out of 40 job applications rejected, moved across the country, went to meetups religiously and befriended everyone I could, tried (and miserably failed at) online dating, medicated, therapized, exercised, got into a car accident, meditated, dated myself, and sometimes cried so hard that I had bruises under my eyes. 





I'm not even close to where I want to be, but fuck it, I'm going to give it another year.





My brain is broken; I recognize that. It will take a long time until the chemical imbalances are fixed and the destructive neural pathways wither away into ghostly remnants, but in the meantime I'm going to try my hardest to be the best person I can while continuing everything else I've been doing...except for the crying... =) 



edit: You all are amazing! Thanks for the support and the gold (and also my most upvoted post)!! I wanted to point out that setting a goal that might not be met isn't something I would advocate for most people, but in the moment it was a way to keep myself going.

The experience of being unable to leave the bed due to physical illness is no different than being unable to leave due to depression, except to everyone around you. Why should I have to pretend to be happy around his alcoholic father when my own wonderful father is 1,000 miles away? I just can't do it today. But I don't have a choice.

I have absolutely no purpose in life at the moment, I start university in October but Im very anxious about it and I've yet to find a room / an apartment to live in because we are very poor, so that kinda doesnt help.





My days are just sleeping long, eating, browsing reddit and watching videos / tv shows.





Cant even get enjoyment out of video games anymore. 





The girl I really liked and started seeing texted me she's not interested in a relationship right now, that also brought me down and fueled my depression again. 





Sorry for this messy post I just had to get shit out probably.

So I used to be those people who, if you were depressed, would tell you that it's "all in your head" or -insert cliche suggestion/advice-. I wasn't mean about it. I just didn't believe in it.



Well, fast forward a few years, at 20 years old I got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. 7 months later, it spread all over my body, affecting my hands and feet the most. On top of that, I am also active duty. I played piano, I kick boxed, I hiked, I was active. And all of that was stripped away in the matter of months.



Because of that, and everything just kind of spiraled out of my control (I'm a bit of a control freak) I suddenly realized one day, there are very little things that make me happy. I feel empty. I tried everything to get back to my old cheery self. Then, I didn't want to try at all. The world got a a shade of gray, my steps were meaningless, food had no taste, everything I did was just to past time, no purpose. 



2 years later I was diagnosed as depressed. 

So to everyone out there with depression, no matter how severe or how it began, I am sorry. It sucks. Literally. It's like a dementor following you around 24/7. But please stay strong. I know you might not want to. I don't want to. But I hope there's light at the end of every tunnel. 



Edit: To all those saying "It IS in your head -insert science/chemical super smart explanation here- You know what I mean. I'm not speaking in literal terms involving your brain chemicals.

You can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. But please, please don't ignore me. I want my existence to be acknowledged. I want to be sure that I'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing I'm there, like I'm an outsider looking in. Please don't make me feel any more isolated than I already do, like I have no friends who genuinely care about me. I know I suck, and I know I fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. I deserve it. But whatever you do, I'm begging you, *please* don't act like I'm not there at all.

There's no "help" when the person is only talking to you because you're giving her fucking 90 bucks an hour. She only sees you as a source of money, how can that be "help" if that's the nature of the relationship with a therapist? That's why I can't bring myself to get a therapist, because what the fuck kind of bullshit arrangement is that?

It's the only reason I haven't killed myself.



Suicide is *hard*.



There's a reason everyone, including me, wants to die but doesn't actually want to kill themselves. If suicide were as easy as pushing a button, I wouldn't be making this post right now.



But you have to get the materials, you have to make a plan. Even more difficult, you actually have to *do* it. And of course, you don't want to fuck it up, because things get even worse if you do.



Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. I just want to be dead.

I just can't do it. People always say stuff like "that's life, welcome to adulthood" etc, I don't think they understand that I'm not just saying I hate my job, I literally refuse to live this way. The way I'm going, I know eventually I'm gonna reach my breaking point and blow my brains out.



It's not acceptable to be to just sell away my entire life to some company, working toward someone else's dream at the expense of my own. I would start a business except...what the hell is my business gonna do? Plus, the vast majority of those all fail anyway.



Society has basically been set up so you have two choices: Slavery or death. Every day I feel closer to picking the latter.

I joined this sub to gain a better understanding of depression and how to support people with it. I joined for my girlfriend. I mostly lurked. I read, gathered information and tips on how to help, and to know what is good to say and what to definitely avoid saying.



It's been 5 months without any symptoms for her. If it comes back, I'll be back, but I'm hoping I don't have to. This sub has given me great insight into something I can't truly understand.



Thank you. I hope you have the same success my girlfriend (now finacée) and I have had.

I am mentally ill and I am not a bad person because of it. I am not useless. I am worth more then a bed in a hospital and a prescription. I am capable. I am worth getting a job. Getting a degree. Falling in love and starting a family - no matter what society and the media may try and tell me.



Please share your story - 



A moment where you saw someone being harassed for being mentally ill and how you stepped it



A moment you were discriminated or a friend/family member/loved one was discriminated



Actions you and/or your community are making to break the stigma.



Questions you may have about mental illness that you were always just too embarassed to ask



After being on reddit for a long while... I really think you guys and girls will help make a difference - if anyone could it's us reddit!!!!!! I posted on r/depression because there are the most redditors profoundly suffering here - ive been getting help and giving advice on this subreddit for quite some time. I knew you guys would be the place to post this. 



EDIT: over 600 upvotes! cant believe it!  (i'm ignoring down votes. cause seriously. we're thinking positive here) these stories are inspiring and the non-judgmental atmosphere is so appreciated. a lot of people have been courageous in sharing their stories and helping others - thank you so much! keep them coming they're inspiring :) 



 **Everybody's "brand" of mental illness is welcome here. Nobody is excluded!**



(*i've been getting some comments for using a throwaway account - i used a throwaway account so that this thread would be about you - not about me or my karma. if anyone would like to know more about my story/identity please feel free to ask/PM this account. i will be following this thread till it flickers out*)

I haven't seen one of these since I was little when I used to hatch them, I thought butterflies had died out...  it flew inside and couldn't get out, so I reached for it and it landed on my hand.



I've looked at the picture many times since, and it's given me a lot of strength.

I might be getting a job soon that goes from 8-4:30, Mon-Fri. All I can think about is how I will be spending a huge chunk of my day doing work for someone else. I'll have a few hours in the evening, but then it's early to bed so I can be up again by 6:30.



How do people do this and be okay with it? I honestly can't find the point to even living when 8.5 hours of every day is spent doing something I hate. You get the weekends, but they pass by so quickly and even then you usually have shit to do so you don't get to relax. 



Not sure why pretty much everyone doesn't feel the same way.

Have to get out of bed? Nah, don't feeling like it.



Get up and take a shower? Fuck that shit.



Clean my room? I'll do it tomorrow.



Apply for a job? No one will hire me anyways.



Go on a walk to get some sunlight and fresh air? Too tired.



It works the other way too, naturally. All the shit you want to do is stuff you shouldn't do.



Sit around all day and play video games? Shouldn't do that.



Stuff my face full of burgers and sodas because food is one of the only things that makes me feel good? Bad idea.



Stay at home and sulk instead of going out to do something with actual human beings? Not wise.



I feel like it's just a part of human nature to enjoy things we're not supposed to do but I feel like this is exacerbated in cases of depression. Every single freakin' fuckin' thing you feel like doing is a bad idea and every single thing you really with all your heart don't want to do can help. It's like my mind doesn't even want to get better. It's amazing how we deceive and sabotage ourselves.

Alternatively, I wish someone else could jump in and take the driver's seat of my body, and I could just passively watch from behind my eyes.  Hell, passively going through the motions of living is what I already do, but it's just so exhausting.  I don't have the energy or drive or wherewithal to make living into anything more than a chore, but apparently other people do.

Like if you can get the card game from Witcher 3 as a standalone app (you can't, it took me 3 hours of searching to work that out). Yet tomorrow, i'll want to try and motivate myself to do just an hour's seo work, or a short jog and some hand weights, and my motivation just deflates at the thought of all that effort.



It's one of the stupidest traps, that you can't do shit if it is at all important, and yet if it isn't important, you don't want to 'waste' your time on it. And you end up doing fuck all anyway. 



E: To clarify: It's not simply procrastination. It's a weird glitch in my motivation where my brain anticipates an activity that will probably only take 10 minutes to an hour, but write it off due to feeling I won't have enough energy/time to do it successfully, so it'd be a waste of time. But instead of doing something productive instead, i'll then *actually* waste the time that it would have taken me to do the thing (by just checking my phone or whatever). 



And yet I do not encounter the same motivational 'lock' when picking up my phone to type a reddit post, or experiment with settlement layouts in fallout 4. Inconsequential activities that are *actually* wasting my time seem to slip past the 'waste of time' demotivator, at least until i've spent way too long on them and then feel bad. 



I don't know if i'm explaining this right, it's just a weird logic glitch i've been thinking about. You know, instead of working :(

[Here is my painting.](http://erynkr.deviantart.com/art/Wulf-and-I-376838852)



I have schizophrenia, and my most persistent hallucination is of a large wolf. Gaming has always been a great escape for me. I couldn't sleep the other night, so I decided to paint this expression of that.



A friend of mine suffers from depression, and while our problems aren't the same, we do share the struggle.

I always search up certain symptoms to understand where certain feelings/thoughts are coming from, but they never pop up. Here's a thread for the seriously disgusting, unknown ones that you feel embarrassed talking to your therapist about. I'll start.



1. I want to have a chronic illness (like cancer) so that I don't have to commit suicide, although I will if I am absolutely done.



2. Sometimes I randomly cry, for no reason at night.



3. I often feel homicidal and it sickens me.



4. I feel comfortable in my depression, I feel comfortable being sad, I feel comfortable NOT going outside. It's like a really sick morbid embrace. It makes me cry how much I don't want to get better; I just feel like I'm meant to die, like it would do the world a favour if I don't get better and I just die.



5. Sometimes I feel like depression is the only thing that's been there for me, since all my friends and family have given up on me. And that the least I can do for it, after helping me by standing by me so much all this while, is to finally kill myself.



Share yours, as horrible as they may be. Not talking about it makes you feel more alone.

Sure I may have felt a little guilty or bad about putting so many hours into MMO's and other games from ages 10-19, but the wonders it did for passing time and making me feel good in life was the sole thing that got me through some very dark times. 



Now I WISH I could escape all day into a different world, I didn't know how good things were until it was gone.

Also, to aid the loneliness. Puppies need constant attention and training, which is time well spent for me. I have no friends really, and having my pup here has allowed me to use my superfluous time training an obedient dog. He needs me, I need him. He forces me to get out of the house (read: bed) when taking him for walks. I wake up earlier now every morning so he has a consistent feeding schedule. I can't seem to get up early or even out of bed for myself, but I can do it for him. I don't know, but I think he was a good decision for me.

I want you guys to know that I made myself breakfast...or dinner, or whatever. The point is I got up and made myself food. Two eggs, two pieces of sausage, and a piece of bread. I tore up the bread into pieces so that I could (once the eggs were done), break the yolk over the bread you know? And then cut up the sausage with my fork and mix it all together.



It was fucking delicious.



Now I have a tall glass of orange juice that is tasty as fuck too. 



I'm proud of myself. Considering how depressed and up and down I've been...I went in the fucking kitchen, washed a pan, washed a cup, a bowl, a fork, and a spatula. I feel like a fucking champion for doing that. 



Fuck yeah.



Anyway, carry on.

I barely know her, I talked to her once because she lives nearby and my roommate knows her from college. Basically, we're almost strangers. Tonight we were both on the sidewalk going in the opposite direction, then she stopped right after passing me.





Her: Are you ok?



[I turn to her, not sure if she was talking to me]



Her: Are you feeling good?



Me: Euh... I don't know



Her: You seem like really sad to me.



Me: Oh... It happens, I'm gonna be ok



Her: Are you sure? 



Me: Yeah. That's kind of you but don't worry



Her: Ok then but...



Me: Nah I'll be fine. Thanks. Good night [weak smile]





I don't know what's the saddest part, that my depression is becoming so apparent that an almost stranger passing by notices it or that I faked being ok because there was no way she could ever help me. Still, that was pretty sweet from her.

It invalidates the suffering that person is going through, makes them feel selfish for not being a starving child of the subcontinent, and, frankly, it's lazy.



My favourite personal experience with this one was when the cancer I got wasn't as bad as my brother's cancer (really) so my family could-be-worse'd me and I was essentially disallowed from being upset. 



My mum has apologsed after, how random, some grief training she had as a volunteer at the hospital.



All suffering is valid. Goddammit.



ETA - You guys are all so lovely. I might have a cry. The good cry.

Hi, I'm a long-time lurker here.  I just wanted to say that today is my last day here.  I do not belong in this subreddit any longer.  



What I'm saying is, I do not feel depressed any more.  I've felt this way for several months, but I couldn't be too sure.  However, today was my last day with my therapist, and it was perfect timing.  



I have not been on medication, I've only been in therapy since April 2013.  This was the first time I ever left my therapist outside of moving away (I grew up moving an average of once per 2-3 years) and I think it was the right decision.  



I do not feel brought down by problems in my life, or let my anxiety get the better of me.  I see doors instead of walls.  I see friends instead of enemies.  I see love instead of hatred or fear.  



The world has become beautiful again.  And I truly believe it will stay that way for a long time.



Thank you for listening :)  



Edit:  I came back here and wow, hi again.  I feel so warmed by all of the responses you guys have given.  One commenter asked how I got to this place.  My answer is consistent therapy, and finding a strong support group, mostly friends and my family.  I've been in and out of therapy since I was 12 years old after my first suicide attempt.  Honestly, I had to really make a conscious effort in my life to improve it.  Maybe I'm lucky, maybe this won't last for long, but basically what I did was find out what things exactly in my life were bringing me down.  What did I hate being a part of?  For me, that was religion.  Some people live happy, fulfilling lives by serving God or other deities, but I am not one of them.  In doing so, I found autonomy in my life choices.  I no longer feel guilty over certain aspects, such as my thoughts on sexuality, or perfection.  



But again, these are my own realizations.  Many of you have stated a hope to be in my position, and from they way I've been feeling and living my life, I hope for you to do so as well.  Once again, thank you very much for the well wishes and congratulations all around.  ((hugs))

Almost every time /r/depression gets mentioned in other subs (such as [this askreddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2wri29/which_subreddit_would_you_like_to_shake_some/cotkc4w?context=3)), people say how this place is "toxic" and that people here would rather talk about how depressed they are rather than ways to get better.



Think about that. They're literally condemning us for not being optimistic enough.



They claim they take depression seriously and how 'difficult it can be to face', but if you are so depressed that you're consumed by apathy and hopelessness, then they stop pretending to care and tell you to stop feeling sorry for yourself and to "go do something about it". It's like they think venting and looking for emotional validation and support is the worst thing a depressed person can do. *Obviously* being told a hundred times to exercise, go to a therapist, and meditate is the most helpful. *I was doubtful the first 99 times, but that last one sure changed my life!*



The worst part is that a lot of the time it's people who used to have depression saying these things. You know, those with the "if I can do it, so can you!" mentality-- similar to ex-smokers and ex-fat people in that regard.



It just seems like the more depressed you are, the less people want to help. And if they *do* try to help, they get angry if their advice and platitudes aren't met with anything other than gratitude and positivity. That's why I wonder if I should even bother opening up to my friends and family; knowing them, they'd do the exact same thing.



Sorry for the long rant. Perhaps a positive ending to counteract all that toxic nonsense: *Ahem*, I love all you guys so much! We got this as long as we believe in ourselves! WOO :DDD. ^^okay ^^let ^^me ^^throw ^^up ^^now

Just kissed the girl of which I thought was waaaay out of my league. I've really missed the feeling of happiness. FUCK YOU DEPRESSION



EDIT 1: Ok im going to present my story which isnt very special. I know her from a friends birthdayparty where we had a long talk about life and stuff. She was beautiful and I really liked her from the very beginning. As I mentioned I was 100% sure that she was way out of my league and I didnt even bother trying to flirt. I didnt want to go to (god bless I did) because I had a really shitty day. While being at the party I took some time of because I had a little down and she joined me and we began to chat. After the party me and a friend wanted to hang out and I didnt know that she was there as well. Soon my friend had to left and we were alone so we just talked casually. Afterwards I told her that I really enjoyed being with her and she answered with " I truly did as well" so I typed: " When will be the next time?" While writing that I kinda shitted myself because im such a coward. I sure to be denied but she said: "Why not tomorrow?" I was like wauw wtf and said "Sure!". Next day we decided to watch the naked gun and really enjoyed the movie. As she was about to leave I just grabbed all what was left of my pride and just went for it. Turned out that she is a very good kisser and I'm going to meet her again next week. If i wouldve not gone for it i wouldve hated myself as i do always when i back off while tryin to approach a girl. Thanks for all the comments and upvotes did not expect this big of an audience at all. Sorry for the bad english :D

This is something that's been really bothering me for a long while.



I just... dont care.  

And not in a good way. Not in a "things aren't going well but that's ok" way. It's more of a "I'm just too tired and lonely to feel any emotions" kind of thing.  

Nothing really makes me happy. The only person that made me feel anything is gone now. I don't really have any hobbies, I don't play video games. I distract myself from nothingness with a lot of music.  

It's been going on for years.



Everything is bleak.

I've been depressed for years, in the last six months it became severe, and I tried to kill myself. I haven't been able to concentrate or focus since. Today is the first day I've done any kind of schoolwork for half a year. I wrote a [whole page of notes](http://imgur.com/a/PwTZx) and studied for half an hour. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it's a huge win for me, and I wanted to share it with people who understand. I'm 16, and I dropped out of school last year because I couldn't do anything. Now I'm finally getting back on track :)

I realized a few days ago that I was suffering from maladaptive daydreaming for the last 10 years.For those who don’t know about [Maladaptive daydreaming](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiynrjw2MLLAhXQwY4KHZNAChkQFggbMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMaladaptive_daydreaming&usg=AFQjCNH7SXZedX3BicLpcZmzNWN4mTrJQg&bvm=bv.116636494,d.c2E&cad=rja)





Physically I was living one life and mentally I was living 3-4 versions of myself.This may sound ridiculous but it is true. All my life,I thought I had no dreams,aims,goals,aspirations or whatever.I was lackadaisical about most of the things in life.





During 8th grade, I started daydreaming.At that time I thought it was probably the best use I can make of my mind.I can be anyone I want.I can do anything I want.I can do this by just imagining stuff.For hours I dreamt about things that I wanted.At that time I wanted to be a footballer.





I would imagine playing for my favourite football club,playing for my country.All of those scenarios I made up my mind.I became lazier.The girl I had a crush on, I would imagine spending time with her.The same thing continued for 2-3 years. As I took admission in an average college,I started to imagine that I am in a top,well known college. Returning home after college, I resume my daydreaming again.





There was a point when I thought sleeping is a better option.I had 4-5 dreams per session of sleep. My life had become so boring that I used to sleep for about 20 hours so that I could have something interesting atleast in my dreams.The daydreaming was not going to end.

I had 3-4 versions of myself which I roleplayed in my mind.





1 a football player 



2.An ordinary citizen with a good job and a SO 



3.This roleplay was used by me for NSFW purposes.





After college,being indecisive as ever,these versions started influencing me. I spent more time daydreaming.After I failed to crack an exam required for higher education,I started daydreaming about successfully cracking that exam and taking admission to a new college. All the failures in my life were overshadowed by daydreaming.Maybe this is why I am jobless,with no life at all.I was as depressed as one can get. I tried to quit this habit of daydreaming.





All the characters that I created in my fantasies spoke with me all the time. I try to avoid them as much as I can, but they have become a part of me.





As of now I have’nt daydreamed for a day and this probably is the longest I’ve gone.Thank you for reading this and no I don’t have suicidal thoughts

You have no idea why you've caught it. It closes all programs as soon as they open. You get a snippet of hope as you see the program opening in the taskbar, only to be immediately let down as it closes itself. 



You're left staring into a desktop background it has made just for you: dark and hopeless and sad. 



You avoid even turning on your computer, opting to just stay in sleep mode for most of the day.



You feel ashamed of being the only one who can't seem to shake this virus and avoid anyone seeing your shame.



To strangers or friends you act like its functioning fine, pretending to relate to their small talk. You are perpetually isolated.



To the few you do tell about the problem, you find them laughing it off, telling you to reboot or just open a new program - as if you haven't tried that already. 



The frustration is intense. A handful promise it will disappear on its own. Another few recommend antivirus software that you struggle to buy, let alone activate successfully. 



You feel desperate and alone, and seriously consider shutting down once and for all.



But the promise that maybe one day programs will open, maybe some miracle will occur, leaves you staring into the desktop abyss, numb and alone, writing clunky horrible metaphors on the back of your hand.

No one will probably care and it probably sounds trivial but tonight I kissed a girl for the first time. It was something I never thought would happen. I was super awkward about it, but I'm trying to tell myself that doesn't matter. It was with someone I actually care about too and she didn't think being kissless at 20 was too weird at all. Or so she said. The thoughts of over analyzing are starting to take over but I'm fighting to give myself this one moment of happiness and to share the hope with you guys. I know their are people who are older and in the same situation. It will be awkward but it is not impossible and you can do it. The mantra that got me through it was "the first five seconds are the hardest part and after that it's natural". All I had to do was tell her id never been kissed and the rest would just flow from there, even if it was awkward and cringe worthy. Don't lose hope guys, never lose hope :)

LIFE HACKS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS



Hello, it has been with some interest that I have read many articles on this topic on a variety of websites. All of the advice I have viewed has been helpful.

I have suffered with both depression and anxiety and I thought I might share some of the stuff I have found useful over the past 15 years.



Some of the points I will make have been made by others and published on the net, but they do bear repeating as they are practical and have utility, others I haven’t seen in print before. 



When unwell I experience a state where even showering, preparing food, answering the phone or checking the mail is actually traumatic – so, when sick, I avoid these activities. Generally this only worsens my situation, so I developed a number of hacks to assist myself. I hope some people find these helpful.



Often when we are depressed, anxious  or paranoid our brains sink into negativity and utilize catastrophic thinking which can be overwhelming and further reinforces and maintains the distress we experience. This can be further worsened when basic duties like washing up, caring for yourself etc. go by the wayside.



If you are not familiar with Maslow’s pyramid I would recommend you Google it and have a basic understanding of the principles as a lot of the advice I will give will make more sense if you do.





EATING:



In depression it is common for simple tasks to be overwhelming and for appetite to be diminished. This is, perhaps, an evolutionary by-product where the body senses it has lost equilibrium and from its “point of view” sensibly drops your appetite so energy can go into the immune system or the flight and flight response. This reflex is great if you have the flu or you need to run away from a zombie, it is not at all helpful in depression or anxiety or the negative syndrome of schizophrenia. Ever single neurotransmitter in our brains that is used to maintain mood and assist us to deal with distress comes from substrates in our diet. We cannot manufacture serotonin, noradrenaline or dopamine without precursors from our diet. Currently almost all anti-depressants and anti-psychotics work by essentially making your natural store of these chemicals work longer and harder, usually by blocking their destruction or re-uptake back into the brain cells or by altering the sites where these molecules work. So it is important to keep up some basic nutrition and regular meals. Psychologically it is also a powerful message to your brain (whether the conscious or unconscious aspects) that you are capable of looking after your survival needs and at some level will improve your self esteem and trust in yourself that even when faced with adversity your have the inner resilience to look after yourself. There is an American study in which they took fit, young mentally stable people with no history of mental illness and starved them. Almost all met criteria for major depression, most also met criteria for anxiety problems and a disturbing number were suicidal by the end of the study. So please continue to eat well.



1.	Pack your pantry and freezer with healthy easy to prepare meals. Always go for the least processed option and try to avoid white sugar and especially white flour. Soups, baked beans etc are a good start but I’ll let you generate your own list. The priorities here are to get stuff that is non-perishable, easy to prepare with a minimum of effort and provides decent nutrition.

2.	Have an emergency supply that will last at least a week that you don’t use unless you have to, so if your mental health does decompensate you are stocked up.

3.	Get yourself a supply of Paper plates, bowls, baking dishes, and cutlery. Biodegradable products are freely available and the ones made out of strengthen paper can be reused if not soiled. This allows you to eat with some dignity without having to worry about the washing up as you can dispose of everything afterwards. This is not optimal for the environment but we are looking at temporary hacks while you are unwell.

4.	Likewise purchase disposal oven baking trays. Aluminum is fine but the biodegradable reinforced paper ones are best as come with plastic lids so cooked food can be placed straight into the refrigerator once cool. 

5.	Have one of those heavy plastic under-the-bed storage boxes that can fix nicely in a cupboard under the sink or on the kitchen bench. Half fill it with water, detergent and salt. Deposit everything that cannot be thrown into the waste in it after a general rinse to remove food. This soaking will remove all grease etc. and with a lid will not invite bugs/flies/mold or smell.

6.	When full, fill your sink with water deposit the items in it. Rinse and then allow to dry. This way there are never any used dishes around your house or filling up your sink to lower your self esteem further and if surprise people should visit the place continues to look reasonably ok.

7.	Supplements such as a multi-vitamin, high dose fish oil and a multi B vitamin all have some evidence and worth considering if your diet is insufficient.

8.	Protein shakes make a great meal if you cannot stomach the idea of eating solid food. Ensure you get one with soluble fiber and a good amino-acid profile. As you want to limit the amount of effort and cleaning required purchase a product that readily dissolves when simply shaken or stirred so no mixing device is required.

9.	This way keeping a clean and ordered kitchen should only require about ten minutes effort about once a week if you live by yourself.



CLOTHES



There is something quite disheartening, when your self-esteem is crap, to have to go out and the only clean clothes you have are a mismatched outfit, while everything else you own is littered around your house on the floor. Go out of your way to buy clothes that don’t need to be dry-cleaned or ironed.



First things first, you want to divide your clothes into three groups. Almost everyone regardless of their coloring looks good in dark colors; the black and grey spectrum. Likewise most people look good in the white/light colour spectrum. I am paler than an albino polar bear so warm colours like red/orange/yellow make me look and feel like a weeping sore while I do look good in the cold spectrum of green/blue/purple. Decide which colour spectrum really suits you. Ask for advice if you are unsure. 



Rearrange your clothes cupboard along these colour lines. If you don’t have a lot of space or money then buying cheap but sturdy boxes from a storage place then tape them together so they function like a multi level cupboard and cover with a nice sheet or decorative throw.



Put all of your white underpants/socks/t-shirts and causal pants in one box. Fill another with your darks and another with your colours.



Hang up all your shirts, coats, jumpers and pants etc etc grouped by colour in your wardrobe.



The aim here is to ensure that when you wear an outfit EVERYTHING you have on can be washed together.



At the end of the day, instead of throwing everything into your dirty linen basket or on the floor just deposit everything into the washing machine directly. Continue to choose items from the same colour grouping until the washing machine is full. Then throw in the cleaning products and press the button. This way there is never any dirty clothes lying around the house or sitting unwashed, getting smelly, in a basket. It also eliminates the task of separating whites from darks etc. and limits the need to do multiple loads.



Then just throw them in the dryer. For one person this should mean that you only need to do one to two loads of washing a week and you already have an organized system of boxes to put the dry clothes away. This should take up about 30- 45 minutes of work a week. It also relieves you of having to look at mess that will further lower your mood. It will also give a powerful message to your brain that even if you are depressed you can still get things done. Not to mention, looking at increasing mounds of dirty clothes can overwhelm you with the prospect of work, which can make it, more unlikely you will clean.



Use this same principle with your Manchester.



BUY IN BULK AND STOCK PILE.



They is no greater insult to feeling good then running out of toilet paper, and when depressed it can be insurmountable to get dressed and go to the shops to buy stuff while at the same time you are hating on yourself for running out. If you use a bit of smarts you can stockpile essentials with little cost.



Parents/ friends/charities etc for a 30-50 voucher for shopping. If they are concerned you might waste the money advise them to buy vouchers that cannot be spent on alcohol or cigarettes.



Buy enough of the following to last a month, at least:

•	Toilet paper

•	Tooth paste

•	Soap

•	Deodorant

•	Shaving cream and razors

•	Shampoo and conditioner – but there are great ways to make your own.

•	General cleaning products

•	Laundry products.

Then every time you are able to go shopping only ever buy these items when on sale.  Buy these even if you have an oversupply. It is often ridiculous how cheap these items can be when on sale or a new product is available and they want to promote it.



If you don’t have storage for these products get some boxes for free from shopping outlets  (at time of writing Bunnings and Dan Murphy’s generally have an oversupply of boxes for the public) and store them under sofas, beds, or in the back of cupboards. You will never run out of essentials again.



STOP ALL UNWANTED phone calls/visits and mail.



Get a sign for your mailbox stating no unsolicited or junk mail. Cannot afford one? Create one on a public library computer, print it off and get them to laminate it. It should only cost a couple of dollars.



Do the exact same thing for your front door. Make it polite and simple. “No visitors requesting charity/money/surveys/ promoting politics, religion etc. 



Place your phone number on the “no-call” list for surveys/sales/insurance etc. If you have a mobile phone then use it, if possible, as your only point of contact for family/friends/health care providers/work and turn off voice mail and activate the mechanism where every voice message has to be transferred into text. Anyone who rings you for something unimportant won’t bother leaving a message and if someone does it is often less intimidating, when you are consumed with anxiety, to read a text then listen to a message.



RESEARCH METHODS ON HOW TO KEEP YOUR PLACE CLEAN WITH MINIMAL EFFORT.



I won’t detail ever hack here as there is so much great info out there but I’ll list some things I have found very helpful.



If, like me, you find yourself essentially living on the couch or your bed when unwell then you will be familiar at how disorganized and dirty these areas can become when you eat, smoke etc etc in the same local for days at a time. 



For any area you normally snuggle and remain in for a while get some ultra cheap bath mats or even single bed sheets from a second hand store. You can usually get these for a few bucks. Place them on the floor so it completely surrounds the area. This way you won’t need to vacuum or worry about crumps etc. When you have the energy and it is getting dirty. Lift it up by its corners so all debris is safely caught and shake it outside. If possible have more than one for each area so if you do ruin it you can just throw the entire thing out and still have a spare.



Buy one of those streak free no scrub shower products. Every time you have a shower spray everything at the end. The next time you shower the entire place will sparkle with NO EFFORT. Do this at the end of every shower.



We all have socks that we need to get rid of. Don’t. Every morning after your shower drop a bit of floor cleaner or eucalyptus oil on the floor and go over the bathroom floor while wearing your “cleaning socks”. Don’t have any? Buy them for a dollar at a cheap or second hand stop. Every morning squirt the toilet bowl with a toilet cleaner and just leave it until the next time you use it. This way your bathroom should generally be presentable and clean. This is very mood lifting when you need to use it and a big comfort if someone drops round. Most people will forgive a messy house but expect the silent judgment treatment if they need to use your bathroom and it resembles something at a truck stop. This should take an extra five minutes of work a day.



After coming out of a very severe bout of depression I was ashamed at how filthy my place was. Get a bin for every single room you frequently use. Plastic shopping bags are free and work just great. Have one everywhere hanging on a door knob or the edge of furniture. When you don’t have the motivation to get off the couch your waste can be put in the bag and when you do have five minutes of energy instead of having to pick up a whole lot of junk from the floors throughout your place or vacuum you only need to collect all the bags and place in the council pick up bin. Voila in five minutes there are no empty packages of food, ciggie boxes, milk bottles etc. littered throughout your apartment.



DO SOMETHING EVERY SINGLE DAY



Every day do at least one thing from the following list:

•	Something for pleasure that does not involve drugs/alcohol or anything else dangerous to your mood. On days where everything is “too hard” then this might just be re-watching a favourite TV show or movie or listening to the radio, on other days go for a walk etc. etc. I won’t give a list. You know what you like, I don’t

•	Do a duty. This is stuff that might not be fun but has to be done. Always set this task to your level of motivation and energy. If you are consumed with distress and overwhelmed then just pick a single fork from your dishes, waiting to be washed, and wash and dry it and put in the draw.

•	Link up with someone who genueilly cares for you. If you don’t have the energy to talk, then send a text or a Facebook message or email or something similar. Write a card and send it. But stay connected. If you have no energy then write it in such a way to dis-invite an immediate return phone call or follow up texts. It is OK to stretch the truth – although I never recommend lying as it sets up damaging programs in your subconscious. “Hi just texting to say I love you/ thinking of you/ hope you and your family are going well etc etc. I’m about to collapse into bed speak soon”. Obviously if you are in a more powerful or confident state then actually do ring someone. If you don’t feel you have any friends or family then join an internet chat room for people with mental illness that is well moderated (Beyond Blue is the best site, in my opinion) and just chat to a stranger – you never know this may develop into an internet friendship that continues to bring much into your life.



The purposes of these actions are multiple. One of the reasons for adopting such a structure is that it can utilize as little as five minutes with minimal energy but feeds a powerful message that you still are a capable person who can get things moving towards full functioning – YES even if you just wash a spoon. Setting yourself tasks and completing them is essentially the only way to genuinely improve your confidence and skill level. Even if you need to start small…. every journey start with the first single step. Always congratulate yourself for every single task you achieve – no matter how small.





IF ON MEDICATION



Do not run out. Most pharmacies will allow you to purchase more than one script at a time if you explain to them that you won’t be able to get back in time to refill your next one.  Ask your doctor for some sample packs with your scripts. Save these. So if you find yourself in the situation that your meds have run out and you are too unwell to go to the doctor or pharmacy you have backups. A lot of pharmacies will happily keep your scripts on file and for a small fee send out your meds when you are getting low – especially online businesses.





FOR WHEN VISITORS INSIST ON COMING OVER



If you have put in place the “bin in every room hack then all it takes is about 3 minutes to collect and deposit all of them in the council bin. Your house may need vacuuming or dusting but it won’t be littered with rubbish. Have some cheap but pleasant incense or aerosol / spray bottle essential oils to remove that “lived in” aroma within seconds. 



 Have an emergency box for visitors. Don’t use the contents unless you absolutely must and if so replace them. It can be awkward and embarrassing when people drop by and you have to basically tell them “sorry I have nothing to offer you”.



What I have in my box?



•	Samples of good quality tea both normal and herbal. These can often be picked up at hospitals/hotels etc or when round at your parents or friends comment that the tea they served was fantastic and would it be ok to take two or three bags. If they are foil sealed wonderful. If not cover in foil or put in zip lock bag.

•	Smallest bottle possible of a decent instant coffee.

•	Long life milk/unrefrigerated soy or nut milk.

•	Sugar and artificial sweetener samples. These can often be picked up at any coffee shop or eatery for free.

•	A nice teacup with saucer and a clean coffee mug (so you don’t have to scramble to clean anything).

•	A packet of decent biscuits

•	Two or three cans of beer (This is for visitors)

•	Frozen chips and finger food that can be heated within 15 minutes in the oven in your disposable oven tray and served up in a disposable bowl.

•	Another winner is to have a packet of corn chips, jar of salsa and shredded cheese (stored in the freezer). Bang it all together on a large disposal plate pop in microwave and within three minutes – simple but delicious nachos.

•	Microwavable popcorn.

This way if someone does drop by you are ALWAYS in a position to offer him or her a snack and a drink. I am sure you will be able to create a selection that would suit your friends and family. Don’t spend too much and keep it simple.



OH GOD OH GOD IT IS SOMEONE’s birthday/anniversary etc.



It is not uncommon for these things to sneak up on you when all your energy is going into keeping your head above water. Again those two-dollar shops are a lifesaver.

In this box I generally have:

•	A number of blank cards – so I can use them for any situation. Pictures of beautiful scenery or cute animals generally cover any situation and can be picked up for about a dollar.

•	Wrapping paper – again buy on special or after a holiday event has passed and shops are selling Xmas paper at about 90% off. No one is going to mind if their birthday present is wrapped in green and red.

•	A mix of cheap but useful gifts. It is difficult to offer advice here as everyone has different people with different tastes in their life. No one wants a box of chocolates or socks though.

•	I keep a cheap but really delicious red and white wine bottle. (ask around and talk to alcohol shop assistants)

•	Handmade soap from markets

•	Some scratch lottery tickets (the one dollar kind)

•	Some stamps

•	Some nice stationary.



This way you always have on hand the ability to send a card to someone, maybe slip in a scratchie, or write a letter on nice stationary about how much you value them (often more meaningful than any present). And if you need to go to a party you have a bottle of wine some nice soap and whatever else you have on hand to use as a gift.



Other useful gifts could be good balsamic vinegar or make your own garlic or chili infused olive oil in a decorative bottle from a two-dollar shop.  None of these go out of date and can save your bacon when you are under pressure.



GROOMING



Boy doesn’t this go by the wayside when depression hits. I’m the unlucky type of person that if I don’t clean my face twice a day I break out – and I’m in my forties! Also if I go more than three days without washing my hair I get big globs of dandruff.



•	Get a pot/package of disposal face wipes and keep in your bedroom and lounge room – placed discretely away in a draw. Experimentation will demonstrate which one works best for you. Even though I have very sensitive skin the Clearasil one is fantastic for me – but it is pricey. I always stock up when it is on special. You can also make your own (recipes on the net) but make sure you put in a decent antibacterial preservative. Tea Tree oil is great. When I don’t have the energy or motivation to shower I use these twice a day and have never had a breakout no matter how long I don’t shower.

•	If you need to go out or someone drops by your skin always looks clean and clear.

•	Waterless shampoo marketed for campers is sort of OK.

•	A great way to get rid of dandruff in one shower is to mix your shampoo 50/50 with baking soda, leave on for a few minutes then rewash in plain shampoo. My hair looks great even though it was dull and lifeless five minutes previously.

•	Either make your own or buy cheap antibacterial mouthwash. Have one in the kitchen, laundry and bathroom. If you can’t be bothered brushing your teeth (which is ALWAYS the best option) at least you can destroy all the tartar bacteria and clean your breath in seconds and it is better than doing nothing.

•	If you cannot get out of bed some body wipes are great for the armpits. You might not be cleaning your whole body but will significantly decrease your personal smell, which is good on many, many levels – especially if you get guests or need to go out.



If you don’t regularly clean your body bacteria and skin debris can build up and weaken the skin, so a daily shower is always the best option but an antibacterial body moisturizer can keep your skin looking supple and kill off fungus/bacteria. Just buy a dirt-cheap sorbolene cream and add some tea tree oil to it. Stress areas such as elbows, knees, hands and feet can be covered in about a minute and you will feel and look better for it.



I have an enormous list of other hacks that are useful in mental illness, especially on pet and garden care, and how to maintain friendships and family connections when all you want to do is crawl into bed and not communicate with anyone, which I will type up for another article if this one proves helpful.



There is obviously no decent substitute for proper eating, cleaning, washing and grooming – but as people with mental illness know often it is impossible or extremely challenging to keep up with normal duties. I hope some of these hacks are helpful for some people. I have no doubt that not all of them will be suitable or appropriate for everyone and of course each could be criticized on some level. The purpose of this article is not to promote laziness or habitual behavior but to offer suggestions on how to cope and function at a higher level (even if only marginally) then just being curled up in bed and doing nothing. Mental illness is often not curable but it is very treatable. These tips are intended simply as a stepping-stone on the way back to wellbeing and better functioning.

So I'm looking up some side effects on the meds I'm taking and I laughed way too hard at this.





**Major Side Effects**



You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking this drug:



- Coma



Yeah, I'll make sure to check with him on that for sure.

This is not view baiting or asking for advice about reddit, I just have a strong "the other reindeer" feeling I need to vent. I don't understand how some threads get thousands of upvotes, while Im lucky to have one person reading mine. I suppose it's exactly like real life anyway, what am I even hoping to expect. 



Still alive, trying not to die, not to 'finish the job' tonight

I am a dipshit.  I don't suffer from depression.  I've known my wife 10 years, lived with her for 8, married for 7, and I'm just beginning to pull my head out of my ass and understand how she thinks and suffers with depression.



And I'm just astonished how obtuse I've been - me - the touchy-feely, helper-of-the-disabled, captain empathy, father of a disabled child, master's degreed, complete dipshit.



Hopefully I can pass along a few insights to help others avoid some pitfalls of the condition heretofore known as "Dipshittery".  It'll be in the DSM-VI I'm pretty sure.



You (the Dipshit) will say the following (bold) and they (the individual suffering depression) should reply:



**1. "You SHOULD just… [feel better] [change your attitude] [appreciate blah blah blah] [stop being so blah blah blah].**



Really?  No shit.  All the therapy.  All the medication.  And it never crossed my fucking mind to just stop.  You, dipshit, are a goddamn genius.  Who would've thought it could be so easy.



**2. "Why can't you just be…[happy] [appreciative] [positive]"**



…for the same reason some people don't survive a gunshot to the head and others do.  JUST BECAUSE.  That's why.  You think I signed up for this shit?  You think I was first in line to swallow the "feel shitty about self for no good reason" pill?  You truly are a dipshit if you think I CAN but simply WON'T change my state of mind.



Can you change from being such a shithead?  Go ahead, show me how it's done Captain Intellect.



**3. "Why can't you be happy for me?"**



Umm… because being happy isn't something I do well and you're success likely spotlights one of my many real or imagined shortcomings.  



Yes… I'm a bit self-absorbed.  It's kind of the definition of depression dipshit… to be focused on the self.  Just not in a good way… more in a, "how do I make it through the day in one piece."  So I'm busy right now trying to not sabotage myself with negative self-thought.



So sorry if I'm too preoccupied to wave a banner because you're happy about something.



**4. "Focus on all the good things."**



Read #1 again, dipshit.



- - - - - - - - - - 



So, Dipshit, are you starting to get it?  You're dealing with a hyper-sensitive creature and absolutely NONE of your standard dipshit lines and philosophies are going to help.



You wanna' help?  Probably not.  Then leave and do everyone a favor.  But I have kids so I HAD to figure it out (or I would've likely taken the first train to Happy Town.)



You REALLY wanna' help?  Then when your friend/partner starts going to crazy town, realize that…



* Making rational arguments, connecting the dots, providing data… it's pointless.  Completely pointless so shut up.  We're not in that place right now, so don't bring your pithy marshmallows to an emotional inferno.



* How about reminding them that, "Hey, I'm sure you don't like feeling this way.  On the long list of potential emotional responses, I'm sure your current one isn't at the top of your list either.  Don't sweat it.  I get it - sorta'."  



At times they're going to take it out on you, but it isn't about you.  Check your ego at the door.



* Since you don't have the manual on "The Right Emotion for Every Situation," maybe you can just lay off a bit?  You know they're being crazy.  They know they're being crazy.  There needs to be some "crazy space".  They'll come back from it and appreciate your understanding and compassion.  You might even get laid.



* Why don't you use this as an opportunity to check YOUR massive ego.  Is there a cosmic law that states you deserve fair treatment, or to be heard, or to be represented accurately?  



Ummm… I just checked with Neil deGrasse Tyson.  He says you deserve two things in the cosmos: JACK and SHIT.  



Ditch the ego.  You're going to die, your thoughts and ideas are all bullshit you tell yourself, and in the end nothing matters beyond how you've treated people.  So stop talking, throw down a hug, let a brother know you're on their side.  You might even get laid.



* If they had a flesh-eating bacteria and wanted to cry about it, you'd be His Royal Provider of Empathy and All Things Comforting.  You would NEVER say your typical dipshit lines.  



So, if you need to, pretend they have a happiness-eating bacteria in their brain.  Then maybe you can stop being such a dick.



- - - - - - -



I'm still a dipshit.  I don't have all the answers.  But I'm trying to survive and create a positive, nuturing, loving culture in my house.  I don't have control over how my wife responds to situations.  But I have complete control over how I choose to respond.  So that's what I focus on.

So, yesterday I had a post talking about people saying suicide is selfish. Just like the title suggests, think twice before opening your mouth. I honestly believe when people spread their ignorence around this topic it will do the greatest harm. There is a stigma around any mental health issues and because of this people needing help won't reach out. They will feel the guilt and feel blamed. Before you say anything to someone who is hurting deep down you should do some research.  IT COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE. Someone sent me this quote and I couldn't agree more with it.





 David Foster Wallace once said:



"The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."

I came out to her in June and it's been hell living with her ever since. I am moving out starting tomorrow. I guess she thought today would be a good day to tell me everything she thought about me. She began yelling at me about how I can never be happy without god and that one day I will realize that. She also said "that's why you people are protesting all the time, you aren't happy without god," to which i responded with "we protest because there's millions of kids who kill themselves because they have parents like you." She said " if you wanna kill yourself, kill yourself." 

This happened while i was getting ready for my girlfriend's birthday dinner just now. But now I can't stop crying.



EDIT: I just want to thank everyone who took the time to respond to this post, regardless. I wanted to give a quick update today. I had a wonderful time with my girlfriend and her beautiful family, it was just what I needed. I'm currently in the process of moving and am surrounding myself with people who love and support me. Thank you everyone for your thoughts and advice.

So I met a girl about a month and half ago and we hit it off really well. apparently I did something right because she doesn't like dating. She's never had a boyfriend and she pretty much turned down everyone who has asked in the past. But she said yes to being my girlfriend.



But the most amazing part is what she said the other day. I told her in full confidence that I'm worried about letting people close because my depression and anxiety hurt people before. I told her everything. My suicidal thoughts. My self harm. My depressive episodes. And she just looked at me and said, "Well I knew all that going in and I still said yes." 



That was one of the most beautiful things I've heard in a while. Gave me the first genuine smile I've had in over a year.



EDIT: WOW! Holy shit, I go away for a day and this blew up! Thank you all so much. I hope all of you find success as well. X)



EDIT 2: Okay! I think I've responded to everyone! I hope all is well with you my friends!

Hello /r/drepression, 

my name is Lukas,

some of you may have read the post i made 30 days ago. I tried to take my own life and documented in this subreddit. after i went through different hospitals and had the worst and most painful night of my life i am recovered health-wise. I made this post to tell those who were actually worried that i am alright. I could some "It gets better"-bullshit here, but i am a terrible liar. I still want to die but i've learned that there are people whose happiness is worth more than my pain in living. I am in a psychiartric hospital in a stationary therapy and i would like to apollogise for being so discouraging in this subreddit. i am sorry. 



I wish you the best and ofc happiness since happiness is the most valueable thing for all of us. 



Thanks for your attention,

Lukas







Edit: Thank you for your kind words. It really helps me getting more positive and tryin to survive daily struggles.



Edit: Thank you guys really. i am emotionally moved by how much positive feedback i got.

I try on working my way into liking myself and finding a perspective to pursue. Thank you :)

...or even just sadness in general. He talks here about the grief of losing his father and two brothers in a plane crash when he was ten [(source)](http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/playboy-interview-stephen-colbert?page=3):



> The interesting thing about grief, I think, is that it is its own size. It is not the size of you. It is its own size. And grief comes to you. You know what I mean? I’ve always liked that phrase He was visited by grief, because that’s really what it is. Grief is its own thing. It’s not like it’s in me and I’m going to deal with it. It’s a thing, and you have to be okay with its presence. If you try to ignore it, it will be like a wolf at your door.



In the past I would always think of my self loathing as a symptom of something wrong with me. That is, I thought it was in me and I have to deal with it. And my repeated failures to deal with it just made me feel worse.



It's far more straightforward to want to attack the negative feelings I've held close for most my life. Get rid of the negativity. But the strategy that has actually worked best for me was to find happiness independent of my depression. And little by little, positive things took more and more focus, until the negative was no longer dominant. Relevant, yes, but not dominant.



Anyway, these are just thoughts I had that I thought might help others. Hopefully it helps.

Let's be clear: I fucking hate running. I don't mind sports and I enjoy team sports but it's been donkey years since I last properly exercised. My depression and anxiety also got worse over the years but correlation =/= causation. 



The last couple of days I've been outside walking around the streets catching Pokemon. I'm surprised by how *nice* it feels to be out in the sun getting some physical activity even if it's just walking.



I've also just landed myself a cool new job and I REALLY want to make it work. I'm already on medication and getting psychotherapy organised for myself but I've also started considering incorporating some actual exercise into my life. I absolutely would not have considered it if I hadn't been playing Pokemon GO. I'd much rather hide at home and play video games forever.



Today I went to the mall to buy some cheapo exercise pants (those stretchy thick yoga leggings) and shoes. I didn't want to drop $200 on a pair of Nikes just yet so I got a [$20 pair of running shoes](http://www.kmart.com.au/product/delilah-running-joggers/891009) instead. I think they look pretty damn sweet. :D I've been wearing heaps of black clothes (reflective of my mood lol) so a pop of bright colours would be good for a change I reckon.



Tomorrow I'm going to try and run/walk ~4km. More walking I think, to do some reconnaissance around the city and find a good running route. I'm actually looking forward to it. I also hope to hatch a couple of Pokemon eggs while I'm at it. :3 



I know I shouldn't put too much pressure on myself and *be patient with the recovery process* but I hope to keep this momentum up for as long as possible.



[Edit: Thank you everyone for your encouragement and support! I will do my best!! :')]



[Edit 2: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!]

Depression is something that, fortunately, not too many people suffer from. Unfortunately, that means that those who suffer from it are in the minority. This makes it a rarity that you'll come across someone who understands what you're going through when you tell them you have severe depression. 



Too often you'll get people who tell you to get over it, or you'll feel better if you smile. My brain feels like a holke I'm trapped in. I try to smile and be positive but keep getting sucked into despair by stupid triggers in my environment and myself (My impatience, when something or one is going slower than I like or just thinking about certain family members. When I'm triggered I have to struggle for about the next hour to get out of the pit of despair I fall inro.



That shows you depression is more than a mood to just get over. Depression and other mental disorders like anxiety and bipolar are disorders which little is known about and no one will talk about. I want this to change. I want to have an open discussion about how society sees mental illness. The only rule is no one insult anyone else in this discussion.

I understand this is an extremely morbid title and perhaps I'm wrong, maybe I am truly just projecting my experience on to him. But something clicked in my mind as of late.



My friend was an extremely outgoing person. He was loved by everyone he met, always a smile on his face. He cared about everybody and most importantly he cared about himself. He had the biggest ego out of anyone I knew, always talking about how he's the #1 this or #1 that.



I remember talking to him about being more attractive, especially to girls. He gave me advice about going to the gym, how to make your personality better. Basically how to have a positive attitude like his own.



Then, in September of last year, he jumped off the balcony of his apartment which was on the 30-something floor.



This shocked everyone. I honestly thought it was a joke when my friends told me the first time. They had to repeat themselves multiple times to register it in my head.



This guy. The guy who was basically my role model and close friend just died... By his own hands. It made no sense.



Why? Why would he do this? He seemed happy, he was going to school to do what he loved it made no sense.



The morning he did it, he sent an email to my friend. It was worded poorly, I'm sure his brain was not fully functioning at that point. He said his goodbyes, that he was sorry, that he was being selfish. All that stuff.



But he wrote something that I didn't really put into consideration at all and that was the fact that he said he truly wasn't sad. That he was simply done.



I didn't get it at all, I mean I did to an extent but I couldn't understand how a guy like him would just say "Fuck it" and end it all like that.



But then recently I've been going through a ton of personal growth. I'm seeing the world through new eyes and honestly through a lens I feel like he was looking through too. Because I have been striving to become the best person I can, to become number one, to have a great personality, to improve myself to the best I can.



And like I said, something connected.



The fact that I'm doing all of this shit. All of this work. For what? Why? The more I improve myself, the shittier everything seems. I work so hard just to suffer through a shit job, or a shit class or a shit relationship, a shitty everything. I have to maintain a fake as fuck frame, pretending everything is so cool and great when in reality I'm stressed, probably sick in some form and not to mention over all just lonely.



And that's just the thing.



It's being lonely. Maybe he wasn't lonely, maybe he was just truly done. But I feel like that's the thing that pushed him over. And it's not a silly "Boo-hoo I have nobody to talk to" or a "Friends aren't talking to me at this moment" kind of lonely. It's the kind of crippling loneliness that comes from realizing that nothing matters. That nobody matters. YOU don't matter, she doesn't matter, he doesn't matter, nothing matters. Nobody owes you anything. 



And at first this thought process was freeing.



Wow! Nothing matters? Nice! Of course this didn't mean I went around punching people or breaking laws, but it opened my eyes up to how I could become someone better. That because nothing really matters, I shouldn't worry about things as much. That there's no reason to stress over what I say, what I do, how I act. Just to loosen up and have fun.



This was great. My ego went through the roof adopting this nihilistic point of view. And not in a necessarily negative way, I just felt GOOD to be ME. Which was surprising and addictive... But eventually lead to me feeling like this.



Once I started working on me, me and more of me I started looking around. I stopped putting people on a pedestal and realized that people fucking suck. I very might as well be one of those super sucky people, but from my point of view I'm somewhat decent.



I realized how empty and shallow people are. That people basically go for looks or a loud/obnoxious personality. And I understand many people step all over the whole defending of being a "nice guy" sort of thing, but stepping out of those lines and becoming a somewhat obnoxious guy that only cares about himself and his looks just sucks.



I become one of those people I view as empty and I hate it. But it terrifies me to step down and go back into a position where I was constantly being stepped on and literally abused. This is creating a tear in my personality and life, making things ridiculously difficult.



And this is where I feel like he gave up. And I can't blame him. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm told to just "be my self" but when I am I'm ignored and used. When I put on a persona, walk around doing some act I feel empty...



What the hell am I supposed to even do?



Adding this on top of the stresses of growing up, watching my friends suffer because they're too poor to even afford food on some days. Seeing that the planet is going to shit, the government is being ran by people that don't give a shit about the average person, that people are (as a whole) are simply vain and predictable.



It just sucks. It seems so nice to just be rid of it.



I'm not planning to end it, I'm just venting. I have so much more to say but I've already written an essay. I miss my friend so much and wouldn't ever do that to my friends.



But like I've seen so many times on this sub, "I don't want to kill myself, but I'd love to stop existing".



Thanks if you read all this, it's quite a lot. It's also pretty early where I am. I have a flight in a few hours and wanted to get this off my chest. I hope life is treating all of you well.

As my depression has worsened over the past year, I've noticed a few things:



I can't read a book anymore, because I can't commit to sitting down and enjoying it; I've put off reading for so long that now it feels more like a nagging obligation than a pleasure.



I can't read online articles, or even longer Reddit comment threads anymore, my eyes start reading and just lose interest and trail off, barely even skimming the page.







I have to force myself to write Reddit comments with any substance.



I've stopped studying Chinese, even just the flashcards are too taxing for me.



I don't want to play any video games anymore.



I have an ever-growing list of new music on Spotify to listen to.



I have downloaded movies that I tell myself "I'll watch eventually."



I can't do even the most ridiculously simple shit on my long-standing, still intact to-do list, like filing away screenshots I've taken or reading Reddit comments I've saved "to read later." 



I just don't care about anything that requires even minimal thought or effort anymore.

She had me list reasons that I actually like myself instead of reasons that I hate myself. She suggested that I write them down on notecards and tape them around my apartment. I just wanted to share what I'd made so far with /r/depression. [You can find them here and I'll try to update them as I make more.](http://imgur.com/a/74u1O) I really recommend trying this for all of you.

I've become so apathetic about things that should really matter in life. When I think about things like failing uni, losing relationships, messing up my future etc. all I feel is a kind of numbness. I truly can't bring myself to care. I used to be so anxious about these things all the time, I used to feel physically ill. But now I go through life feeling numb and grey. I can't be bothered getting help because I don't really care about getting better. 



But...the smallest thing can set off a full meltdown and suddenly I feel the weight of every failure on my back. Burn the last piece of toast and suddenly I'm hysterically crying about how I'm going to fail uni and ruin my future and I'm such a worthless idiot etc etc. 



I don't understand why I can't make myself care when I need to or in any meaningful way. At least when I'm anxious I am working hard and trying to make/keep friendships etc.

Thoughts like these creep into my mind every now and then, and they always make me feel more like shit than I was already. I feel like I should be proactive and try to fix myself, but I have no idea what to do or how to do it. Everything's just so difficult...



Not looking for advice, just wanted to share.



EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, guys! It's great to know I'm not alone.

Last night, around 5pm, I'd just finished watching a few movies, 1 for a media class and 2 for... well just to watch a movie, Don Jon, The Tree Of Life and Her.



 After watching I sat outside watching the sunset whilst having a cigarette and I thought about The Tree Of Life. There's a scene where Sean Penn is walking through a desert and sees all his childhood friends and himself as a child, and I thought of just what I was looking at in front of me. The sun, the birds, the cobwebs in the corners of the rail and I thought.... what exactly is it that I am doing here? What impact am I making? Do I even really matter? 



I feel empty. A deep vast hole full of nothing, nothing at all.



I go upstairs, trudging along, zombie-like, my mind is blank, tears are rolling down my face. Why am I crying? I have no idea. I never cry. I just don't. But here I am, walking up my stairs, crying. I have no weed. I know that alcohol will only make it worse, like always, so I head to the medicine cabinet, craving something to make me feel again. To make me feel happy, to make me feel.... anything..... I find some Panadol (paracetamol) and just start taking them. I'm counting them in my hand. 1...2....3.....4..... it keeps going until they're all gone. I get to 22, the packet says 'maximum 4 caps a day', next to the parent's bathroom where I start looking through the draws. Looking.....loooking...looking.... I strike gold. Temazepam.



I know from my Psychology class exactly what Benzodiazepines are. I take the entire packet. 17, down the hatch. 17 10mg pills. I text my 3 best friends, I say my final words, tell them I love them and that everything I own is theirs and that I'll always be there for them, even if they can't see me, I'll be there. 





I turn off the lights in my room and feel myself drift into the darkness.



Drifting..... listlessly.....



Until I feel myself being shaken violently, I can see the lights on and my dad's face. He's yelling at me, telling me one of my friends was so worried that he rang him and told him everything. He sees the packets lying on my desk and, as a medical professional, goes pale.



I'm in my boxer shorts and he drags me out of my room and throws me in the car yelling at my mum to drive me to the hospital. 



The car trip feels like it lasts less than a second as I drift in and out of consciousness and my dad holds my in the back seat.



We reach the emergency room and my dad is telling the lady exactly what's happened and explaining exactly what to do, seeing as he's a medical professional and works at the hospital. They drag me off to a bed and I can see my parents sitting in the waiting room, crying, as I feel hands clipping cathodes all over my body, putting me in a gown and sticking an IV in my arm as I lapse into unconsciousness, picturing all my friends faces laughing with me. 



I vaguely remember various random moments when I came to consciousness occasionally, but otherwise I woke up later on. I looked down and saw wires out of me, a needle in my arm and sticky pads all over my torso. I felt normal. I felt fine. I felt disappointed. Disappointed that I'd stolen someone else's bed, someone who actually needed it, not some stupid kid. I didn't want to be saved. I looked around for something sharp, for anything, tried using the name-tags around my wrist to cut, but it wasn't any use, they'd taken them all away. 



A nurse came and told me that there would be a psychiatrist come and see me in a few hours, checked my blood pressure, oxygen levels and heart rate and told me brekky was in an hour or two and to just rest up.



I had a shower right before I spoke to the psychiatrist and I looked in the mirror and saw the entire left-side of my body covered in sticky pads and cathodes where they'd measured all my readings and I just.... broke down.... I was pathetic.... I lay on the ground of the hospital shower sobbing uncontrollably at the pathetic mess I am. Absolutely. Pathetic. And you know what? The night before just felt like a dream.... I was still just a pathetic mess. 





I spoke to the psychiatrists and told them absolutely everything and went out and met my crying parents who took me home.



I met my friends later, all of them in tears hugged me for hours.





I'm sorry this is so long I just feel I had to talk about what happened because I was.....well....dead......





EDIT: Thank you all so much for your comments and support, I hope that my story can help some of you to get out of the 'hole' we're in all and to talk to someone. Thank you all again so much, you have no idea how much your comments mean to me, truly, thank you.

You become more perceptive of the world.



More analytical, you just see things others don't.



You see the bad things, all the bad things. That one guy that said one innocent little statement? You saw more than that, you saw a passive-aggressive jab; so subtle, but it's there. No one else saw it, except you. Do you bring it up? They get defensive, all on-lookers see is you getting confrontational about something that "doesn't matter".



You look at political debates. You see how gracefully they inject buzzwords and specific stimuli in their sentences to arouse things in people. You see the very moment in people's eyes light up when that particular buzzword is said.



You realize how ungenuine everyone is. You cringe every time you hear someone ask "How are you?" You get angry at the nuances of cheesy radio commercials and consumerism.



You notice how everyone is on auto-pilot, keeping an ear out for conditioned stimuli with a predictable response.



You notice all these things, you try to express how things could be different. You get passively ignored, or worse ostracized



And god forbid you express any sort of genuine emotion. No no, we have to be "le funny meme ironic comedians". GOD FORBID!



I can't fucking take this anymore. I can't fucking belong to any community, or bond with 99% of people.



This is a god damn hell and I'm so fucking lonely. It's hard to be specific, its everywhere I go in life.

I got out of bed. I showered. I brushed my teeth. I got dressed.



It took a really long time, and I have nothing to do all day...but it feels fucking good.

I've stopped feeling like I have any personality. Only friends who I've known for a very long time know that I'm a real person, but whenever I meet new people, I feel like I'm that friend-of-a-friend who people meet and then say "Wow, so-and-so's friend really had no personality, did they?" 



I'm so fucking exhausted and anxious most of the time, I can't hold a conversation. I just sit around and let everyone else do the talking with each other. I don't feel like a real person when I'm around anyone other than my two older friends because they're the only ones who know that I actually do have some sort of personality lying around somewhere. 



If I do meet anyone with interests similar to mine, my anxiety keeps me from starting a conversation with them.

I'm so tired of all of this. I miss being able to function like a normal person. (If I ever was able to, to begin with)



Edit: It feels so good to see that there are other people going through this and to see others talking to each other and trying to help each other out in the comments.

“Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.

Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.”



Excerpt From: Dickens, Charles. “A Tale of Two Cities.”

I feel pretty good right now, guys. Just a little bit of info, I've been self harming since I was 10. For 7 years I've never worn short sleeves outside because I was afraid that someone would find out or judge me because of it.



Today, I'm finally ending this cycle of self harm. I've kept myself clean and resisted urges for 2 years, waiting for the day I could finally replace the scars with something I love: books. Specifically, a literary tattoo!



Here's a comparison photo (warning: may be triggering, contains scar photos): https://i.imgur.com/wObD7Hk.jpg It's only half done, but I felt like sharing anyway!



The lightbulb is inspired by Anthem by Ayn Rand, the moth by The Death of the Moth by Virginia Woolf, and some nice green roses to represent Oscar Wilde. All represents individuality, finality, and pride in being "different". These works and people kept me alive through the years.



Thanks for listening. I don't post often, only when I feel really, really bad. This time I'm glad to be posting something good. :) 



EDIT: here's a proper look at the tattoo: https://i.imgur.com/sZwYDHT.jpg

Tonight I was at the park playing Pokémon Go. I had just gotten off of work and thought it would be relaxing to walk around and catch some mons before I went home. While I was there, I decided to roll up the sleeves on my sweater because I was overheating. Underneath is a 7" long vertical scar. Immediately afterward, I met a guy about four years younger than me. We talked a little bit and he started following me around the park. He seemed nice, so I had no problem with this. About ten minutes in, he made a joke about suicide. "No big deal", I thought, "he probably hasn't noticed my scar." As we continued, the jokes got more frequent. I began to get suspicious, but didn't want to be too reactant. After about an hour, we sat on a bench near two lured stops and he was making near constant sarcastic remarks about "killing himself" while intermittently looking at my scar and smirking. Two minutes later, his friend (new to me) sat down and joined in. I diffused the situation gracefully and got them to leave, but I went home and felt really low. All I was trying to do was enjoy some time out of the house and play my game and these idiots completely ruined my night. It was a huge trigger, but I've calmed down. Regardless, what would motivate a person to be so cruel when they are completely unprovoked?

June 24th is the day I had planned to kill myself. For months I have had this planned, down to the minute of the day. I had the gun in my hand and the note taped to the mirror, and I was ready to do this. I wasn't afraid, I wasn't anxious. I was ready. I was happy to be rid of this miserable disease we call life. 

It's funny how such a simple sentence can change your perspective on so much. 

"I can't do this without you."



June 24th is the day I threw away my razor blades. June 24th is the day I put down the gun and I burned the note I had so neatly written.



June 24th is the day my life begins.



EDIT: wow... Thank you guys so much for your support. And thanks for the gold! Love you guys <3

This is the kind of attitude I'm picking up from a lot of mental health workers. It doesn't matter if I'm in bed 24/7, as long as I don't hurt myself it's all good. 



The reality is, nobody really gives a shit about you (unless you have close friends and family, which I don't). The only reason they don't want you to do it is because you're worth more to the government alive and someone would have to clean you up. 



I hate life.

This is a depression subreddit. This is basically the home of long, sad, sometimes angry rants. This is where you're supposed to write that sort of thing and be understood. If you want to downvote sad things then go on a Sunshine Rainbow Sparkly Land subreddit where it's about being happy and not about being sad.



But here on /r/depression, you don't downvote sad things. Because everything here is sad. People are vulnerable here. Who knows, someone might see the downvotes and commit suicide because THAT is how much what people think of you matter to people here.



So next time you see something you don't like, THINK before you DOWNVOTE please. It hurts to see people hate on something very personal to you. It hurts to see people downvote a rant of pure emotion and loneliness. Recently, I wrote something from a VERY vulnerable mindset and it got multiple downvotes. It just kills me that not even an online DEPRESSION group is safe for people with depression.



It hurts me so, so much when I write something while crying alone in my room and it gets so many downvotes and nothing else, and it hurts when I see someone writing something, scared and alone, and it gets downvotes.



So please consider what people with depression are going through next time you see something you don't like.

I hold myself to impossible standards. I have no idea why; nobody in my life put the expectations on me that I've put on myself. This is coupled with a fierce fear of failure. I've realized that the result of this is me constantly holding myself back. I keep myself socially secluded, and never really put myself out there for anything, because when I do, and inevitably dont meet my own irrational standards, I turn into a useless void of self-pity. I make up excuses for why I don't do anything. I'm starting to think I'm just lazy. Or scared. Idk.

I got depressed about 2 years ago anI slowly drifted away from my friends. At the moment I only have one person I occasionaly talk to. The bad thing is that she is going to university in England next year (I live in the Netherlands). I will have nobody left and I recently started thinking of commiting suicide everyday.



But last week I had the idea to buy a pet to care for so I will have a small reason to live. And I absolutely love my new hamster.



I just wanted to tell how I feel right now and maybe getting a pet will help some of you guys. I got a hamster because they are pretty cheap and really easy to take care for, because I know it's hard to take care of something if you already have problems with taking care of yourself.



So that's all, I hope all of you have a great day today.

We have a carefree childhood that eventually transitions into us working to save enough money so we can retire at a reasonable age and somewhat enjoy our last years ...



What fulfillment is there in that? Am I the only one who feels like we are glorified robots living out our days to its meaningless ends? It's like a "system" that is in place for us very few people possess the resources to deviate from it's influence. I barely have the motivation to get out of bed anymore.

New years kinda gets to me emotionally. I worked until 11pm so I could distract myself for most of it but when I got home it all kinda hit me. I see all my friends have girlfriends/boyfriends with them, holding onto each other, looking into each others eyes full of anticipation for a new year. Then I see me, completely alone, just sitting in my house, contemplating "is 2016 gonna be the year I go through with it and OD"? Then it hit me even more...while my friends and colleagues were having a great time, I was just alone seriously contemplating killing myself.



Why do I have to be like this? I thought I actually had a tight grip on my depression, but NYE proved otherwise.

So these classes weren't for summer credit. However, the university has a mental health recovery program. I needed something to do this summer. My life was lacking structure and purpose. I signed up on a whim and gave mindfulness meditation class a chance. It was amazing being surrounded by supportive people. I finally feel hopeful about my circumstances. There's a glimmer of hope to turn things around.  I'm really thankful for having awesome professors and counselors.

perhaps the only thing keeping me from doing it in my darker times. Which is virtually all the time.



what have I done to deserve to feel this way. to be ostracised from the rest of the human race. I didn't ask to be born and I've been born to suffer.

The little victories really are the best. 



This is the feeling I have been working towards for so long. My motivation is slowly coming back.



 I'm beating this. 



EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the amazing supportive comments. 

This community is amazing and I am very lucky to be able to post in a sub where people understand and can give me the validation I need for completeing a task many people see a "simple".

It isn't. It's hard. It's climbing a mountain and crossing a desert. 

To everyone who has managed to do something 

today whether it was just get out of bed - well done.  You kick ass. 



We are beating this and we will all get there.

I.



When I feel depressed, I don’t want to hear about the newest vitamin that cured your depression. I don’t want to be reminded that exercise releases endorphins, or that I should go out and meet some people.



Believe me, I’ve already thought of this.



I don’t want to be pressured into going to your party because you just know it will help me. I don’t want to be called out during the party to dance like everyone else. I don’t want to drive twenty minutes to see you when just getting out of bed is like climbing a mountain.



I know you mean well, but it’s not just the thought that counts, it’s the effort too.



I don’t want to know that people have it worse than me. I don’t want to hear about the time you got divorced and your mom died in the same week, but here you are now, scarless and happy. If I could just stop and get over it, don’t you think I would have done that years ago?



My monster isn’t like yours. My monster stays when the reasons have gone away. It tells me that I’m worthless simply because I’m depressed. You want me to feel your empathy, but all I feel is isolation.



When I’m depressed, I’m a scared little child cowering in a corner. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t see a way out. The people moving around me fade into the background, like algae seen through a murky lake.



When I reach out of the fog and try to catch the hand of a passerby, I see in their eyes their thoughts about me. They are judging me. They have the answer where I don’t. They were able to get through it, but I am not. They know what it’s like because they’ve been sad before. They think what worked for them will work for me, and since it’s not their fault I feel this way, it’s my fault.



I’m already judging myself, so it’s natural to project that into other people. Now I am doubly judged. I judge myself and I see others judging me. I don’t belong here. I am not normal. I am not wanted. I’m not good enough. So I stop reaching out.



And you don’t get it. You think that because I don’t ever ask you to help me, that I don’t want your help. You get frustrated because you just can’t get through to me. You don’t understand why I can’t just accept your love. You want to know why? It’s because I don’t believe I deserve to be loved. And why should I? I don’t love myself.



II.



I don’t like anything about me. I HATE myself. It feels like something about me, about my core, is broken. I do not experience depression, I am depression. Something about the way I was put together is wrong. The common thing in my life is me, my depression, and I. Why couldn’t I have just -- said yes to the girl -- left when I knew it was over -- saved my money for bills? I hate that I make so many mistakes.



I hate myself, and I can’t see the way to get better. No one wants to help me, or if they do, they don’t understand me. They are uncomfortable around my depression. I make a joke about death. No one gets it. They haven’t been there. They see a menacing threat, an evil shadow where I see a warm embrace, soothing quiet, and certain peace. I’ve exhausted all my options; I’ve tried everything. I hate that I can’t fix myself.



But don’t believe for a second that I don’t want to live. I do. Those times that I stay at home, alone, in the dark, still in bed, skipping work, school, friends, promises; those are the days it takes everything in me just to stay alive. But I’m prolonging the life of someone I hate, and I resent that.



III.



What is it that I want when I’m like that? Locked up in my house, refusing calls? Letting Netflix play until I want to vomit all over my -- formerly -- favorite shows? What does someone who hates themselves, who sees themselves as broken and unfixable, what does that person need?



Honestly?



A hug.



I want someone to come over and hug me, and not let go. I want to feel like I’m not in your way, that you’d rather be nowhere else in the world than here with me, comforting me. I want to know that you would stay all day if that’s how long it takes.



I don’t want you to talk about yourself, I want you to be interested in me. I want you to ask questions about how it feels. I want you to look in my eyes with concern. I want you to smile at me simply because you’re pleased to see me. I want to know that you’ll spend as much time as it takes to understand exactly how I feel. I want you to talk quietly. I want you to enjoy some silence with me. 



I want to know that there is nothing I have to do in exchange for you doing this for me, that I don’t have to earn it. I need to know that you are complete without me, so there’s nothing I have to do for you unless I feel like it, and I want to know that you aren’t doing anything for me for any other reason than you feel like it.



Why do I want you to do this? It’s because I want you to show me that I am valuable, because I can’t believe the words anymore. I want you to work hard to understand me, because I can’t feel connections anymore. I need you to prove it to me with your actions, because the words lost their meaning to me. I do want you to tell me, over and over again, how it totally makes sense to you that I’m depressed, that you would be depressed too if you were me, that I don’t owe anyone my happiness. I want you to tell me that the people who say otherwise are dead wrong.



And you know what? Maybe once you’ve done this, I might listen to your advice about eating right and exercising. Maybe I can articulate why your suggestion wouldn’t work for me, and we can figure out something else, together. But I can’t open up to you until you show me you love me, because, remember, I hate myself, and it’s easier to believe you hate me too than to accept that you love me.



So before you ask if I’m seeing a counselor, ask me what kind of help has been effective for me. Before you try to solve my problems, listen to me telling you what my problems really are. Before suggesting I get out and see people, spend some time with me alone.



And maybe after you give me a long hug, I might want to go to your party.

"Depression does not always mean

Beautiful girls shattering at the wrists

A glorified, heroic battle for your sanity

Or mothers that never got the chance to say good-bye



Sometimes depression means

Not getting out of bed for three days

Because your feet refuse to believe

That they will not shatter upon impact with the floor



Sometimes depression means 

That summoning the willpower 

To go downstairs and do the laundry

Is the most impressive thing you accomplish that week



Sometimes depression means

Lying on the floor staring at the ceiling for hours

Because you cannot convince your body 

That it is capable of movement



Sometimes depression means

Not being able to write for weeks 

Because the only words you have to offer the world

Are trapped and drowning and I swear to God I’m trying



Sometimes depression means 

That every single bone in your body aches 

But you have to keep going through the motions

Because you are not allowed to call in to work depressed



Sometimes depression means

Ignoring every phone call for an entire month

Because yes, they have the right number

But you’re not the person they’re looking for, not anymore"

So I guess I view depression differently than it is defined and explained in textbook and definitions. I feel that I am depressed because I see the world for how it really is. I have no motivation to do anything and that is because I don't agree with how things in this society are done. I get up every day to go to a job that I don't like, to make money to pay for things that I wish I didn't need, and to have materialistic things that I really don't care for.



I do what society tells me I'm supposed to do. For the longest time I've been just 'going with the flow' because when I looked around I saw that's what everyone else was doing. I'm supposed to go to school, whether I like it or not, so that I can 'make a great life for myself'. My dad always said that after I work hard to get a job that will give me a comfortable life, I can just live for my weekends like he does. Well, I don't want to just live for my weekends like he does. I don't want this life that I am supposed to live and supposed to be grateful for. 



Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for a lot of my life. I have had the privilege of living a pretty comfortable life compared to a lot of people on this planet. I have a roof over my head, food in the fridge, electricity, heat, running water, the privilege to get a car when I got my drivers license, the privilege to work, Santa was always generous to me, and I have always had clothes on my back. I know that there are people on this planet that would kill for this life, and I am grateful that I have it. Then again, very saddened that I feel the way I do and saddened that other people don't have as much as I do. 



I'm just not happy. Grateful, but not happy. I'm not happy living by the rules and regulations that fuck knows who has set for me. I'm not happy that I don't get to admit to not being happy because other people have less. I'm not happy that other people have less. 



I'm recovering from opiate addiction. I feel that I turned to opiates because I wasn't getting enough out of this life, I guess it was an escape for me. Now that I am not high anymore, I don't want to be here anymore. If I can't find a way to escape or a different way to live, I don't want to be here. When I found an escape, it hurt other people. I don't want to hurt anyone, so I stopped. Now I'm the one being hurt. Why does someone always have to hurt? If it's not one person, it's the next. 



Now, when I look at people, I feel bad. I feel bad for my Dad who 'lives for his weekends'. What a sad life. He doesn't like his job, but he does it because it's what is expected of him. He works a lot, then he comes home, watches TV and goes to bed and then repeat. What kind of life is that? I don't understand why there are only certain people that are depressed. I don't understand how the entire world isn't depressed. I don't understand how people can be happy living life like this. I wish I could just be numb to it like my Dad seems to be. I just can't accept this. I don't want to live that life. I don't want to live this life. I don't know where to go from here.



I'm sorry if this is a jumbled mess. I'm at work, so I had to stop and start and stop and start. I wish I wasn't at work though. I just wish I was in my bed, which isn't even comfy to me anymore.



Edit: Wow! You are all so kind and amazingly understanding. There are a lot more people who think like me and as comforting that is, I'm sorry that some of you are going through what you're going through. I'm trying to reply to everyone, but I am working so it is taking me a while. The articles and links that some people have provided are actually more than helpful to me. I really haven't searched up much on me feeling like this so it is really eye opening to read everyones similar views and wise words.



Thank you all so much and I am going to continue reading all your posts. What would normally feel like a long, exhausting work day is actually turning into a not so long exhausting work day. It's actually going by pretty fast.



Edit #2: Words truly cannot describe how comforting this all is. I'm just getting back on here now. I live in Canada and it is the craziest snow storm outside right now so I just spent about 5 hours in traffic (normally a 30 minute drive). I'm going to continue reading everything now. Again, thank you all so much for your input. You have all really made my day! I love you all and if I could give you all hugs and high fives I would.

I could sleep 8 or 15 hours and still be tired. It's like I'm fighting off depression in the night, because I always feel ok when I wake up, but as the day goes on I leave the ability to pretend I'm ok and end up feeling like shit. Don't know if this is the case for anyone else.

I don't have anyone to tell, but I feel kind of accomplished. And like a disgusting loser at the same time. I showered, washed my hair, dried off with clean towels, and got dressed into clean clothes. I even put a goddamn bra on! 



It's been a really rough few weeks. I basically never leave my flat (apartment) anyway, but I haven't even been able to answer the door at all, even to family or like, delivery people. 



I know that people would read this and think, "Jesus H., I could never go *one* day without showering, that's gross!" But I wasn't always this unwell. I used to go to college and work, and I'd shower every day. I stopped working in 2004 and I've relied on disability benefits ever since. It's something of which I'm incredibly ashamed. I didn't become this repulsive, reclusive loser over night. It's been 10+ years of surviving day-to-day as best I can. Sometimes my best is well below par, and I don't eat, I sleep 12 hours a day, I don't see or speak to anyone, I don't wash properly. My dad is massively supportive and helps me any way he can (leaving bags of groceries by my front door etc.), but things like bathing and eating... only I can tackle those challenges.



tl;dr I did a normal daily life human thing. Yay?

**EDIT**: Wow, I'm completely blown away by how kind and thoughtful you've all been... reading all the messages this morning made me cry, I was so filled up with your positivity! Honestly, I was half expecting a few less-than-kind responses calling me a Josie Grossie(!), but I'm overwhelmed by how understanding and compassionate you all are.  It's heartbreaking that so many can identify with the self-care struggle, but... baby steps. No matter how small or trivial the achievement, a win is a win :) Sorry I haven't replied to everyone...

I got my Driver's license today.



It's surreal.



I've wanted this day to come for 9 years (I'm 25). Life circumstances and not having someone to teach me full-time put it off.



I began to get frustrated. When I was in undergrad, and everyone around me had a license and a car passed down to them or brought by a family member.



I had to rely on people to give me rides. I was always scared to ask and I was embarrassed. 



I once had to walk in the rain from my off campus apartment to get to class, and I was soaked to my shoes and got my rental textbooks wet.



I had to walk in the 90 degree sun to get to work one summer, and I would be sweaty and miserable and feel disgusting.



I could never just go to the store if I wanted to, or go experience things I wanted to do.



I suppose the only good thing was that I saved money, and that I was never a DD, because hell, I couldn't be.



It's been a rough few months. Having to relocate permanently to my mom's after being dumped. Not holding work for almost a year, my depression and anxiety getting hard to manage because I have no health insurance.



But now I finally have something. Once again, I'm not excited as I should be because I tell myself, "You should have had it by now." "You still don't have your own car." "Your face is fat in the picture."



I know my mom isn't going to let me driver her car whenever I want to. 



But it's a start. 



I wish I felt more proud of myself.

Most people here probably have an idea of how they can help themselves. We're just too depressed/apathetic to put those ideas into motion. Can anyone relate or know how to get the ball rolling in the first place?





Edit: Wow, had no idea this thread would resonate with so many people. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not alone and hearing your stories is giving me that little push to, you know, do something.

119 days ago I had to stop drinking. I would blackout every time I'd drink due to the excessive amounts I would have. I would wake up most mornings with a terrible hangover and cuts on my arms. I would later find out that my housemate caught me sniffing my medication mixed with pain killers. 



But today was the first time since I was a teenager that I cut myself whilst being sober. I watched the blood come out and be washed down the drain in the shower. My depression is genetic apparently as there are no known triggers. I am in my last year of my chemical engineering degree, I have an incredible family and friends and I see my psychiatrist and psychologist regularly, but for some unknown reason, I hate myself and feel so empty and alone. I wanted to share my afternoon with someone, without telling my friends, someone who knows how I'm feeling.

Not technically "suicidal" or anything. But sometimes my philosophy on it is if you're throwing your life away, you may as well do it in a spectacular way.



But I wish I wasnt so fucked up.

Like if your depression isn't a 10 on a scale from 1 to 10, then you must be a lazy asshole who's looking for excuses? I feel like this whenever my depression subsides a bit (especially since starting a new, effective medication) - I will read some posts here and start to think "I don't belong here. What am I doing here? These people are *actually* depressed. This person has attempted suicide several times. That person had a really rough childhood. That other person feels so bad that they can't get out of bed in the morning. And me? My life seems pretty okay compared to all of them. I just need to get my shit together and stop making excuses." ... followed by feelings of guilt and worthlessness.



Are these thoughts normal with depression?

I've been in a abusive relationship for to long! But today I ended it! She's been abusing me for so long and I finally grew the balls to tell her that I can't take it anymore.

 And you know what else I did? I CLEANED MY ROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2 YEARS. feels gooooood.

And I'm not going to spend this NYE alone! I'm going to spend it with my bestfriend. 

I'm happy! And I wish you all a happy new year. It will get better, but not by itself, you have to take control.

“Depression is humiliating. It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your children, your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything outside of bed. You alienate your friends because you can’t comport yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. If you and your loved ones have been spared, every blessing to you. If depression has taken root in you or your loved ones, every blessing to you, too. No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a dentist appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. Depression is real. Just because you’ve never had it doesn’t make it imaginary. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. Have a heart. Judge not lest ye be judged.”



Right in the few feels that are still there.

I hope that all of us get the appropriate help we need and someday turn our lives around, but let's be honest, today is probably not that day.



So may your bed be extra warm and your favorite re runs be on TV. I hope you get that unhealthily long sleep you want, and I hope your teachers and/or employers take it easy on you. I hope nobody makes it worse by telling you to "just be happy" or to take some vitamins for your depression. And I hope you don't feel too down on yourself.

On paper, my life isn't that bad at all compared to some people. I have a family, a job (not a good one but a job nonetheless), some friends (not as much as I hope to have but they're still good friends), never lost someone very close to me, live in a pretty good neighbourhood and in a wonderful country. I have no real reason to have depressed thoughts, yet I still feel like I wouldn't care if I stopped existing tomorrow. I have no SO or life goals or anything I'm really passionate about. When I think about my future, I see blank emptiness. I can't think of anything to live for.  



I always knew about this sub but never visited because I didn't think I was depressed. I'm still not sure if I am since I only have these thoughts sometimes when I'm lying in bed trying to fall asleep and then I just cry until I wake up the next morning. Most of the time though I just live day to day and try not to think about these things. But sometimes, like tonight, these thoughts creep in and I'm thinking of how pathetic and pointless my life has been so far. I just wish I can find something to live for so that I can work towards it.

Even though I'm surrounded by loving friends and family, I feel very empty inside. The worse end of the human condition. It doesn't subside unless I find something externally stimulating, but once that passes away, the loneliness and emptiness creeps in again. Any meaning that I've been able to derive out of social relationships don't hold much very for me now, because I've realized people don't actually give a shit. It is all so crippling and somedays I barely find motivation to do anything.

Since I've begun feeling like this I've shut myself away from everything I could. I didn't want to poison anyone else with these awful feelings and they all just assumed I was doing my own thing so these thoughts have been left unspoken until now. I don't even want help anymore I just want to die a death that I did not directly cause. Something like a car crash or an unfortunate construction accident, a freak flu that causes people to drop dead. I repeat just to emphasize, I don't want to kill myself, I just want to die.

"Yeah," 



I blink the tears away. 



"I'm fine."



I pull my sleeve down, hide the scars. 



"Just tired." 



I banish the thoughts away. 



"Why do you ask?"



I put the mask back on, and there it stays. 



I'm not doing so well this week, wanted to put it in writing.

I was on my way to a store to buy a keyboard (bec the one I use just broke) and I thought I could just end it there. I was about to dive in when a stranger pulled me by my shirt and I just started crying uncontrollably. I thought it wasn't obvious that I was about dive in front of the oncoming train. Then the guy gave me a hug while I was crying and snot dripping down my nose. I don't know whether to thank him or be angry at him, but I just told him that he should go bec I don't want him to miss the train. I'm filled with so much guilt rn and I can't tell anybody in my home about what happened today. 





Edit: I didn't think anybody would be able to read this. Thank you for all the kind words. I am doing a lot better now than I did earlier today. 



Edit2: I am overwhelmed by all the kind words from everybody (but I still have this feeling that I don't deserve any of it.) I just now realized how big of an inconvenience I would have been if nobody was there to pull me back. I didn't come back home until just now, and rn I just want a whole pot of tea and a good sleep. Again, thank you to everybody who read this

A while ago, I decided that I would "come out" and tell friends and family that I suffer from depression, in the hope that they would actually care and understand my situation. Believe me, it was better when they all was left out in the dark. 



So going from having a fairly "normal" relationship with my family and friends, I am now treated as the outcast that nobody wants to talk to. My wife is ready to leave me, mainly due to my depression and she makes no attempt to hide that this is the reason. My parents haven't really spoken to me the last year, they have the opinion that a depression is a "minor ting", and it's just to snap my fingers and change my attitude... So they basically won't bother talking to me until I "snap out of it", as they so elegantly put it. My sister just simply turned her back on me, but she is a genuine cunt anyway, so I am not really bothered by that. Good riddance. 



When it come to friends, I've always had very few real friends, and after I started telling people about this, I was quickly down to only one (just proving that the people I considered "real friends" wasn't so real after all). Unfortunately he unexpectedly died about 3 months ago, so now I am basically alone. 



After I started being honest and let down my false mask of pretend happiness, the people I thought was my friends, abandoned me. My family treats me like I am either "the village idiot", or like I have a contagious disease and thus dangerous to be around.... I think the only two humans who still actually love and care about me, is my two kids. I guess that will last until my wife and other family brainwash them into thinking the same way about me as they are...  



At least I had some "friends" and family before I stupidly opened my mouth, and sort of a social life. Now all of that is gone... 



I thought I was lonely before all of this. Now I know I was wrong. I found this definition in the dictionary earlier today:

Loneliness; standing apart; isolated. E.g "a lonely tower".



I guess that is what I am now... A lonely tower... 



Stay safe and survive. That is what I try to do every day.

Most days I just feel depressed and lethargic. (Not hopeless, just frustrated and generally annoyed by life)



Other days, I feel fine, but my life and complete lack of self esteem feel more to me like a joke than anything, and I have a horribly self-deprecating and morbid sense of humor. But I just can't imagine a version of me without a self destructive mindset.



I must have been pretty depressed for most of my life, because I just have this horrible mindset that makes feeling less depressed seem like abandoning myself :P



(Not to mention that I think this mindset is making medication useless)

I feel really strange. This is something I always wanted; I didn't really expect that.



So I was on my way home from school, which was really bad. I switched schools and most people seem to like me; at least when I'm pretending to be all happy and funny; but one person doesn't really like me and threatened me, because she wanted to sit where I usually sit. I almost broke down in tears.



After school I was waiting for my bus and a classmate called me; I was so anxious and confused since I never had anyone calling me for no reason. I was asked to wait for her at the bus station so we can drive home together; I had nothing to lose, so I decided to wait for her. Right in front of her house she opened her arms and I was all like "huh?"; she told me that she wanted to say goodbye and so we hugged.



I feel so strange and yet kind of happy; I don't know. I have no idea how I feel, but it was something that really brightened my day. I see all those sad posts on here and never posted something uplifting, but this is really an achievement for me that I wanted to share. 



Thanks for reading, I hope you don't mind me posting something positive and I hope that something like this will happen to you too. It doesn't cure me of depression or some sort; it just made me feel better for at least today.

Today, I successfully convinced my parents to let me see a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and am now taking antidepressants. 



I fucking did it. No matter how incessant that voice in my head telling me to go kill myself was, no matter how excited I felt as I picked up that kitchen knife, no matter how angry and shameful my parents were at me and no matter how great the hatred I had for myself...



...I successfully managed to embrace and endure it all. I chose the path that keeps me alive.



I know it's not over yet. The feeling is still there, of wanting to give everything up and end it all.



But fuck that shit. This is now my turnabout, and I'm far from going down.

I badly wanted to kill myself in the last few weeks. I even made arrangements. I wrote my last messages. I had prepared my goodbyes. I was set to go next Friday. 





Something struck me today. Yes, The girl I loved the most is no more. Yes, My career is a dead end. Yes, I'm fat and ugly. Yes, I might as well be dead. Yes, I may be clinically depressed. 



Despite all this, I realised might not have lost everything in my life. I did have Reddit to cling on to. I have snoo. I've been thinking and crying for the last few hours. and I'm crying as I type this. 



I want to put my life back together. I don't want my past to kill me. And so I'm making a promise.



Dear reddit, 



I will not let this decision fade away like last time. I will read this post every single day. I will relive every emotion I'm feeling now and put myself back on track every single day. I know you will always be there for me, even if nobody else will. You know what? Fuck them. I don't need anybody else. Only you can understand me. It's just you and me now. Let's do this shit. 









**Edit**: You people are so warm! Thank you for the overwhelming response. Really did not see this coming.



and to the redditor who "gilded"(whatever that does) this post: I really don't know how much you paid for this, kind stranger. What matters more to me is the fact that a person I don't even know, wants to encourage me in some way to get my life back on track. This post, this moment, is where I begin anew, friend. I will definitely not lose it from here. Thank you. Thank you so much. 



Will post an update in a week or two.

This may sound a little weird, but ever since i was young, i had periods when i was feeling really shitty. Now at that time i didnt really know what depression really was, and, since my life is okay, i had parents, siblings and friends that i know love me, but still i was often sad. I was never suicidal, its something i could never do, cause i know it would really hurt the ones i love. So i would have this, i guess you could say fantasies of my parents and my siblings dying in some accident or something.



 My logic was that if they died i would have a reason to feel this way. People would understand why i cant concentrate on school, or enjoy myself when i go out with friends. It was better option than me committing suicide, cause only i would suffer, not other people if i killed myself. This kind of thoughts would happen a lot, ans still do. I still feel like an ungrateful shit, cause they are people in situations way worse than mine. 



Right now im working up the courage to tell my parents about my depression and find a therapist. Every night i say to myslef that i'm gonna tell them tomorrow, but i never do, mostly because i know that they will think it's their fault, and i dont wanna make them feel bad.

For a while now, I have felt very lonely for myself. I had been gravitating away from friends and family, and I was planning on just kinda distancing myself from everyone. I felt like I got on everyone's nerves, that no one really wanted to see me at all, and the only reason for people talking to me was because they were too nice to just move on. I hate my life as it is, I have no direction for which to follow, and I will probably die alone. Today was a breath of fresh air! I had a combined lunch after all of my classes, where everyone was, and due to the school band schedule, my usual group was nowhere to be found. I had kinda talked to one of my friend's friends every once in a while, but nothing long or lasting. She is one of the sweetest and outgoing people I have ever witnessed. She had approached me, asking me about what my favorite anime or show was (I am a tall, skinny, creepy looking otaku) and I was caught a little off guard at first. This conversation went on for the length of lunch, and I was starting to go on my own to reach the bus to go home, and she grabbed my arm, and asked me where I was going. When I had told her, she told me: "Well, so am I!!!", and once we walked together to the point where we would separate, she stopped me, and asked me for a hug. I happily accepted it! I could hear the people behind me going: "He's got a girlfriend?!", just like everyone else would say. I didn't fucking care what people thought at that moment. I got on the bus, sat by myself, and I thought about what just happened. I had a smile on my face, probably broke something to make a smile! She had given me the time and the attention that I needed after a long day of exams. So, people of reddit: Please, you guys and gals, don't give up hope! I know you people are all going to be fine if you give it a bit of time! Thank you for your time, and remember, if you smile, or talk to someone who needs it, I promise you, it will make their lives!

EDIT: To everyone that upvoted, or commented, thank you a lot! It is awesome to know you guys care!

EDIT EDIT: You guys just hit 100 upvotes...I cant believe how thoughtful you people are! I am so happy!!!

Warning: I will sound like an entitled child, but I'm dead serious about this.



I'm currently a student and recently I've quit my part time office job. The job should've been great, decent hourly pay, major-related, alright coworkers, etc. but it's only made me feel suicidal. 



You wake up way too early just to prepare to go to work, you waste more of your life with the commute, you slave away for 8+ hours, commute back, do 'chores' and you get to have 2 hours of rest. Yay! Obviously those 2 hours are filled with dread of waking up tomorrow again, but you know, relax for those 120 minutes. Enjoy "life"!



Now this job was 2 days a week. Simply imagining doing this for 5 fucking days a week for decades is making me suicidal. There's no work-life balance. Maybe 2 hours a day of actual free time. Work is your life. If you have family, you'll see your coworkers more than your family. You're a slave. Fuck this.



I will graduate in like 2 years. University is alright. Don't get me wrong, I still stuffer from depression, but it's okay. I have my own schedule. I can take breaks or take a day off for my mental health. I'm surviving without suicidal thoughts. 



Maybe I'll add a PhD if my mom won't be dead by then, because she's the only reason I'm currently doubting my plans. Otherwise, that will have been it. 





Again, I know how it sounds. "Welcome to the real world" ; "That's being an adult". I'm fully aware there's no way around to still survive, so the only logical way out is suicide. Fuck the real world. Fuck being an adult. I will have had my 23ish years of being free, I'll thank my family a lot for making it at least bearable for that time.





P.S.: Those who do have jobs, how are you still alive? What's wrong with you? How is not everyone doing this BS suicidal?

For example I'm always convinced everyone hates me and that no one would care if I committed suicide. But every once in awhile I can stand back and look at myself more objectively. I realize I must come off as a huge loser for always saying that everyone against me and no one likes me when in reality I'm sure some people do. 



The irony is that I think I'm an loser because everyone hates me. But in reality I'm a loser because not everyone hates me and I can't accept it. You'd think I'd be happy if someone says they enjoy being with me. Instead I just tell them to fuck off.



I guess either way I'm a loser so it doesn't really make a difference.

I found it on amazon and bought it impulsively. If you don't happen to watch Rick and Morty, a meeseeks is basically an instant genie that grants your wish and then disappears. But if a meeseeks can't complete its mission with a day or two, it starts to break down and malfunction. They say "existence is pain for a meeseeks" and if they're around too long, things get weird. 



Sometimes I look at that meeseeks doll and remember how it wanted so badly to disappear but it couldn't because it still had a mission to complete. And I relate to that in a way because even though I have those episodes of depression where I wish I could just disappear, I know I can't. I haven't finished my mission on this earth yet. So I can't leave until it's the right time. 



Sorry for the rambling. Just hope some of you can relate, even if it is just a cartoon.

For my university's spring break I decided to go on a backpacking trip with 10 strangers through one of our adventure programs.



 I am so introverted. I am depressed most of the time, but I did it out of impulse. The first 3 days I hated it. People were so happy, all the time. People sang Disney songs every morning. I hated it so much. I isolated myself to my tent. I cried. I wanted to die. I thought about disappearing into the woods and never returning. 



On day four I became used to the unfamiliar environment and the unfamiliar people. I don't know what it was, maybe getting exercise and being outside nonstop every single day helped me, but I started to feel better. I was able to come out of my shell a little bit. My sense of humor started to show up, and people actually laughed at me. People listened to what I had to say. I felt valued for the first time in a long while.



As the week went on, I found myself unafraid to approach others and strike up conversations with other people in my group.  I really started to enjoy myself. The scenery was beautiful and each mile we hiked, I feel I learned a little more about myself and felt just a little bit better.



Towards the end of the trip, everyone decided on animals that represented each person in the group.  They determined I was a Giant Swallowtail (a type of butterfly) because I transformed so much in that week.



Now that the trip is over, I miss it so much. But, I just feel a little better overall. I came away with some confidence and new friends, and I just feel good about myself.  I am so glad I decided to sign up for that trip. I am really glad I pushed myself to do something I wasn't comfortable with at all.

I've been doodling sad comics recently which have helped me feel better. [I made this tonight.](http://imgur.com/gallery/JRdPqyg?lr=1455685837) I'd like to make a bigger one someday when I'm better at making flowcharts so let me know what I could add.



Edit: I'm still bad at making them but I'm going to post the sad comics weekly on [my blog](http://www.inbreak.ca/stckmen/)

I rarely talk in any of my classes except when I'm called on or during a group project, but a girl I was in a group with last week said hi and smiled as she walked past. It feels nice to be acknowledged.

The worst part is we wait for tomorrow in the hope that it will be better than today, but when tomorrow comes we just spend it wishing it were yesterday. It just feels like i'm simply waiting to die.   DAE feel this way?

Maybe I'll get mugged and it'll go wrong. Maybe a car will run a red light. Maybe somebody will show up with a gun on campus. 



I don't want to kill myself because I don't want my parents to think I killed myself or that I have depression, but I wish I would end.

I got out of bed at 6:30 AM this morning and made myself a healthy breakfast, drank some coffee, and took my vitamins. 



You're not going to trick me into skipping class to lie in bed all day, depression.



I'm also going to work out after class, and then tack on an extra 5K run for good measure. Endorphins are your kryptonite. And tomorrow I will not lie in bed all day, no matter how sore I am from working out. 



*Today's going to be good, and I'm not going to let depression fuck it up for me.*



**Edit: Yay - reddit gold! Thank you to whoever sent me that!!**



**Edit 2: I had no idea this would inspire people so much! Glad to see that I'm managing to bring some hope and smiles to the people of r/depression. :)**

My two closest friends ignore my messages all day.  

Forget to reply.  

Read, no reply.  

Never message me spontaneously.  

They know about my anxiety/depression.     

They know I just stopped seeing my psych because he was a dickhead.  

But can't even get a reply to a message.

No one cares! About me.

Almost cried in front of all my co-workers. It was the first time in a very long time that I actually felt worthy or even remotely good enough. It felt amazing to know that at least one person on the planet appreciates the effort I put in.



For most of my life I've always been the black sheep of my family. My whole family is ashamed of me to the point where I moved out to a tiny room in a nearby college campus where I struggle to pay the $500/mthly rent. I'm absolutely alone 99% of the time. I had one friend that I could count on to hang out with at least twice a month but he found himself a girlfriend and a new circle of friend so he's long gone. 



All I do is stay in my room and read about technology which is my only passion. I experiment with different gadgets and stuff on a daily basis just to keep me sane. My dream is to start a tech company but every time I look in the mirror I realize how far fetched that goal really is.



Anyway, enough with my ranting. Just wanted to share with you guys that I felt happy for the first time in a very long time. It was a great feeling even though it only lasted a few minutes. It also gave me hope that things might get better in the future and that one day I will be able to fall in love and just be happy.

[Finally got my GED](http://i.imgur.com/FxOJ0cp.jpg)



I dropped out of school when I was 17 and have been lost doing dead end jobs since then. I'm 25 now and have been trying to finish my GED for years but would constantly give up or just figured I'd never get it anyway. But finally. I got it. I told my depression to fuck off. That I was going to do this. And I did.



Just believe in yourself guys. This might be a small nothing to most. But to me this is the proudest thing I have ever done.

The problems weren't temporary. The exact same problems haunt me today, though they may be in slightly different forms. I have a host of new, much more crushing problems to add to them. 



But mostly, things definitely have not gotten better. If I could go back and choose to die 20 years ago, I would. It was definitely not worth being alive. And things continue to decline. 



Fuck this shit, and fuck all the "helpful" people out there telling lies so they can live on in denial of the fact that life is shit for a lot of people and pretty much just gets worse as time goes by.

I've been going through a rough patch recently, having struggled with severe bouts of depression for the past 10 years. I haven't been the person I want to be- I just want to be happy and less complicated but sometimes it is hard. I finally opened up to my boyfriend since I felt my sadness had taken a toll on our relationship. I told him that I know I have no reason to be sad, that I live in a nice area of the world and realize how lucky I am in many ways.



He told me he sent me a book that would make me feel better- I get the book and it is a story about a family who is killed in a concentration camp during World War Two. I was really confused, at first I honestly thought it was a mistake that he sent it. I asked what his intentions were and he told me that he was coming from a good place, and wanted me to realize how good I have it. I told him that I understand that his intentions were good, but that I felt his selection was a little off base. Just because I am depressed doesn't mean I am not thankful for my life and that I am ignorant to the plight of others. He told me that I was negative and that he was sick of me. We are no longer together. Trying to reconcile this right now. Feeling like a horrible person but knowing I had a reason to feel the way I felt about what happened.

***Being alone or feeling alone is horrible***



The worst part about depression can be the sheer loneliness, and the inability to express it. Feeling depressed makes people want to be alone (but not lonely) when they really shouldn't be. If you care, please check on your depressed loved-ones, often. Offering to simply hangout means so much.



Insulting, acting negatively or being in denial towards depressed people makes them feel even more isolated and unloved from you and in turn they won't trust you, or anyone else. If you are someone they look up to or consider close to you then you are a huge factor into them feeling better or worse.



Just saying "you'll be there" is not enough. It's a nice sentiment but you have to mean it and put it into practice, approach them even at times. So many have said they'll be there for me but simply haven't.



***You can't just "be happy", "get over it" or "snap out of it"***



Most people who suffer from depression have had someone say these things to them at some point in time. But it doesn't work like that. Don't you think that I would have "gotten over it" a long time ago if I could?



And it is unfair to expect a person to undo depression by merely thinking happy thoughts, while the human brain is incredible and a person can be mindful of forming new neural passageways, you can’t change a lamp into an elephant overnight, just as you can’t un-think a tumor from happening. It takes time.



Depression can last for long periods of time, even when a person wishes more than anything to wake up and be over it one morning. It’s a process, and one that looks different for everyone. Some people go running, others meet new people or take up a new hobby in effort to help themselves. The one method guaranteed to fail is telling a depressed person to “snap out of it.”



***People with depression are not attention seekers***



There are exceptions to nearly every rule, but the vast majority of people with depression are most certainly not attention seekers. If they were, then why are they not famous for saying "I'm fine" when they feel miserable? Why do they go to extreme lengths to hide their cuts if they self-harm? And why does suicide usually come as such a shock? The truth is that most people with depression hide their pain, often out of fear of being judged or discriminated against.



***Depression has little to do with life's circumstances***



Just because a person suffers from depression, it doesn't mean that they're a negative or an ungrateful person. Depression is an illness, and it can happen to anyone, positive and grateful people included.



Sometimes we can feel like we don’t have the right to be depressed because no great tragedy has occurred to us. But that’s not always how depression works. Sometimes it can be the direct result of a life event, but most times a chemical imbalance in the brain or an unresolved emotional issue sits at the core. Depression does not discriminate. It happens to the best of us.



***Anyone can fall victim to depression***



Depression is one of those illnesses that doesn't discriminate. No matter how much money you make or what gender, age, sexuality, colour or creed you are, you're at risk of falling victim.



***It's a real illness***



Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Just because it's an invisible illness, it doesn't mean that it isn't real. Frankly it's an immensely overlooked and under-cared for illness that has destructive effects on all aspects of life.



***One "good" day doesn't cure depression***



People with depression can have "good" days where they don't feel depressed, they can have days where they even feel happy. But it's a mistake to assume that just because they feel good one day, that they're no longer sick and therefore should feel good every day.



***There is no one universal cure***



I wish people knew that medications isn't the only solution or a solution for everyone. Millions of people don’t respond to medications. It can have side effects and make depression worse in some aspects.



There are many different solutions to come together that can help cure or dissipate depression. Such as: Medication, therapy, meditation, mindfulness, time, personal-growth, friends/family, greater purpose, exercise and diet. There is hope and huge chance for many to get better. Money and things don't cure depression.



***It's difficult, spontaneous and scary***



I wish people knew that the hardest thing some persons will ever do in this lifetime is to stay alive, that just because staying alive comes easily to some, it doesn’t mean arriving at a natural death is any less of a triumph for those who have to work so very hard to keep breathing every day.



I wish people knew that sometimes depression is triggered by something and sometimes it’s not, that sometimes one small thing is needed to pull a person out of darkness, and sometimes everything is unable to, that sometimes the only thing you can do is to wait for symptoms to subside.

It has had a profound effect on a lot of people, myself included. :)



If you feel up to it, I'd love for you to comment with:



Your name (or user name) / Your age / Where you're from / What you struggle with / And the best part: a link to a recent pic of yourself. 



Never mind the quality or size of the pic, I just want to see my fellow humans 💙 it's a whole lot more fun and special when more people comment! 



If this isn't ok please feel free to delete, and of course don't share anything you aren't comfortable with. 



Peace xo



EDIT: Ohh, man... You're all such amazing, glorious people. 

I will happily admit I get really emotional reading through all of the comments and replies here... A very confusing emotional; deep sadness for the collective pain that we are all experiencing, but also a real warmth, and.. sense of connection? 

Seeing everyone commenting on each other's posts, offering advice or sympathy or empathy or just plain old love... It wasn't the point of the post. It wasn't a requirement. It happened naturally, and it's beautiful. 

I don't swear, but you're all fucking beautiful.

Came up with this a few years ago. 



**Step 1**: Take shower in the dark, water at comfortable warmth. Try to get the room as dark as you can.



**Step 2**: Whenever you feel like it, sit down in the shower, water running on your head. Close your eyes and cover/plug your ears.



**Step 3**: Imagine as hard as you can that you are not in your shower. Place yourself into the following story, and fill in as many details as you care to.



"You are stranded alone on a lifeless planet in which it never stops raining. During the day, the rains are quite warm. But at night, they become frigid. You are trapped outside your one person spaceship and are sitting alone on a hill, overlooking the barren, grey wasteland without your spacesuit on. You can breathe here, but soon the water will be so cold you'll be killed by it instantly. This is the end for you, and you know it. You refuse to panic, though. Instead, you will think about your life." 



**Step 4**: Every once and a while, reach over and lower the temperature to your shower. Ponder the lonesomeness you feel in this rainy world that you'll never escape. If you feel like thinking about what is in your own life, feel free, but don't let it take over the main story, the icy and frozen planet.



**Step 5**: Once you get to a point of near uncomfortable coldness, wait a minute, then bring the temp down nearly as low as you can on your nozzle. Try to endure it for 10 seconds. Don't be afraid to let your body feel some of the shock from the cold. (But of course, don't do this to harm/punish yourself for anything.) 

Quickly turn the heat back up, take a moment or so, turn the shower off, and get out. Dry off. Lay in bed or just find a way to get warm and comfy again. 



Now the person trapped on the icy and dead planet is gone, they've died. But you, the *real* you is still here. You have escaped that awful place, and are ready to move on and face the next challenge in your life, and you can do it. Because this is the real world, and that icy, cold, hopeless planet exists almost entirely your own mind.



The exercise, the way I see it, helps us to recall that depression, while influenced by outside events and problems, is mostly internal. I do it every once in a while when I'm really low, and I've felt like it's a great way to end a terrible day with a bit of hope. Have a good week, everyone :)

This kind of depressing thought came to me today and I can't shake it off. I'm in grad school and at this point completely financially supported by my parents (living independently though) but I don't have motivation to do basic things like cooking and cleaning (I eat out or make premade dinners. My room's pretty gross, not hoarder levels of gross, like I throw out food containers and whatnot, just laundry and clutter everywhere. I'm embaressed whenever I accidently leave the door open.) My sleep habits and diet are terrible, and I barely have the motivation to get out of bed some days. I skip lab/class usually once a week. I know all the things that are messed up in my life, but don't have the motivation for some relatively simple fixes either, or I get bursts of motivation where I do the things I'm responsible for (and pretty damn well IMO) but I can't keep it up for more than a week at most before regressing into missing more school.



I was thinking, if my parents wouldn't/couldn't support me, I'd have to get a 9-5 job that I'd need to consistantly be at every day. If I can't manage having the energy to go to school every day, which is considerably less intensive than work (and not necessarily 8 hours) how will I keep a steady job which is so much more exerting? If I can't keep a job, and I don't have motivation to improve the small easy things in my life, how am I going to cope when I have no money, and then no place to live? I honestly think the only motivation that would keep me off the streets is my fixation on playing video games...



I really am scared for the day my parents give up on me and I truly need to face myself, alone.

Just posting this here because maybe you all can relate. I feel like when I finally get someone offering me the support that I crave that I just need to run away. It's frustrating for me and for them. But, hey, I drew something for the first time in like a decade so here ya go:

I thought it would suck and had anxiety about it the whole day especially because I had two tickets but no one wanted to go with me, but I actually had an AMAZING time. It was a Sufjan Stevens concert who is my favorite artist ever so I really got to absorb his music live without being distracted by anyone else, it was a really personal and cathartic experience. 



The only thing that kinda affected me was seeing all the friend groups and couples around me, it made me lust and miss someone, but otherwise I am glad that I went even if it was alone.

I don't know how to act so people will be happy with me unless I bury it all. I have depression, PTSD, and EDNOS as a result of sexual trauma as a teenager along with ADHD that I was born with but I've come to realize that the only support group I've got and will ever have is myself and only myself. I do not consider my therapist or psychiatrist to be part of any support group, considering they're only around as long as you pay them.



Does anyone else feel the same?

My off-and-on depression has been building up gradually over the past couple months, the fog rolling in thicker and thicker-- and today I woke up feeling like it hit its peak. It took all the energy I had just to get out of bed and go to work. I ended up being over 2 hours late. I had to cancel plans with a friend who I've already canceled/flaked on several times this month because I just did NOT have the energy. He said he understands, but the feelings of guilt/shame about canceling were so intense. 



My addict mind was telling me all day that I was gonna pick up a bottle of whiskey on the way home. It's funny how your brain can convince you that alcohol (or your vice of choice) is the ONLY thing that can make your pain, guilt, shame, self-loathing etc go away. But in reality, drinking myself to oblivion would make my situation WORSE. I would've woken up hungover and ashamed and still depressed as fuck tomorrow, and probably canceled again on my friend. Now I'll hopefully get a normal nights rest and wake up feeling semi-OK.



But here's some good things that happened today, I want to acknowledge them too. I went to an amazing doughnut shop and since they were about to close he sold me a whole box for $3. I passed the ones I didn't eat on to the homeless. And, feeling REALLY good about my choice to NOT get drunk tonight, feeling strong because I resisted such a strong urge, I was motivated to apply for health insurance, finally! Today was not a total loss for me. But it would've been if I had gotten drunk. I would've fed the voice of depression that tells me I'm worthless.



I really just wanted somewhere to share. I hope we all continue to get better.

Little by little it takes over and you don't even realise.





Mojo, joie de vivre, raison d'etre. Gone. With no explanation. Nothing satisfactory anyway.





First you stop enjoying time with friends as much. It feels empty. It's draining and distracting from that niggling urge to do nothing.



Then it's the lack of ambition in your job. You'll do as little as possible and leave as early as possible while still being under the radar. You get quite good at being mediocre. But you remember when it mattered to you. Just a memory you brush aside.



Then the things you used to find interesting don't hold that spark anymore. Read a book? Nah. Paint some art? Nah. Write... you used to love writing? Nah. Reddit? Yeah. Netflix? Yeah. Until I fall asleep.



And you sleep way more. You just want to be in bed, alone. You're annoyed you have to leave the house to go to work. You get headaches and withdraw more.



Then even the things you used to be able to force yourself to do become too much effort. Cleaning your home gets put on the long finger so much, you end up living in near squalor. Your pillow case is yellow and there are old McDonald's packaging all over your window sill.



You start to think your friends are against you, that they don't care about you. You have done so much for them, listened to their problems, left them alone when they wanted to be left alone, went to the end of the earth to help them out in their time of need. But where are they for you? How could they do this to you? How can they turn their backs?! Everyone is obsessed with their own problems in life. And now it seems, you're obsessed with yours. You feel guilty.



Anger gives way to apathy. You cut them off. They can't hurt you if you don't care about them.



You think you're ok though. You still laugh at jokes and genuinely find them funny. You can have great conversations with people. You can really enjoy a game you're playing or tv series you've become engaged in. You can sometimes feel good even if it's brief, manic even.



Sure, you ignore the occasional thoughts of suicide. Push them away. It's only attractive not because you feel sad, but because it just seems like a better option than the years of loneliness and boredom stretched out before you.



Then you have a small spark of motivation. Today is the day you'll clean up the house. Nope. It wasn't. But it could have been.



Today is the day you go to the gym. You've only put on a little bit of weight, it wouldn't take much to become hot again. Cos you were hot. But now guys just look past you. You've gotten older and chubbier and you feel the rejection deep. So you stop caring about dating. Today was not the day you went to the gym because no matter what you look like, no one is ever going to love you. They didn't when you were hot. Why would they now? So why deny yourself some tasty food, it's not like there's anything else in life you've got going for you? And another package ends up on the windowsill with it's other rotten fried friends.



Today is the day you enlist in that course you always said you'd do. Do better in work. But then you think with all the stress you're under you can't handle more stress. So you don't bother.



Even the tiniest problems seem like insurmountable tasks and it quells the spark of motivation every God damn time.



You need help. But you can't ask for it. Last time a friend was depressed she started acting really bitter and paranoid and was always crying on nights out, bringing everyone down, spreading negativity. People stopped inviting her out and eventually she faded into memory. It's better to lie. Better to wear the mask of happiness. But you know it's a mask and it's a lead mask.



You can't go to a doctor, it's too embarrassing, too shameful, too scary and too skeptical of medication.



You research online and find that eating right and exercising can do wonders. But when you resolve to do better, you do worse. You sabotage yourself and you don't even understand why. Then you hate yourself. You're disgusting, why would anyone be there for you? How can you expect to get anything good out of life when you're a piece of crap?



You cry, you sob, you break down wailing at the light-hearted end of Raising Arizona when it shows them old with all their children coming to visit. You don't get to have that. You're just going to die alone. 



Everyone has moved on in life except you. And no one seems to care.

It's up to you now. When was the last time you felt happy? Were you ever?



I am the only person standing in the way of myself. I'm the only one I'm fighting. And I'm winning. I'm losing.

Even though I woke up and knew it would be bad day. All the sweetest day things on social media and in stores today and I still got something done even though it's so small.



EDIT: God damn guys. I really expected a completely different response. You guys rock. Thanks for the support and understanding. I love you all no matter what you all may think of yourselves.

I don't want to kill myself because I don't think I can. I make plans every day and I just chicken out, thinking stuff like I'll only end up injuring or damaging myself further and making everything more miserable



But am I alone in wishing for things like getting run over, getting caught in a gunfight, or just peacefully drifting off and dying?



I always feel like I'm so alone, and I'm such a failure, like there's nothing to look forward to and as life goes on it will only go downhill. I'm so uncomfortable. This is a new one actually. I can't explain it. I'm just so unhappy in my skin, there's something bothering me so much all of a sudden and I wish I could jump out of my body to get away from this discomfort



I don't even know why I'm posting here, I wasn't diagnosed with depression. But I was diagnosed with anxiety a year ago or so



Edit - Gosh, thank you all so much for your incredible response! I wasn't too sure what to expect, but it was great hearing so much from all of you. i feel like maybe i'm not alone in feeling weird things. I'll respond to anybody i missed tomorrow after resting a little, it's bedtime for me... until then!

Feeling a bit down at denny's.  The waitress comes around and i make some kind of joke.  She lightly touches my arm playfully because it was funny and it was just basic human interaction.  Sometimes I forget how nice it is to be touched.

I always talk myself out of it with something along the lines of:



"Why should I call and complain about [X] when so many other people have things much *much* worse than I do? Honestly, what do I really have to be sad about?"

I find myself doing it a lot, admittedly a lot of times it's romance and sex but other times it's just imagining normal human interactions. It gets especially bad when I read an event in a book or watch one in a movie and start daydreaming about myself doing something in those situations. 



The worst is when I fantasize about some upcoming thing, like recently attending a college class for the first time, and having a perfect image of how it's going to go. Then I actually go and all my hyped up expectations are shattered.

I was reading through that guy's thread about how stuff doesn't just get better, and a lot of the comments were along the lines of "30 years? Damn you're tough"



I don't need to get into the details of my emotions, grievances or ailments, you guys have already been around the block as well. And we all have to face this horrifying bullshit 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I've been depressed for years, been through psychotic depression for months, cutting, drinking, the whole nine yards. Md now It's as if I'm numb to it. My emotions aren't fragile, because they're all shattered and fucked up as is. Not confused, or scared, it just is. 



You people are the only ones who understand the pain. How much mental strength and ability it takes to keep yourself alive. It's a fight with death every day. And if I ever tell anyone, sure, they can understand my pain, to an extent. But they don't know the strength of my mind either. Kinda like war, you don't understand it until you've been there. 



I remember my friend and I had a bad shrooms trip (separate occasions, however). He was on a lighter dose, but ended up having deep thoughts that equated to our good ole friend depression. That lasted all of fifteen minutes, and he told me it was the saddest, scariest, worst state of mind he had ever been in. From what he described to me, that was just my daily life. On a separate occasion I had a bad trip as well, my friend said that it was possibly the worst he'd ever seen anyone. After I came down and was all together again, all I could think was "Bad trip? That's some pussy shit." My four hours of anxiety and confusion, all while naked and crying on the bathroom floor, was like just reliving a normal night during my psychosis stage. 



It's almost as if I've already had so many horrifying, painful, and terrifying thoughts and emotions that random bullshit just doesn't even phase me anymore. Sadness. It's just a part of my life. I've had to tell a friend before "If I haven't offed myself yet, this [insert bad emotions attack] shit ain't gonna kill me."



So to all those out there still kickin', everyone who's been dealing with this shit for years, and for everyone who can see through the wishful thinking of "it gets better!"- Y'all some tough motherfuckers. The power to drag ourselves through life, devoid of hope, purpose, joy or reason- is highly underrated.

I have no confidence and whenever times have seemed to get better I spiral downwards 



But I don't want to kill myself for one reason only and that is because I don't want to ruin my family's life

They'll call or text to check up on you every once in a while. Ask to get together when possible. People you thought were friends but really aren't don't bother getting in touch with you once they find out your depressed. It's like the uncomfortableness of the subject is stronger than your friendship to them.



This has been my experience anyway.

A few months ago, we blacklisted the site and domain due to high-volume, persistent comment-spamming in the sub.



Since then, we've received dozens of complaints about this person sending imitation "personal" PMs to many of the OPs here in /r/depression, using a variety of different alt accounts, a variety of different first names, but only minor variations on the same boilerplate text which includes fake-personal comments like "sorry to bother you, please ignore if you're not interested". That wears a bit thin when people get these PMs by the handful.



As far as we've been able to determine, the subreddit appears to be a one-person/many-alt-account operation and it exists solely to circumvent reddit's spam-detection logic and drive traffic to the site. Please don't visit the site or the subreddit, and please report all PMs promoting either  the Catharticsite subreddit or cathartic.co as spam.



We hate to take up one of our sticky-post slots for something like this, but this unscrupulous and inconsiderate person has left us no other choice.

I know this sounds like a really stupid thing to be proud about, but I NEVER do my homework. I usually come home, sleep, and then feel terrible the next morning. I got home and rested and then actually got my ass up and did all my homework. I know this is a tiny feat but it gives me hope that slowly I can get better.



**EDIT**: thank you everyone for your encouragement and support. I can't even describe how much it means to me :)

Like for about half an hour, you'll just randomly feel really happy and you try to hold on to it but it just dissipates and you're left with your emotionless husk again. 





Like for fucks sake I was singing in the shower while using the showerhead as a mic. I was enjoying myself that much and now I have to wait till my brain lets me experience that again.

I don't know what to write, this has been in my head for the past two days and it's killing me. Please, listen to me.



It was my mum's birthday. I was intent on killing myself, I was miserable and reluctant. I called my dad. I cried, told him I can't do anything anymore. He yelled at me, told me I was an attention seeker and that I try to make everything about myself, my mum said the same thing. I screamed, cried and picked up a knife. I eventually put it down because I didn't want to die. I just wanted to be loved, you see. I'm 14 and barely have any friends. I was left silent in their house for an hour. Nobody came. My siblings knew I was suicidal because they were told. I'm the youngest of them all.



My uncle accused me of being a drug-addict when I've barely talked to him in my life. I've never even taken drugs or alcohol (he accused me of doing that, too). I didn't act erratically, infact all I did do was cry. I feel like I'm going crazy. Please help me.. I know it sounds like there are parts I'm not telling you but I really am telling you all of it. I've been hospitalised once in my life and I didn't even tell my friends. 



I've been having trouble doing anything lately. I haven't been doing my washing, or making my food. If someone else doesn't do it for me then I don't eat at all because I feel too sad. They're kicking me out of the house and I don't know when I'll come back. 



I don't know how to conclude this other than I've known all this for pretty much the past two days. I feel so angry but I was fine before. It's killing me the more time goes by. please help.



edit: before all of this my parents called me names. they made fun of my weight & the fact i'm a girl. i've been called all the derogatory names you could think of. my parents have told me they wish i was aborted, that i caused World War Two, i'm a failure etc. i don't think i'll ever forget all the things that have happened to me but i wish i could.

I've been waiting to see this certain psychiatrist for months. It's hard to get in to see him, so I've been seeing a counselor as well. This morning was my first appointment with the actual psychiatrist. I've seen a few before, so I knew what to expect: a bunch of questions trying to find the "root" cause of my depression, social anxiety, self harm issues, agoraphobia, panic disorder, etc. 



It started off pretty normal. I was nervous as hell (I don't like speaking to people in person) but the first few minutes were average. Nice to meet you, what brings you here, what can I do to help?



When I stated that I was there to try to overcome my depression/panic/anxiety issues, he was very sarcastic and was frankly being a smartass with his reply: "That's what everyone says to get drugs." What. The. Hell. He laughed after he said it, but it was really offensive in the context.



Next, he asked what I believe caused my anxiety. I started talking about the issues I had when I was younger, talking to people and whatnot, how being around people makes me nervous and panicky and how simple tasks freak me out- he interrupted me *again*, mid-sentence, and said - "Young girls like you (I'm 20) always say that you're anxious and nervous just to get out of doing stuff you don't want to do." *What?*



Next, he asked what caused my depression. I told him, very frankly and fast -since he likes to interrupt- that my parents divorce when I was younger royally fucked me over and just after that, I was raped. 



His response was - "Pretty young girls like you continuously blame other people for your depression. You all like to party, do drugs, get drunk, sleep around, and in the end say you're depressed. Some girls like you need to take a good look in the mirror and realize what the problem is. Maybe if you stopped sleeping around and partying, your life will be easier and this 'depression' (*yes, he really took his fingers making the quote expression*) would go away."



This isn't verbatim, of course, at that point I was mid panic attack - but that is the gist of it. I'm still in total shock. I don't sleep around/party, I barely even walk outside of my house. I didn't even mention it before that, nor did he. It just spat out of his mouth. The second he said that, I walked out. I didn't even stop at the reception desk in the front. I'm at a total loss. 



People who are supposed to help you when you're dealing with mental illnesses such as these should not verbally assault people like he did with me. Maybe he was having a bad day, but that's no excuse. I feel harassed and vulnerable and hopeless - I'm trying so hard not to sink into that goddamn black hole that is depression.





Please, if any of y'all are looking for new doctors/psychiatrists/therapists - do thorough, thorough research on them. Maybe even get in touch with a patient, if you know them, to find out how the doctor really is. I don't want anyone else to go through this. I'm a fucking mess.



***Thank you to everyone for the support. I really, really appreciate it. I will report him.

She's in one of my classes. I was out at a party and headed back home because I got bored and sad. On my walk back Jessica started shouting out my name and ran up and hugged me. It made me feel happier inside :) Just that enthusiasm really got me happy for a moment. Still depressed of course but it's the little things. Her and I never hung out or anything. Just kinda talked about how hard our class is because we sit near each other. It's cool to see that people actually do notice me and care. Happy Halloween everyone

I just feel like I'm weak some days. I'm good at hiding it but I always tell myself "maybe you're not depressed. Maybe you pretend to be this way" a lot. Am I the only one. Even when im fighting back tears, feel like dying, hoping that someone hits me on my motorcycle or just feeling like I have no energy because I feel completely drained after fighting it all day.

I was grocery shopping the other day and basically out of nowhere (although I wasn't having a good day either) I just started crying. I stopped immediately and just had to fight back the tears till I was done. I got back to my car and just cried for a few minutes.



I usually do errands or go places to distract myself from everything, but that's not working anymore. I felt so pathetic.



Does anyone else deal with the same thing?

So this guy (he has a gf, Im closeted bi/gay/whatever male) has recently been super nice to me. He is buying one of those hairless rats and he is explaining to me all the stuff about its care. He is a really nice guy and although we have never hanged out together he is very outgoing and open with everyone (it seems) and Im the opossite. He likes rap a lot and I like some like Death cab for cutie. 



Its not the first time I feel like this, really liking a friend, just because they start talking a lot to me and stuff. He has invited me to go see his rat someday and Im really excited about it.



In the past I lost my best friend in similar circumstances. I loved him, but I couldnt bear that he didnt love me. This has happened two other times not long ago, and I am in the process of stopping those, but a third one arises.



Am I the only one? What is this? This sounds like its named xxxx's Syndrome. I need helo with this.

It may be triggering. To be honest I don't really know where to post it, I figured r/drawing or r/comics would likely tear it to shreds. I know the drawings aren't the greatest. If this isn't appropriate for this subreddit please let me know. I guess I just felt like I needed to get this out.



Anyway, here it is - [Tuesday](http://imgur.com/a/dpmTO)





EDIT - Hey all, OP here -

I just want to say that I am blown away by the reaction to the comic I posted. I never thought I could affect so many people, in a positive way. If anything, let them know that they are not alone, and maybe give those who are not struggling with depression, low self esteem, or social anxiety, a glimpse into what it's like. 



In a way I helped myself. I was feeling incredibly down, alone, and depressed, and I still am. I'm going through a rough time right now, and it was truly, truly helpful to see that other people could relate to my feelings and understand what it's like to be always doubting yourself and the actions of others around you. Thank you all for your kind comments, it really gave me hope - that I could perhaps reach out and help others in some way. 



I sincerely hope all of you who can relate are able to stamp out your negative self talk, and rise above your depression or anxiety. Just know that you are not alone, and there are so many other people out there worrying about what THEY said, or if anyone truly likes THEM... it's easy to forget that when the depression and negativity has consumed your thoughts.



In closing I'd like to thank everyone again for your kind words. I appreciate it, and I hope that every one of you can beat this, because as we all know it's quite painful to live in this way. And I want to repeat what I've learned from this - You are not alone.



Hang in there.

I left the house with my phone, wallet, and a paper + marker to write my final goodbyes. I went to the bridge I planned on jumping off of but backed out at the last minute. I ended up writing a note about my decision and left it at the bridge to try and discourage the next person from jumping. I kind of regret not doing it but I hope my note saves a life so that my day wasn't a complete wash.



Edit: Thank you all. So much.

Wish me luck guys, Ive struggled through some awful shit for the past 20 years of my life and now I found that glimmer of hope- just that glimmer of hope and I want to change my life forever. Going to go all out despite the odds staked against me



EDIT 1: Thank you so much for all the support. Depression is the worst it creeps up on you without notice. I am trying ever so hard to get out from this hole and try to find some success I dearly crave for. Despite the shitty moods, feelings and emotions from being depressed, I want to try and try harder everyday. I admit I havent been successful on some days but hoping yesterday's success is the start of many more success to come. Lets push through kind redditors

He PROPOSED.  As in, I'm nuts but just nuts enough that he wants to make a permanent, life-long go of it with me.  He has seen me on my deepest, darkest, bluest, in-the-ER-sobbing-for-any-type-of-relief days.  He's seen me at the bottom of a wine bottle for relief.  He's held me when I've been shaking and sobbing on the bathroom floor thinking I was about to either physically or emotionally die.  Or both.  



And he still wants this.  Holy shit, there's hope for us all.



Today, I am happy.  :)

I rewatch family guy every night because I find comfort in characters I grew up with. Even unfunny episodes...just seeing Stewie or Peter. I don't know. It brings me back to carefree middle school days.

I'm not sure how to describe this other than home doesn't feel like home anymore.  Home is a place where you're supposed to be happy and relaxed and feel loved. None of those things are true for "home" anymore.

... I kept feeling like every greeting i did to customers entering the shop that it was a fake smile and could feel the need to cry everytime i put one of those fake smiles on. Then it just all came out in front of a lady in her 50's. She didn't really know what to do, but she stayed by my side and talked me through it. I was incredibly embarrassed and I really do not want to go into work again. But if that Old Lady hadn't of been there to somewhat calm me down, I would be in a worse way post shift state than what i currently am. There are always people in the world to help you in the end.

I just want to somehow disappear today and not exist. I have no friends but it sucks when your own family don't wish you on your birthday. I have been alone for many years now, suffering from social anxiety and depression, but never really felt as lonely as I do today.

I was struggling not to cry in front of my mother when I tried to explain what I was going through. She asked me about this subreddit and I told her its not really about giving advice. It's just to let others know, "I understand". Needless to say, after I said that I became a waterfall. I thought of all the suicidal posts.  The amount of pain that we are collectively going through and how "I understand" can give us so much comfort that in some cases it prevents us from pulling the trigger. So much pain, such isolated sea of pain. I freaking love you guys and if someday I were to get rid of this illness I don't see how I will continue my life without helping people like you and me. <3 <3

I have noticed that my depression is so much worse when I'm alone, but I hate spending time with people because of how uncomfortable I feel around them. When I have a day off from work I often choose to be alone and depressed because at least then I can relax. I hate the thought of spending a day off with friends because the day will just be over in a flash, it will have been stressful, and then bam - I'm back at work before I know it, surrounded by people again.

So last night, I met this girl for the second time and realised that I really liked her. *Really* Liked her. Having those feelings for someone again made me realise that I'm not actually too far gone, that I can be normal again. I thought we had really hit it off, (Jokes were shared, we spent quite a while on the way to/back from the club [We didn't make it in...] cuddling under my coat). We bumped into some friends at the bus stop so nothing came from the cuddling, and I went to bed feeling actually, truly happy for the first time in a while. I decided that today I'd call her up and ask her out.



I woke up at 8 the next morning, earlier than I had reason to and just started drawing. After at least 2 hours I'd finished. 



[Here's the picture I drew](http://imgur.com/L62LBka)



After this, a friend of mine came to my room to smoke up with me, and told me that he'd hooked up with her last night. I was sad at first, but realised something.



I don't mind. I feel for the first time in a while that there's hope. If I found someone that could make me happy just by being around me, I'm sure I can find someone like that again.



I've decided that I'm gonna change my life around. From now on, I'm going to fake it till I make it. All the little things I've given up on (Daily showers, laundry, cooking meals ect) I will start doing. I'm going to start boxing /thaiboxing again, and make sure I make my lectures, even if I feel like having a bed day.



Stay strong everyone. Even if you can't see how things could get better at the moment, you just have to reach out into the darkness and hope for the best.



Edit: This has gotten a lot more response than I was expecting, so thanks :) You guys have made my first day of trying to be happy incredibly easy :D. Also, if there's anything I want you to take from the picture, it's that you can be who you want to be. It might seem hard being you at times, but the great thing about being yourself is that you can change and become whoever it is you want to be.



If anyone needs someone to talk/vent to, send me a pm! I promise I'll try to reply to everyone.

It feels almost like guilt. It just weighs in on you, and you see just how unchanging your future is. You wonder if you'll ever have a job that doesn't pay next to nothing and leave you physically exhausted. You'll wonder when your turn to travel the world is. You wonder, and wonder, but it never comes.

My friends got two new kittens. They were so tiny and fragile. I spent many years not trusting myself with animals that small because I'd get violent intrusive thoughts. I knew I'd never act on those thoughts... I couldn't hurt a fly (seriously. If I catch a housefly, I toss it outside.) Still though, the thoughts would become so graphic and disturbing that I'd just avoid handling anything cute (babies, kittens, puppies, anything small and fragile). Plus, I had those thoughts constantly in general. 



I would rather not repeat the content of the thoughts here. All I'll say is that I began having suicidal thoughts and that's when I knew I needed help. 



Recently, I started Wellbutrin. My life's changed *completely*. My intrusive thoughts are pretty much gone. When they *do* crop up, they're so vague that they don't really make sense or have any effect. Plus I have some control over my thoughts now. When I start freaking out about stuff, I'm able to STOP that train of thought before it gets to, "It would be easier if I just killed myself." 



So back to those kittens yesterday: they were sooooooooo adorable. I was afraid at first to even touch them because they were so young. I picked one up and placed him on the bed. I put my face close to him just to see what he would do... and he walked up to me and started rubbing against my face! 



And in that moment, I was so utterly happy. Not only was I having a great time, but I also realized that I wasn't having violent thoughts about the kitten. I was *allowed* to enjoy this, and this was the first time I've allowed myself to enjoy something for so long... I felt tears well up in my eyes.



But I'm not one for crying. Not yet, anyway. So I quickly collected myself and resumed about my day... periodically revisiting those kittens because holy goodness they were so damn *CUTE*.

I hate this ignorance so, so, so, so, so much. Told him I was suffering from some post surgery depression (not that I do suffer from dysthymia as well) and he goes on with this BS and some more. I IMMEDIATELY told him to calm that crap down. Not only do I know about this from a personal standpoint, but an educated one as well. Then he went on this completely irrelevant "I'm sober now" high horse rant about "taking action" and after giving him a thorough explanation of depression I promptly gave him an emphatic goodbye.



Sorry for the rant, but I HATE people like this who have not one single clue what they are talking about, but stick to their ignorant guns instead of taking a damn seat and learning something for once in their lives. And about something so important and central to a person's life as depression? Screw off, quickly.

I'm in the process of deleting my Facebook because on top of depression I have a social anxiety that extends even to the internet. When people on FB do not respond to my posts I feel like no one gives a shit and it feels personal.



When I see how happy other people are with families, friends, etc. I feel more like shit since my life is pretty much shit and I will never have kids, most of my family doesn't even speak to me, and I have 1 friend that I talk to on a regular basis and she is on the other side of the country. 



I even get nervous posting here on Reddit.



I am in therapy and I realize the roots of my social anxiety, but that doesn't make it stop. That on top of the depression is just too much.



Anyone else feel this?



EDIT: Thanks to everyone who answered in this thread. You helped me a lot more than you probably realize.

I'm not at the point of depression where I want to end my life but whenever I'm extra annoyed I have this mantra of saying those things even though I know I don't fully mean it. If I was annoyed in a non depressive state I'd replace those with something like "Aw man, I messed up' "Dammit, made a mistake". Not sure if this is some sort of tick that other people can relate to

I always feel this way. I always feel like I'm burdening someone whenever I try to talk to them and they're just counting down the seconds until they no longer have to talk with me or be around me. I just feel like my presence or any interaction with me is unwelcome and unpleasant.

For anyone who needs their own, controlled, quiet place, there's a game on Steam. It's called Viridi. It's free and quite a small download. You create your own virtual gardening pot where you have to water and take care of your plants as you watch them grow. The music is soft and calming, the atmosphere is very much so the same. I highly suggest this download for anyone who needs to have their own little pot of calm, quiet, happiness.

It bothers me when people use this as an argument against committing suicide. They think they're helping but really they're just confirming what I already know. I know suicide is permanent. That's what makes it such an attractive option. They don't know if my problems are temporary and they shouldn't assume so. Just because eventually I may move out of my abusive father's house doesn't make the abuse any more tolerable. Just because my anxiety doesn't seem like that big a deal doesn't make it easier to live with. When I'm locked in my bathroom because I'm afraid someone is in my house even when I know that no one is, suicide looks pretty great. That's no way to live. My constant self-loathing sure isn't temporary. It's there every second of everyday reminding me just how worthless I am.



I realise that suicide is permanent. That's what I like about it.

It is currently 2015 in Australia and tonight I spent my NYE on the grass in my backyard alone, crying whilst listening to the party happening next door. I was not invited anywhere, nor did I receive any of the generic 'Happy New Year' texts. 

Tonight, however, I can say that I got through one of the hardest fucking years of my life without ending it. My resolution this year is to start celebrating these small wins. No matter what you are doing on your NYE, I hope you are okay and safe, and I am positive that this year may have some amazing things in store for you. 



Edit: Woah I totally didn't expect this level of response, thank you /r/depression for making me feel like I'm not so alone. Thanks to all your kind words I honestly can say that my first day of 2015 has been amazing.

I'm just curious about the different faces of depression. Would you mind sharing yours with me?  

Here's mine: [I'm having a very lazy day](http://imgur.com/CztI61J)  

*Edit: Wow! I seriously didn't expect this many reactions, but I'm really glad how this turned out.  

This morning I thought about how many different kinds of people suffer from depression, and got curious. I just finished watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, figured I'd check Reddit for a moment and saw that the rest of the world had mostly woken up by now and there were around 130 reactions to this post. Many of them beautiful faces in all shapes and sizes, and as it seems even more people commenting really nice things about said faces.  

I just wanted to thank you all and let you know I really appreciate your awesomeness.  

PS: I'm crying ;')*  

**Update:** Please keep sharing pictures! It's never too late to join the party :)  

I've been trying to upvote every single comment but there's 1300 of them now and I have to go to work in half an hour. Once I've forced myself to take a shower, I'll put up a new pic that actually properly shows off my hair ;)

I'm coming to my wits end it seems. I've been doing something wrong my entire life that I can't figure out. I'm  repelling people away from me. I've never had a girlfriend or best friends or really any friends. I'm in college at the moment and the isolation and loniness is driving me insane. Listening to the parties outside makes me want to jump off a cliff. Please help







Edit:



I didn't realize how many people were in the same boat as me. I've been tearing up while reading some of these comments, because some of the things y'all are saying are difficulties that I didn't include in my post. Someone mentioned that they get excited when their phone lights up in hope that it's someone asking them to go out, or eating alone in the dining hall, hating the fact that people "act happy". A lot of these things I can relate too, and clearly many more can relate as well. There's so much more I haven't read, and I just wanted to thank you guys. My morning has been much better reading through all of this. :) I was starting to think that it was just me.

It was early in the morning and no one was home so I decided that this would be the day I do it. I grabbed some rope out of the garage, found out how to tie a noose and got the whole setup completed. I get up to make sure i was all set. I then kicked the table over but the rope snapped at the middle and I fell flat on my ass. I was silent for a second but then I started laughing uncontrollably. It was the greatest laugh I've had in years.



EDIT: Wow guys thanks for all the kind responses! Makes me feel a bit better!

Seriously.  My 29th is coming up in a few days and people can't seem to take the hint that I don't want celebrate it.



My birthdays only serve to remind me that I've wasted yet another year in the same shitty job (been looking for a new one since January; no dice) and the same shitty living situation.  I've pretty much accomplished nothing but managing to keep existing and that in and of itself is pitiful.  Why do people assume I want to celebrate that?

You have no idea how much that actually meant to me...and I wish I could've said thank you at the time.  To be surrounded by so much negativity within my own thoughts, it was nice to actually have someone feel proud of me for once.

And it's all I can think about. I barely know her and it was just something she said after I stumbled into class late. Her friend told me before she could shut her up...you know, the usual girl thing. 





Fuccckk... How pathetic am I. I never thought someone'd actually say that about me and now it's the only thing keeping me going. 





I don't think I'm cute. I can't see it. But fuck, someone actually called me cute.

So, I have a very shy and awkward type of personality, and I've always been this way for most of my life. And I gotta tell you, I HATE MY PERSONALITY WITH EVERY INCH OF MY BODY. I cannot shake it off no matter how hard I try, and now I'm giving up. I have practically no friends, I don't belong anywhere, Nailing a job interview is impossible, Girls of course don't seem to particularly like me, and I just don't get much respect from anyone, and its NOT like I'm a shady ugly character or anything. Im tall, I have a somewhat athletic build, I have nice hair, I have everything physically to be a typical popular jock, BUT MY GODDAMN PERSONALITY IS MY FATAL FLAW. ITS ACTUALLY BEEN 5 MONTHS SINCE IVE ACTUALLY HELD A PROPER CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. Seriously! Im starting to go crazy, I'm actually starting to talk to myself now. I came here because I just wanted to hear someone's voice, even if its just through an internet forum, because I'm incapable of communicating in real life. 





Im in this horrible position when I see some of my old classmates having a blast with massive friend groups, parties, relationships, trips, events, the time of their lives. While I'm here staring at the ceiling wishing for god to stop my heart and remove MISFITS like myself from this earth and put all of us out of our misery. I think I'm actually gonna go for it, I'm going to kill myself soon, and I just wanted to post this so that I guess someone on this site would know. In the future I hope there is a way to detect mental deficiencies such as shyness and awkwardness in the womb before we are born, so that the defective humans like myself can be aborted before we are ever born to suffer in this world which we are engineered to fail in.

Even with lexapro, I've been sleeping my days away. I keep using the peaceful void of sleep to fulfill my longing for the peaceful void of death.



I know a lot of us constantly fantasize and wish for death, but don't have the courage to follow through with suicide. Personally, I just sleep most of the day away and pretend I'm dead while I'm sleeping.



Does anyone have any advice on how to jump start getting more active? Part of it is a lack of energy that I know will significantly improve with more activity. It just seems impossible though. If I can't even get out of bed in the morning, how am I supposed to start exercising? It's a catch 22, need some help please.

Most people here have depression themselves. This isn't a therapy subreddit, the people posting here are just normal people looking for support. Realistically not every submission will be responded to. I think people who post here should be aware that not every post will get attention. Its an unfortunate reality of Reddit that not every post is visible and will get attention.



It might be helpful if the mods put something like this in the sidebar or something, since I see a lot of people angry that their threads didn't get a response.

I don't give a fuck about my IQ. It means nothing if I can't even get out of bed. Don't fucking try making me feel guilty about being depressed and being "smart". 



Yeah I'm an asshole for "bragging" about my fucking IQ. I'm just a waste of this potential you speak of. I wish someone else who wants to live could have this so that everybody would stop guilt tripping me about being so "smart". 



Sorry about this post, I just need to get this off my chest



Edit: I have read every single comment thus far and I've upvoted all of you. If I didn't reply it's mostly because I just don't know what to say but I promise I did read your comments.

I need to prove my dad wrong, I need to show him that I can get an education, get a kickass job and most of all: Be happier and more kind/tolerant than he'll ever be! I'll make people feel welcome, not like they're absolute failures (Nice way to raise kids btw dad, you fucking prick) He never believed that my depression is a real thing, he just said to my face that I was doomed from birth, because "I've always been a little shit" But screw him! I have finally let go of the mental chains he put on me, I'll show him. So thanks dad for giving me strength without trying to, but fuck you for making my childhood miserable. I won't attend your funeral. Also, I'll show you just how much love I can give my future wife and children, because you fucking suck at it. To everyone here: Thanks for reading my wall, the support from this sub has really helped me in hard times when I had no one to turn to :) you're amazing people.

So I went through a shitty breakup about 4 months ago with my first love and I've been heartbroken ever since



Long story short I went to one of her classes and was like "dude I need to get something off my chest". And I told her I was sick of us avoiding eye contact and avoiding each other in the halls and I am sorry that our relationship didn't work out but I just wanted to put that in the past and be friends like we used to.



And now we are and things are okay... I just feel so at peace

Every interviewer is looking for someone happy, motivated and ambitious. Someone who fits the office culture. Someone who they like on a personal level and who seems like a catch in terms of their professional skills.



I am none of these things. I am flat out miserable and I can't hide it. You won't like me and I won't like you. I don't like anybody, especially myself. I'm not ambitious, not motivated, not fun, not nice and not someone you want to spend time with. I don't care about your company and I don't care about your job. I just need an income because I don't have the guts to kill myself.



I send out these resumes and I go to interviews and I try to pretend that I'm somebody else, but they can tell. My smile is so fake I probably look like a serial killer. I don't laugh. I stare blankly into blank walls. I can't even feign enthusiasm. 



I need a job. Desperately. But no one will hire me. Depressed because I'm unemployed, unemployed because I'm depressed. Can't get good jobs because recent work history is shitty. Can't get shitty jobs because less recent work history was pretty good. Overqualified for this, underqualified for that, with the tempermant of sour gas leak.



Everything only gets worse as time goes on. Nothing is working. There doesn't seem to be any way out.



What am I supposed to do?

I don't know what it is, but it's consistent. I'm constantly feeling like time is crawling and I'm not accomplishing anything. But every so often, I have a really fun night with some friends hanging out or playing video games, where everyone laughs and has a good time.



And immediately afterward, I want to die. I always feel like "This would be a good point to stop life. I just had a ton of fun. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and resume the daily struggle to do *anything*. I'll never really accomplish anything, so I might as well end on a high note."



This past Friday was the most recent time. Left a friend's house after a great night of hanging out, and couldn't stop thinking that everything might as well stop now. I even picked out what song I could listen to when I killed myself. Managed to force myself to go home. But I unconsciously took a longer route home that happened to pass by a very tall parking structure. I don't like that I did that. I don't like that my subconscious led me somewhere as if to say "You could always do it here, just like you keep imagining."

*blows party horn*



Quite an achievement I'd say. It's my 23rd birthday tonight so I thought why not treat myself to one of those "basic human need" things?



Edit: You're one of the best reddit communities out there, really. I didn't know I needed this. I mean, I keep telling myself I don't care because I've given up already. But then you keep telling a stranger he's done well when he's trying the simplest things. I get it, too. We're helpful in helping people, we can cheer people up but we can't really help ourselves. And it's good to feel even the littlest encouragement, thank you. /drunk sentiments

Basically, I was diagnosed with depression when I was 10 years old. I'm 25 now, and it has been an uphill battle the whole time. There's a LOT I could go into about what has dragged me down, but one of the big things was my room.



[Before & After](http://imgur.com/a/EwyyI)



(for some reason, it duplicated some of the images while uploading. sorry about that)



I had a LOT of help from a good friend, and I could not have done it without him, but just taking that first step to even start cleaning was huge for me. And I know cleaning it is actually the easy part; it's keeping it this way that's going to be hell.



But just having it clean like this is already such a relief, I am hoping that the idea of clean environment = happier me will motivate me to tidy up a bit every day. Once I get that down, I can move on to other aspects of my life that need attending!

Honestly.  I’m not.



I’ve suffered with depression for most of my life.  The first time depression hit me I was around 10 years old, and this young version of me, with the weight of depression settling upon me, was confused and panicked.  To throw the full weight of depression upon a 10 year old is a very cruel thing to do.  I was very sad.  Nothing made me happy.  The lights seemed dimmer than they were yesterday.  The brisk wind of a long reality of misery was crushing me.



I opened a laboratory inside my head, and invented instruments, and ran tests on myself.  I developed tools, and defences, and coping mechanisms through my teenage years.  I worked on recognizing the triggers of my depression, and if depression seemed to still sneak through my defences, I worked hard to isolate the depression, until it died, dried up, and blew away.  My mental defences became strong and alert and always on guard.



I did have a half-hearted suicide attempt when I was 20 years old.  I was in the service, and we had a short month deployment out to a high altitude location in Nevada.  Despite being desolate, the accommodations were very nice.  The barracks that we stayed in were very similar to a hotel.  We had lots of delicious hot food.  We didn’t work a very demanding schedule.  There was a nice lounge with video games.  My room was warm and comfortable.



Outside of my room, as I would stare out the window, was a beautiful and pristine landscape.  Desolate, but beautiful, and I felt as if I was in God’s country.  It was always quiet outside, with a wind whipping by, and nature staring back at me, uncaringly.



For the first time in a long time, I was happy.  Honestly happy.  I decided that I never wanted to be depressed again.  I would get headaches a lot, so I carried a bottle of naproxen with me.  Not caring whether I actually lived or died, I took about half of the bottle and then went to bed.  I knew that if I did die, that someone would find me when I did not show up to work the next day.  I knew that my parents would be sad.  My friends back home would hear of the news and would be shocked.  But, as I smiled, I would be okay with all of that.



As I fell asleep, I could feel my body start to tingle.  It was a nice feeling, and so I just went with it.



I woke up the next morning, feeling fine, and got my cammies on and went to work.



There was also a time when I was cutting myself.  It was a short period in my life, and I now know why people feel the desire to cut themselves.  It’s to relieve stress.  Just like trying to relieve the pressure inside of a pressure cooker, you have to poke a hole in yourself to relieve the pressure inside of yourself.  Also, since mental pain is invisible, cutting yourself creates a wound that you can see and point to.



Through my 20s I played a dangerous game when I was depressed.  I would pick a date on the calendar, some random date a couple weeks into the future, and I would remember that date.



When that future date would finally arrive, I would think back to the original date, and I would think of what happened in my life during those couple weeks in between, and whether if I had killed myself on that original date, would I have missed anything of importance.  Most of the time, no, I would not have missed anything important.  I did this several times, and never found that I would have missed anything important.



Yes, that was a dangerous game, and I now see how dangerous it was.  Now that I’m past it, and can look back on it, I feel relief.



I’m now in my late 30s.  I have suffered with depression for three quarters of my life.  I have come to the conclusion that I will probably be depressed for the rest of my life, and in opening up with certain members of my family, I have learned that it most likely is hereditary.



I certainly don’t want to be depressed.  I still work hard to defend against it, and I fight to slay it during the times it slips past my defences.  But, really, I come to the conclusion that it’s just a particular trait of mine.  Just like how I have brown eyes and my feet are a size 9, I’m also depressed.  Some people have diabetes.  I have depression.  So be it.



And with recognizing, and acknowledging, and admitting that I have depression, just like an alcoholic admitting publicly in a meeting that they are an alcoholic, it no longer has absolute power over me.  In calling it by its name, I have taken its power away from it.  Whenever I feel horrible, I point at myself and say, “Well, no wonder I feel depressed.  It’s because I am!”



Now, I still deal with it on a daily basis, but anymore, it’s more like a little dark demon that walks beside me.  Sometimes it pokes me in the side.  Sometimes it says some really nasty things to me.  Sometimes I point at it and laugh.  Sometimes we play video games together.  Sometimes we have long conversations.  It’s certainly cranky in the morning, especially while I am trying to get it dressed for the day.  But, it’s always there, and I have come to accept it, so I work with him.



I cry often.  Much more than a male is expected to cry.  For the longest time, I was embarrassed about this, and thought that it only proved my weakness.  Not anymore.  I relish the crying.  When I sense it coming on, I walk away, and once I get to a private area, I let it all out.  I let it all out like I’m vomiting the depression right out of me.  And afterward, like the period after a maelstrom passes, the calm and quiet is one of the most delightful experiences I can think of.  Debris is strewn all around me, but I sit calmly in the center.



My definition of happiness is the absence of pain.  And, I’m fine with that.  My frequency of life may be quite lower than all of the people around me, but that’s okay.  I acknowledge it.  I recognize it.  I embrace it.  The way I handle everyday living is by honestly looking for the little joys in life.



I love open-faced meatloaf sandwiches.  Whenever I see one on the menu, I order it, and every open-faced meatloaf sandwich that I eat is the best one ever.



Instead of focusing on the storm around me, I focus on that beautiful spider web in that tree right over there.  I wonder and marvel at the beauty of it.  I see it waving in the storm, and I see the tiny spider holding on for dear life, and I root for him.  He’s going to survive the storm, and so am I.



So, yesterday was Thanksgiving, and I treated it like a test.  Due to a wonky work schedule, and conflicting schedules with my family, I knew ahead of time that I would be all alone the entire day of Thanksgiving.  With depression, this can be scary.  But, I decided to embrace it and see what happens.  Granted, my antennae were up and working full time to detect any oncoming storms, but I felt safe and confident that I would be able to handle anything that came my way during the day.  I purposely put myself into this position and gave the demon the advantage, just to see what happened.



And so, yesterday, I woke up and I slapped the demon beside me and said, “Come on.  What are you waiting for?  Are we doing this, or not?”  And I dragged him along with me all day long, on purpose.  I chided him.  I taunted him.  I threatened him.  I made fun of him, and I laughed at him.  We threw barbs back and forth at each other all day long.  He tried to scare me.  I called his mother fat.



I made it through the day, and in the evening, I was enjoying some beers, sitting with my demon on the couch, and we were binge-watching episodes of the show “Life”, which was cancelled back in 2008, but remains to be one of my favorite modern day shows.  By night time, my demon was worn out, and I was quite tired myself.  I had survived the day.  I had thrived through the day.  I smiled, and I fell asleep.  The demon was snoring contently beside me.



In a couple short hours, I will be travelling to spend some time with family over this Thanksgiving holiday.  I have a lot to be thankful for.  The demon will now be on my turf.  He will have the disadvantage.



Everything is okay.



It’s all okay.

Have I passed the point where I'm supposed to stop counting? I'm alone on my birthday. I have no friends and bad relationships with my family. I've never been married. I don't have any kids. I haven't had a significant other in over 20 years. Not that I haven't tried, mind you. I've had to endure more humiliating rejections than I care to remember. Apparently I was never quite good enough.



I always tear up whenever I see those ads on TV about animals who don't have a home with someone to love and care for them. How ironic it is that I would find myself in the same situation. At any rate, I'm still here, and I've all but accepted my fate. I'm not trying to fish for sympathy, but if any redditors out there can spare a kind thought for a moment for a lost soul, you have my heartfelt gratitude.



Thank you kindly for reading. :)



EDIT: OMG, thank you to everyone! I had no idea that doing this one thing would generate a response bigger than anything I expected. I guess being in my 40s, without a wife or kids or anything, I was feeling lonely, old and useless. But dammit, I'm not dead yet! Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I can't do things I still enjoy. And I really do love animals, so I'm going to think of a way that I can get myself to spend more time around them. Thank you, you guys have truly made this a happy birthday! :-)

Other than migraines, headaches, stomachaches, etc. caused by my mental state, it hurts to... exist. My heart hurts. I'm that sad. Wondering if I'm crazy and should go to the doctor or if others feel like this.

Every single night, I go on Facebook. I go through a list of friends I've made that appear in custom lists, and I check to see if these friends are awake past 1 am. It's my list of depressed people, and if any of them are awake, I message them, and make sure they get to bed okay. Then, I go on Yik Yak, and look for any depressed Yakkers. I comfort them, and get them to bed safely too. Only then can I ever rest. 





I've been depressed and alone too many times. I will never let it happen to anyone ever again.

Call me a bitch and all, but who the fuck intentionally downvotes a post by someone who is struggling and/or just venting? The only probable cause I could see in doing that is if the person is attacking somebody else or saying hateful things. But my god, some of you are like a cancer on some of these folks who honestly have nowhere else to turn or have nobody in life. And it's really sad to see that a majority of these posts aren't 100% upvoted when I could think of no reason as to why they deserve a downvote. But I guess there's always gotta be that asshole, right? 



Sorry for ranting, just gets on my nerves when I see broken people on here possibly getting more shredded by the thought of somebody downvoting their post. :(

My son is 23 years old. He married his high-school sweetheart in 2010. She was a law school student and he worked from home to help support them. On Nov. 8th of this year, she was messing around with a gun (a revolver), took out all the bullets but one. She was just trying to get a reaction from my son and instead, she put the gun to her head not knowing the location of the bullet and pulled the trigger. My son watched the entire thing.

 We had to move him out of that house and in with us. Come to find out, about a year and a half ago, my son and his wife started drinking heavily. My son is now an alcoholic. He was arrested a couple of days ago for DUI but doesn't admit he's an actual alcoholic...but he says "I might have a drinking problem". 

When he was 16 years old, I let him move in with his Girlfriend (who later became his wife). She was going to college already while he was just a Jr. in high school. She was a very controlling person. She didn't mean to be. I loved her very, very much and respected her but she used to force my son to drink with her. She actually asked me one holiday before they even got married to please talk to my son and make him have a few drinks so he can relax. At the wedding, her stepfather was forcing her to drink. I felt very uneasy about the whole thing. 

My husband helped me and my son clean the accident scene. I know there are people for that but we didn't have time to wait. We had to get back to work and pack up the house in 2 days. I have visions of all the blood on the walls, the ceiling, the floors. We had to dispose of things that were saturated in blood. Bags and bags of clothes, sheets, electronics, dishes (they were messy people) were bagged up and taken to the dump.  And what bothered me even more was that they kept all the Vodka bottles that they had ever drank. There were over 50 in a year and a half. These were the larger bottles…not the 750ml. I started doing the math and it scared the hell out of me. 

So...i'm dealing with a lot. The first 2 weeks after the accident I cried non-stop. I was afraid they would blame my son. It's still possible that he will get blamed for this. Since they were heavy drinkers...there were quite a few screaming matches between the two. She would always be the one to call me, her friends, her family, when they were arguing and say things that she would later regret. She stopped calling about 2 months before.  

 The last time I saw her was about 2 weeks before her death and I was disgusted with her. She was spiraling downward fast. She got so drunk that she made a complete fool of herself in front of my son's high school friends. I felt sorry for her. I am trying to understand all of this. 

Right before the death, I lost my income. My husband is the only one making money and it’s not enough. I was self employed and had several people working for me but I lost a huge contract and had to let everyone go. So, in other words, I can’t afford a therapist until I gain another contract.

My son, however, is seeing a therapist only once a week. In January, his new insurance will kick in and he will be able to go 2 x’s a week. My problem right now is I have all these visions in my head of my beautiful daughter in law. She actually lived for 2 days after the shooting until we unplugged her. Her head was swollen and bruised. She was brain dead the moment the gun entered her skull. I had to go to the emergency room because every time I cried, I would get violently ill and a splitting headache from a rise in blood pressure.

Today, I view death differently. I don’t believe in God. I used to…or should I say that I was one of the billions of people that got sucked into believing in him. What I do believe is when we die, our life ends. No memory. No meetings at the pearly gates. No facing our maker. If God really created us, then he would be a magician. I think we are just these molecular machines that have miraculously evolved through trial and error. I’m sure many will disagree but I finally have a clear vision of death. But, I still worry.

Every morning, I wake up on the negative end. I am a worrier; always have been. I try not to be and overall I am actually a happy person but I can’t help but worry.

My son stays out all night. He made a promise to me that he will be home Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesday nights. He works with my husband so I get to see him all day M-F. One of his good friends texts me quite often and tells me that he’s worried about his drinking. He has tried to speak to my son about it but I think my son is still in denial. I actually think that he is seeing someone. His wife has been dead for 1 month. I can’t stop worrying.

I have so many other things that I worry about. My father who used to be homeless is living with us now that shits and pisses on himself and doesn’t bathe for 2-3 weeks at a time until he is forced. My mother who lives in our guesthouse is extremely judgmental and thinks that if others don’t do it her way, it’s the wrong way and certainly doesn’t resist in telling EVERYONE ABOUT IT. My daughter who is 20 and has given me the most sweetest grandbaby in the world but has ADHD and is crazily unorganized and also is with a complete thug of a guy who verbally abuses her. Oh…and I went from having 3 dogs to having 5 dogs, 4 cats, and a hedgehog. So, my mother helps clean the house in exchange for rent and I will never hear the end of the continuous amount of pet fur that has to be removed from the carpets.  And, as I mentioned earlier, I lost a HUGE contract so our income was cut 65%. 



I try to see the positive in things. I have a nice house, my car will be paid off in June, my son is in therapy and is forced to be in AA because of the DUI, and I have this absolutely perfect grandchild but I can’t get these thoughts out of my head.

I need help.

I've been trying to capitalise on this 'Ive given up' feeling recently,  try make it work in my favour I guess.



I got my haircut very short as it was very long. I then sat in a burger joint and ate on my own. I had a few panicky moments before I went in, but once I just did it, it was ok. I got a few looks from the staff. Im not sure if they were laughing at me, or if they were just being nice. It was probably a bit of both.



I went to the gym tonight too. Trying to feel better about myself really. I enjoyed it.



I still miss my friends greatly, I wish they were around to have come to the burger place today.  I can't wait until they come back from Uni.



I've not moved forward. I still miss my friends,  I still worry over past decisions, I can't sleep at night and my relations with women remain a big fat 0.



But even if I'm not swimming to the shore,  at least I'm treading water. Seeing a band who I absolutely adore and have got me through some rough times (The Wonder Years) in November. Excited for that.



Just an update I guess. Thanks for reading if you did.



EDIT: Holy shit. Ok so I hate this whole 'omg front page' shit on Reddit but I feel like I should say something.



I wrote this in 10 minutes before I waited for my Ps3 to load to play some Fifa last night. I had no idea it would become as popular this has but i'm glad people are finding comfort in it. I think writing about your day/week can be very therapeutic, and i'm happy to see people posting in this thread about their day. How about we have a "What did you do this week?" weekly thread or something on this sub? Might be worth something. 



Secondly, I want to give a big shout out to /u/mobiuschick. When I posted on this sub a long long time ago, she helped me even when my post fell to the second page with no comments. I thank her for that greatly, (I actually can't find the post, maybe i deleted it or it's on another throw away I can't remember.) Also, she posts on this sub DAILY helping people out. It's pretty amazing and she deserves to be recognized for it.



Lastly, if you want to read more about my situation then you can check my post history on this account, but i advise you don't. I've come to realise I don't really enjoy talking about every little detail and that i'd rather just get on with life and try and improve myself.



Thanks for all the comments, i've not been too down recently too be honest, and this thread just made things even better. I feel like I want to be remembered for MORE than what I am really. I want to be the guy who beat depression AND THEN did something. I'm still working on the first part right now.

I've been paying 50 bucks a month for daily bus rides to school, and today I decided it was enough. I have 5.7 km (3.6 miles) to school and I fucking did it. It took a little more than half an hour, and I did stop to throw up once, but I fucking managed to take the bike to school. And I'm sorry for cursing, but I'm just so damn pleased, and I wanted to share it somewhere.  



The sun is shining, I have a soda in my hand and I actually did something. I thought I was gonna burst into tears when I finally made it to school. 



I'm gonna go to math class and do absolutely nothing, now. And I'm also going to beat myself up over that. But at least I'll remember that I actually managed to go by bike for the first time in nearly a year. 



Thanks for reading, and sorry for taking up your time. 



EDIT: Thank you all very much for your nice comments and upvotes! They've elevated my spirits even higher than before. Also, thank you very much, who ever gave me gold for this. You all have inspired me to try and make this a habit. So thanks again, thank you thank you, thank you, for all your kindness. I'm very grateful I've been smiling more these two days than I've done for a very long time. This is feeling incredibly cheesy so I'm gonna end it here, but thanks again! ^ U ^

I'm always on my phone looking at stupid stuff probably on reddit until like 4am or until im literally going to fall asleep on my phone. I know that if I turn my phone off and go try sleep I'll be left thinking stupid horrible things and I don't want that.

I don't want to talk to people about being depressed anymore. I just want to rest my head in someones lap or just have a really long hug. I just want to know that at the end of the day someone believes in me and actually gives a genuine fuck about how I feel.

This week represents the worst week of my life. My fiance and partner for 10 years got into a motorcycle accident on Nov 13 and died the 20th, 3 years ago. 

After CPT Therapy to manage the PTSD symptoms, I actually felt grief and sadness over the loss of my partner for the first time in 3 years. It is gut wrenching and heart breaking. 

Today, I showered for the first time since the 13th. It took so much energy, but I feel a bit better bc of it. Just had to share with someone.

I attempted to hang myself by tying a belt to my bed frame.  It started almost as an impulsive decision. "Stop fucking around with the idea and do it already" were the kind of though in my head.  I stopped it as soon as I started to pass out and "realized" that I would die if I lost consciousness.  I cried, for a while, and I started thinking that I would have to put my life goals on hold, just to focus on not killing myself.  When I had that thought the noose I had made looked awfully inviting.  Instead I called someone who I love and who seems to love me unconditionally.  It was hard to admit to her what I'd done.  I begged her for forgiveness before I could even tell her.  



I'm glad I called her.  I'm glad I didn't kill myself.  I'm going to go eat chocolate because being alive means I get to eat chocolate.  



I'm in a very weird place right now.  I'm only ~2 hours from the attempt.  I hope that before anyone else commits suicide they call someone they love.  I could be dead right now.  I could have been dead by 20 seconds. but I'm not I'm here I'm alive and I'm going to eat some chocolate.

I'm a 17 y/o female living with my parents and two sisters ages 20 and 23. I am diagnosed with Mood Disorder NOS (but they're leaning towards bipolar), OCD, and GAD. I take Effexor 150 mg, Klonopin .25 mg.  Okay, so to what happened.



I was home alone, and contemplating hanging myself with a makeshift bedsheet noose I had crafted, but I couldn't find anything to tie it to, so I decided just to drink instead and hope the feeling would pass.



I had a glass of wine and decided to do an online chat with suicide hotline (I've never contacted them before) so I could talk to somebody about it. That's when my 20 y/o sister K comes home, looks at my laptop, reads the last thing I typed, and starts screaming at me saying I'm so fucking stupid and just a bunch of other rude things for talking to the online person. Then she assumes that I'm super drunk because she read that I drank. Now I'm not a lightweight and one glass of wine doesn't even have me tipsy.



That's when my mom walks in the house for her lunch break and all hell breaks loose. My sister screams at her that I'm wasted and contacting suicide hotline. Well, my mom doesn't give a shit if Im trying to kill myself, she is just super angry at the prospect of me taking her alcohol and she starts screaming at me and backing me into a corner of my bathroom. 



I get really scared of her because she's very scary when she's angry and I scream at her to get the fuck away from me and I'm really emotional at this point so I scream I fucking hate you and she starts to slap and punch my head. I immediately start screaming and run for the front door when my sister tackles me and digs her nails into me. She's saying horrible things to me and I lose my cool and admittedly hit her back in the face. 



I get loose and my mom rips me back by my hair, and I'm super scared now because my family is attacking me because they think I'm drunk and have lost my mind. I run upstairs and bang on my big glass window to idk, get help? That's when my sister grabs my arm and by this point I have yelled at least 100 times to "not touch me, please stop touching me". So I've had it and I'm terrified so I slap her again. 



She tackles me to the ground, landing on my arm (it's very hard to use now and is cut up and severely bruised) and just wails on me at least 10 times. My parents are both home now and just watching her do this when they see blood all over my face and decide now is a good time to get her off. 



Now my parents tell me to pack my stuff, I'm going to the hospital to be institutionalized. I've been institutionalized before on my own account and I *was* *not* going back. My dad makes me get into his car to go, but not before giving me a wet towel to pacify the blood streaming from my nose and mouth. My lips were and still are super busted and swollen. I look like I've having an allergic reaction. 



I end up not going because I tell my dad that I'm not going to sugarcoat the story and that my mom and sister would either get into trouble, or I'd be placed into foster care, so he gets worried and takes me back home.



My parents are seemingly kind to me now, but my sister is still harassing me and emotionally abusing me and it's gotten to the point that I'm scared to be by any of them and have locked myself in my room. I just turned 17 and I have nowhere to go so I don't know what to do. My mom (who works at the police station) said she talked to a PO and he said if I told anyone that story I would be the one getting a record because I was drinking so I pretty much have no options besides living in fear. What am I supposed to do?



Edit: Should have mentioned this, I really cannot call the police in my city. My dad is the magistrate, his brother is the judge, my mom does some kind of clerk work there and has fucked at least 1/3 of the officers, and my sister who beat me is always over there doing ride alongs and such; they absolutely love her over there on account for her being very attractive and having huge tits. They will 100% not side with me.

Second year university student here. Just found out i've totally bombed the semester thanks to hardly being able to make it through each day rather than concentrating on university. After speaking to a lovely lecturer I figure the worst case scenario will be that I have to retake the year. I'm just so angry that after already taking 6 years of my life so far this will be another wasted one all thanks to this horrible illness. and I don't know what to say to parents as they have super high expectations and invalidate my mental health issues. hahah fuck my life, I don't want to be here.

We are not just "sad" or being pathetic.  our disease is no different than any other body/chemical disease (like cancer, MS, Lupus, etc).  Asking us to "Suck it up and stop being pathetic" is the same as asking a paralyzed person to "suck it up and get out of that wheelchair and stop feeling sorry for your self".



For me, I don't think the non-depressed population has a clue what we go through every hour of the day.  Many days it takes all my strength just to elevate myself up to a level of "really sad".

It's just that depression often gets blamed on the person, as if you could *fully* control what you think/feel, as if you could snap out of it easily. I just wish people would treat depression more legitimately, like they would physical illnesses.

I am(hands raised). 



I lie to people everyday, family, friends, everyone, I don't discriminate. I say things I don't mean, give smiles I don't intend, gesture like an a-list actor because if I showed my true hand, I'd be even more alone. I pretend, I kid, all framed by fantasies of death and despair seconds apart. 



Misery loves company but attracts none, so I'm a liar. One of the best.

I told myself that I was going to be okay with a small win today. So I have three things on my list.



1. Get out of bed (which I have done).

2. Clean up my apartment (which I am in the process of doing).

3. Eat something and keep it down (which ... I'm going to work on).



I just... wanted to post this somewhere. And I'm not ready for my entire Facebook to know that I'm dealing with stuff... and I'm sick of bugging my friends about this. I just wanted someone to know that today... I got out of bed. 



Edit: Thanks so much for all the support!! It's been a really rough week, but you guys have really helped me finish it out. I wish each and every one of you the best... Thanks so much y'all!!

So my lack of drive and interests means all I do in my free time is numb my brain with YouTube videos that I don't remember the content of 5 minutes after watching, sums up pretty much anything I do on the internet really. So my life seems extremely boring, and it is. I sleep in whenever I can, I have no plans for the future and no projects I've finished. I usually can't hold a conversation for very long , because, well, I have nothing to talk about. But oh boy, that doesn't mean my brain is like that, I constantly fight suicidal thoughts, my depression nukes my anxiety and it retaliates with waves of anxiety attacks and sleepless nights. I don't even know how I've made it this far but if I keep going like this I'll become a vegetable and my brain will explode. 



I can't relate to people much anymore because I don't "experience" life the same way. Making new friends is practically impossible and keeping the ones I've made is becoming increasingly difficult.

I have been struggling with PTSD and depression since I was little. In December I was let go from a dream job due to a reduction in the work force. Since then my depression has gotten worse as I feel no self worth due to no job. I have no health insurance due to a snafu with social security (long, horrific story) and no access to my anti depressants and anxiety medication.



I found myself masturbating with my knock off hitatchi wand several times a day to lift my mood for a few minutes and to help fall asleep. Sadly, my wand died last night and I have no replacement. It was only after it died that I realized how dependent I was on the orgasms to help combat depression and sleep issues. Does anyone else use orgasms to help with depression?

I am black. I'm a woman. I'm also fat. Everyday I have to deal with microagressions centering around my race, gender, and size. I've been call intimidating. I've been accused of being unapproachable. People assume I can handle a great deal of verbal abuse. Here's the truth: I'm shy and have social anxiety. I'm super sensitive. I've been depressed for half my life. I have a hard time standing up for myself. I'm lonely and it's difficult for me to make friends. Everyday I have to talk myself into going to work because little comments about my identity really do get to me. I just wish people would stop assuming that I'm this strong invulnerable creature.

Hello everyone, I really don't know how to put it so I'll come out and say it. My life is a mess, I really do want to die but I don't have the desire...or the guts to commit suicide. I've lost all my friends, school doesn't interest me at all, nothing seems fun or worthwhile anymore, my girlfriend left me a year ago this month and my dream job is out of reach. I feel cynical about everything and I hate the world I can't even find happiness with my family because they all either shoot down my hopes and dreams or are constantly fighting with one another over stupid things. I want to stress that I have not and do not intend to hurt myself in anyway but I truly wish I died in some way, a car crash, cancer, a mugging gone wrong. I feel like I have complete disregard for my own life now. I even walk down the worst neighbourhoods at night, alone, hoping something would happen. I keep telling myself if I don't die or reach my dream I should just fly to France and enlist in the French Foreign Legion...It looks like all my options are gone now. Please comment open and honestly but respectfully on what i should do. Thank you all for reading and hearing me out where others in my life have not.

I feel like this happens on a regular basis. I start to think a little more positive or I begin to feel a little happy only to have it ruined a minute later by something stupid or meaningless. I seem to even create problems out of nowhere because of how I think sometimes.



Anyone else?

After being best friends with my neighbor during middle school and high school, we sort of drifted apart after graduation (juniors in college right now). But we live right next to each other so it shouldn't be hard right? 



He almost never invited me to hang out with my other friends during the summer so I was stuck at home doing nothing and they consistently posted it on social media for two summers straight. 



I finally got the courage to text him today and ask him if he wanted to get food. His response was "I'm sorry, who is this?"



The sad thing is that he's the only contact in my phone that isn't a family member..

Like the reason people don't want you around them isn't because you did something wrong, or because they're assholes, but because everything about you as a person is just disgusting?And no matter what you do, you can't figure out how to fix it, or how to make it better?  Because i have.



It seems no matter what i do, it'll be never get better. Because the problem isn't other people, the problem isn't even mental illness. The problem is me. The problem is that i can't empathize with most people. The problem is that i'm a self centered asshole who wants everyone to be nice to me 100% of the time. Because i don't give a fuck about other people's feelings. I wish i could, but everytime i try it just feels fake to me. What am i doing wrong? 



Please help.

My 17 year old son chose to end his own life three months ago. In his note he said, "I love you, Mom. I'll always love you, even after my heart stops beating."  I'm not religious. I beg you not to talk to me about God or heaven or a "better place". Today, I can't stop crying. I miss him so damn much it's overwhelming. I'm pushing away thought after thought of my own suicide for the sake of my other two sons. Please lie to me. Tell me some how some way his energy or the spark that was him  exists and does still love me. And maybe more importantly, that he can still feel the unconditional love I had /gave to him in life...



EDIT: I want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time and effort to share yourselves with me. There is so much pain in life but you've also shown me how much love and grace exists, too.

Does anyone else feel almost...fetishized when people who know that you wanna die campaign so hard for you to Not Kill Yourself but then they don't take any action that actually helps you? Like, I would never expect someone to overextend themselves or do me favors that they can't afford to do, but I just wish that if someone isn't prepared to actually do something about my situation, they wouldn't fucking tell me to not kill myself. It just makes me feel even shittier. 



It's not like I wouldn't try to live and survive and feel better if I knew what steps to take and was strong enough to take them. But no, I literally fucking CAN'T so unless YOU are prepared to somehow turn my "can't" into a "can", I don't want to hear a word out of your mouth about how I shouldn't kill myself because IT. JUST. MAKES. ME. FEEL. WORSE.



~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~



Edit: a lot of people are making assumptions and projecting a lot of things in these comments. I want to clarify that I can appreciate that friends, family, etc genuinely care even if they don't know how to help or do not have the resources to help. THAT IS FINE AND OKAY. What's not okay is them telling someone what to do (not kill myself) if they are not able and willing to contribute actionable efforts to help get a suicidal person to a better place. Because I don't feel like killing myself because I **want** to--I don't!!!--it's because I feel like I have to and am currently unable to adjust my life to where I won't feel like that anymore.



Like, are you gonna pay the hospital bills for checking myself in? Are you gonna find me a therapist who is actually helpful and doesn't disregard or dismiss things that are intertwined with my issues? Are you going to pay for my costs of living while I lie in bed for the 2-6 months it takes for medications to start working? No? Okay, well then here starts my search for a very tall balcony to jump off of.

Firstly, I just want to say this to everyone on this subreddit, **Thank you**.

I don't know where I would be without you, or if I would even be anywhere at all. I've actually talked to a lot of people on here, and to be honest, all of them have helped me in their own way.



But I don't belong here anymore. I don't wake up in the morning, wishing I had died in my sleep. I'm not in the awful place I have been in, anymore. And r/depression is such a big part of that. I'm not saying that someone else can cure your depression, but a friend can help more than at least I could have ever imagined. So please, if you have the energy, try to be there for each other. 

Because no one should be alone in a dark place.



I don't think I'm the only one who has dreamt about a button that, if pressed, would erase you from this life. A button to end your suffering, without leaving other people to grieve over your death. And you know what? If I had that button in front of me right now.... I wouldn't press it. 

Life isn't suddenly easy, but it doesn't feel like I'm constantly walking against the current. I can laugh again.



I don't know if this is stupid, but i just wanted to show to all of those who seriously doubt it's possible, it *can* change for you. I was severely depressed and I honestly wanted to die. But it got better for me. I wanted to say thanks and goodbye, because I'm unsubscribing this subreddit.



But if anyone ever needs someone to talk to, please write to me. No matter how unimportant you think you are, reaching out to someone could literally save a life. I know it did for me.



EDIT: thank you for all your nice responses!



EDIT 2: ok, your responses have been overwhelming. I wasn't sure whether to post this, since positivity and other people getting better sometimes only emphasizes your own misery, and I really didn't like that. But all the lovely comments you've given me, really made me happy.

I'm am actually having kind of a shitty couple of days, but I just saw the little cake icon by my name.



1 year ago I was SO much worse off.



It's been a year of ups and downs, but many more ups, and I hope that if anyone's reading this and feeling suicidal, you'll procrastinate on it ;) or reach out for help.



Good luck to everybody in this sub and pm me if I can support you at all. I love you guys.

I had a rather shitty homelife growing up..an abusive, bitter adult doesn't just affect the childs life for that moment in time, it affects them forever. After 4 years of councilling I'm only just beginning to realise how this has altered my life..The way I dealt with abuse growing up was to separate it from myself completely..it wasnt me, i didnt want him to become part of my personality, I didnt want him to have anything to do with me. "Me" at home was not "me" at school. At school I was normal at home I was 'thick'..I was 'stupid'..I was 'ugly' and I was beaten..but at school I was fearless, I was completely unbothered by name calling, cause of my homelife I could take anything, any heckle. I gave myself this mindset, I could deal with anything. But now when I look back, I can see, I was a ten year old that was blank..I wasnt normal...I remember the teacher asking us to say one good thing about ourselves that we liked, and I had nothing, I couldnt do it. When I looked in the mirror I saw nothing.









I'm 27 this year, and I unwillingly left home when I was 17  in a 'Its me or her situation' proposed by my step father. My mother chose him- which I do understand, she had two other kids with the man and she didn't want to be alone. I'm nearly 27 and I've never felt like a full proper person..I dont know if this is a normal way to feel? 









When I lived at home, I'd only draw..I was the most productive kid, I was obsessed. I managed to get into a great art college, but unfortunatly was kicked out of home just as I was about to start, I didnt go in as much,  as the police and my our next door neighbour were trying to get me to press charges or similar against my step father. I wouldnt as my mother said she wouldnt speak to me ever again..I managed to get into university somehow and studied illustration. I felt like I was falling apart though, but managed to get through. I now live in London, trying to build a career.











On the outside people think, she's doing well. But on the inside, I'm in debt because of domino affect of money problems from when I was 17 and kicked out..I am a nervous wreck..I am bitter like he is because I didn't turn out like I wanted to. I didn't want to be a product of his abuse, and now I'm just coming to terms with the fact I largely am. 









But what I did do recently, which shocked me was paint a portrait, my first portrait in years. It's Thom Yorke from Radiohead ha! It's done digitally. Painting it healed me a little bit-that might be corny. It soothed me a bit maybe...I haven't felt like that in a long time..







Anyway, here you go guys:

I'm at a point where I feel tired of trying. I feel worthless, I feel unlovable and after the last couple of months, I feel completely shattered. 



The same things happen over and over and I'm tired. I'm tired of wondering what I'm doing wrong. I'm tired of slowly opening up to someone intimately only after they've opened up to me first just to end up the one that helps them heal and eventually leave.



I'm tired of how bad it hurts. I'm tired of not being enough. I'm tired of people telling me how *strong* I am when I don't want to fucking be strong anymore. I'm tired of hearing my friends and family tell me that they love me and try to use that to make me feel guilty for feeling depressed and sometimes suicidal. I'm tired of it because when they say it even if I k ow they mean it it means absolutely nothing. 



They're not what I want. They're not who I want and I can't tell them that I honestly don't give a shit how they feel about me. It doesn't make me feel anything. 



I feel empty towards everyone and everything but one person. 



The things I cared about once don't ignite passion in me anymore. 



I could take my meds. I could talk to my doctor. I could schedule counseling. I know the drill. 



I just don't want to. I don't see a point anymore. 



I don't care. 



I'm not actively planning my death at least not today. I just don't care about my life. 



Someone tell me that makes sense. Please



Edit: Thank you guys. I've felt for so long that I couldn't voice or explain this because my loved ones just don't get it. If nothing else, it feels good to hear that other people understand. 



Edit: took a lot of pills tonight. Drank a lot. Thanks to everyone who understood. I just can't do it anymore. 

Thanks for the extra day.

I feel like because I'm a boy with depression I'm just expected to 'be happier'. It seems like girls and emo's are the only people that ever get diagnosed. I had to tell my parents that I was depressed and suicidal because there was no outside proof of it. Boys see boys with depression as weak, like they have a choice or that they are just grumpy and it really pisses me off. I never cried in front of anyone and always had to hide my depression in the fear of being a 'pussy'.this led to some really dark times where I was screaming at the top of my lungs and and crying uncontrollably and hitting things when I was alone because it was the only way I could get rid of my feelings without anyone else knowing. I feel like it is seen as a bigger deal for girls to have depression even though it can affect anyone.



Thoughts?



PS: I'm not saying it isn't a serious issue in girls, I'm just saying it is more difficult for boys to openly speak about it and seek help.

Does anyone else feel this way? I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona when I'm with my friends sometimes. I'm that "funny laid back chill dude" who is "nice" and "caring". Although I may be nice and caring, inside, it's different story. I hate myself so much. But I also don't want to confide because I have no true close friends, I only have friends who are a step above acquaintances.

I have had a pretty fucking awful semester of college, and I am just so excited. I took the chance cause I was like what could go wrong? And now I am going on a coffee date at 2. I don't know what to expect and that excites me. 



She seems like a really interesting girl too. 



I haven't felt nervous for anything in the past four months, but now I'm super nervous. It's such a weird feeling. 



Who knows what's going to happen?!

It says "you don't have a condition, or a disorder. You're just a lazy, selfish dope who mopes around for attention." When that voice starts going off, that's when I feel the most depressed. Isn't it ironic? I don't know whether to believe I have depression or I'm just a whiny little whimp. It's nights like these when I have the creeping sensation that I'm an objectively bad person.

I don't know why. I've just recently woken up from this haze of negativity and self hatred. I literally just woke up one day and felt on top of the world. Colors are brighter, music is more beautiful. I want to smile and dance. Keep your heads up guys. Better days are ahead. Keep going.

During the extra-long vacation after my exams this year I have been coping with depression . I feel like over time it became worse, and harder and harder to even get out of bed, let alone prepare for university which is starting in 4 weeks.



Today though, I pushed myself to excercise. So I did. I pushed every last bit of energy that I had out of my body, and then continued until I just couldn't anymore.



And now I feel something that I haven't felt for a long time. And that is the lust to go do stuff. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do now.



And mayby tomorrow will be shit, and the weeks after that too. But I'm ready for it. I will survive.



EDIT: thank you all for your kind words, you are wonderful people! :)

Does anyone else think this way? I've flirted with fantasies of suicide before but I've never thought of it as a realistic "way out"; the thought of what it would do to my friends and family, especially my younger brothers, if I killed myself means I doubt I will ever attempt.



However, I'm still gripped by the desire to just disappear, to escape from myself and from being a burden to people. I know it may be somewhat naive to think it, and I've slowly managed build trust about my problems with a couple of close friends and my parents but I can't help but think they'd be better off without me. I feel outright guilty sometimes for not being strong enough, for not being there for friends.



Anyway, thanks for reading. I'm at one of my really low moods and felt like writing something down.

In a month or two, I have maybe one day when I feel like why was I even worried about anything? This is my life, I can control it. I can accomplish what I've set out to do. 

Then, the other day it's a downward spiral back to same old feelings of despair, helplessness and an inability to do anything.

I don't want to commit suicide. I'm afraid I'd fuck up, or it'd be really painful, or it would traumatize my family. But I don't want to live either. 



So sometimes I fantasize about being diagnosed with terminal cancer or something. Then I'd just lie in the hospital for a few months, go to Oregon, get assisted euthanasia, and die peacefully. Or, when I'm walking in the street, I imagine getting hit by a truck and dying instantly. Does anyone else ever feel this way?

But I have casual thoughts of suicide all the fucking time. They almost never mean anything, probably like 1 in 500,000 or something crazy like that will be me actually thinking about offing myself, but I'll be walking to class on any given day and I'll just think "oh hey I should kill myself" or I'll think about what it would look like.



I don't remember when that started being normal.



I don't like this being normal. I should have a strong reaction to it. I'd never tolerate another person telling me to kill myself or that they were going to kill me, and I definitely wouldn't think it was okay if someone handed me a painting of my body crumpled up in the shower with the top half of my head missing.



Why is it okay when I do it to myself? Why am I not repulsed by this shit?

I lie to my therapist. Sometimes I'm embarrassed. Sometimes I'm scared she won't like me anymore or she'll think less of me or judge me. Sometimes I don't want to admit things to myself or say them out loud. But therapy is fucking expensive and why the fuck am I going if I'm just going to sit there on her couch and be like, "Yeah, life is great. I'm a *little* stressed, but tomorrow's another day right? Right? Heheheheh." 



No more. Starting today I've made it a rule that I am not allowed to lie to her. I can choose not to answer certain questions or ask that we change the subject if I don't feel like talking about something, but I will not outright lie to her. If something is so hard to talk about that I can't say it out loud, I'll write her a note. 



And that includes being honest with her about the things she says and my thoughts on them. That includes telling her when I disagree with her or don't feel that her advice is helping me. That includes telling her how I feel when she says certain things. 



Hopefully by doing this, she can get a better idea of what needs to be worked on. Because she can't hold me accountable and call me out on my bullshit and teach me how to get my life together if I just sit there and tell her that I'm a *little* depressed, or that I don't think about suicide at all, or that I feel okay, or that I've been eating healthy and getting enough sleep. She needs to know. If she judges me for telling the truth then she's a shitty therapist and I'll find a new one. **I don't need her to like me. I need her to help me.**

Like my title says, people these days don't seem to give two fucks about depression, anxiety, or any other mental disorder that doesn't affect THEM. 



Even when it leads to disastrous consequences. Take for example what happened in Calgary; 5 people were stabbed to death by someone who had mental problems in the past and likely had some kind of schizophrenic episode. Of course, people like to bash on about how "oh he'll end up in a mental ward instead of jail or death". Even when people are FUCKING DEAD as a result of this guy not being able to get any kind of mental health treatment, people still don't care. 



If there was more focus on treatment and not just "oh get over it/youll be fine" from parents, teachers, academics, etc, maybe those five people would be alive today. 



Sorry. It just hurts.

Depression takes control of everything, with claws as sharp as knives and a grip as strong as a tiger’s jaw. The world is grey and dull and you feel lifeless, like nothing will ever be okay or feel real ever again.





Depression is being bed ridden by misery, showering is rare and most often you find yourself sitting on the floor with the water so hot you feel like you’re skin is boiling, but you still feel frozen inside. 





Tears are rare, they used to flow freely and often but they have since dried, crying becomes unnatural because you don’t feel anything strongly enough to cry, you used to feel so overwhelmed with sadness you couldn’t breathe but now all you feel is empty and numb, emotions are all faked and you wonder if you will ever feel anything again. 





Shaking hands wrapped around yourself trying to feel secure in an embrace, but your own arms only make you feel more alone. 





Your heart feels like it’s missing, then it feels like it’s there and beating a hundred miles an hour and full of pain that spreads like poison through your veins, taking over your body until you can do nothing but stay in bed and stare at the tv, watching something that you’ve already seen but it doesn’t matter because you’re not really paying attention anyway, and that’s how your entire life feels, nothing matters because you can’t concentrate on anything and it’s all so painful that it feels like there isn’t a reason for anything, so you stay in bed and pull up the covers and leave the light off and the curtains closed.





Depression sucks away at your soul until you have nothing left. The things that once bought you joy are now just a chore, everything you love becomes dull and nothing cheers you up, except maybe getting drunk or bleeding yourself dry or taking so many drugs you forget that you were ever sad, but you never feel happy, just a bit less numb. 





The people around you don’t understand, because depression is not like sadness. Sadness is temporary and fleeting and it doesn’t dig in its claws, it doesn’t even have claws. Sadness can be replaced with music or movies or beautiful sights or friends, but depression turns those things into something else, and the joy they bring to most people vanishes.





 The people that love you try, but they can never relate, which makes it so hard. They tell you to just get up and do something that makes you happy, to just stop being miserable, to just socialize and have fun and be happy, but you can’t and you try and try and try but they just get fed up because you don’t improve, and it’s not their fault, but it’s not yours either. 





You have ghosts in your bedroom of all the people you loved that left, and you wonder why you’re not good enough, looking back on every moment and wondering what you did wrong, why doesn’t anybody love you, why this and why that and what if.





Your mind is a prison that you can’t escape and your bedroom walls become your home. Your heart feels heavy, sometimes you don’t even know if you have a heart at all. You feel so cold inside, like even the sun couldn’t warm you up. 

And you feel so, so terribly alone, because depression takes away your friends and loves and everyone else and no one understands the type of suffering you go through. 



I wouldn’t wish this upon anybody. I don't know how to cope with this anymore.

I mentally or physically can't do this work shit for the rest of my life. I have 0 motivation and don't give a shit about my life or my work. And the worst part? Everyone I told says "get over it that's life" No it's not life fuck off. I think dying may be the only escape from this.

My depression has the opposite effect on me, it makes me want to eat a lot every time I get sad. I've been obese my whole life and I fear I'm starting to get health problems because of that. I've tried to lose weight many times before but it's really hard to eat less and exercise when you don't have any energy or motivation at all... I wish I didn't want to eat. Is it weird?



EDIT: Forgot a word. Also, I know that not eating is as bad as over-eating, it's just that I am obese and if I could lose weight without trying it would be one thing less to worry about I guess

I titled it [The Taunt](http://i.imgur.com/opdDs00.png).



Hope and peace taunt those with depression.  They torture us by being so close yet always out of reach. And so you give up, and just sit there watching it from a distance, feeling mentally and physically incapable of obtaining it. You begin to deteriorate, staring at that flickering hope, and you watch everybody around you shake their heads and give up on you. This is what it feels like to be depressed, for me.



 I drew this when having one of those kinda days.

Heres some background...



I hate the feeling of greasy hair and everything else that comes with not showering for weeks on end.  I know rationally speaking nothing bad will happen if I shower.  I know there is no logical reason for me to not shower everyday.  But for some reason I hate it.  I simply dread it.  My 'reasoning' is that it is too much work, unnecessary, irritating and just plain stupid.





My psychologist told me once that it was fine if I did absolutely nothing all day, the only thing she asked me to do was brush my teeth and shower.  (She may have also said to walk for a few minutes outside and put on clean clothes but I decided to block that out.)





And I didn't get it until this week.  I just... I feel good.  It felt so good.  To wake up with clean hair, to not lift my arms and smell a stench from my pits.  In those few moments I loved it.



But of course now it is the second week and I still hate the idea of showering.  I'm annoyed at myself.  

Why can't I understand that it is a GOOD THING and why can't I make myself do it without all this inner struggle?

I hope this feeling of dread ends soon because I don't want to go back to showering once a week or once a month or even once every few months.  I don't want to spiral downward again, so soon after doing something positive.



Anyway, I thought maybe my little accomplishment might hit a note with even one of you.  If you'd like to talk about it more or talk about your problem with showering specifically I'll try as best as I can.

And I hope you wish me well with keeping up this habit.  I'm really going to try.





**EDIT:

Wow. I'm overwhelmed by the responses.  I'm so... happy (yes, happy!) that this really hit home with a lot of people.  That alone is huge.  When I'm in one of my lows, I know even reading and/or acknowledging stuff like this feels like bullshit.  

So if you showered because of this, GO YOU!  If you thought about showering because of this, GO YOU!  If you reflected on yourself in anyway, GO YOU! If you read this while on the toilet pooping, GO YOU!  All of you rock.  I mean it.  Keep chugging (like a train not a frat boy, hopefully) and take good care of yourselves.**

I can't function normally anymore. I don't want to eat, I don't want to sleep, I don't want to study. I want to stay at home all the times as a sort of an escapism. I watch porn just to stop thinking about her. And when I think about her, I just hurt myself more. I think about her beautiful pale skin, her dark hair, her melodious voice. I think about the possibility of someone touching her right now and it physically hurts.

I'm a really emotional person and I feel like my crushes really cross the level of a normal person's crush. I actually start to love them after a certain amount of time.

But I know I have no chance with her. I have no chance with any of them. I'm an ugly weirdo no one will ever love. So, there's to that.

I've been in love with my best friend for years (I'm a guy, she's a girl). We've hooked up and have a very open relationship but have always just stayed friends. I've never tried to pursue anything more because she's an incredibly happy, smart, and outgoing person. While I'm horribly depressed, anxious, and reclusive. 



I feel like a lot of girls who are happy are almost drawn to this. I've purposely manipulated every potential relationship with any girl because I know I'll ruin their life. I can't take care of myself. I'll just drag them down and they'll leave me eventually. It's too much. I'm too empty.



Anyone else feel this way? That if you get in a relationship you'll be a huge burden?



I just need to find someone who is as equally fucked up as me and we can lay in bed all day together.



Edit: Thanks for all the responses everyone. While it's shitty that so many people feel this way, it can be comforting and therapeutic to know that you're not alone. I would try and respond to all of you guys but i'm exhausted, you get it. Hope we can all find love someday.

Whenever depression gets worse for me, I often find myself remembering some time in my childhood in which I said or did something dumb or cringe-worthy. Followed by a wave of self-loathing. Not too much time passes before it happens again. Wash, rinse, and repeat.



I know it's irrational, irrelevant, and ridiculous to judge myself as if it had happened now. But it happens anyway, and it gets in the way of me just being myself as a 20 year old in college. Does this happen to anyone else?

I was taking a walk and had about 20 minutes of no cars or people. I started pretending like it was the zombie apocalypse and somehow it made me feel better. I came up with this list as I finished my walk.





Ten reasons why a zombie apocalypse would be awesome for depressed people:





1) You can shoot any zombie that ever told you pre-apocalypse to "cheer up" or "get over it."



2) Your feelings of isolation and being alone are even more valid. 



3) No more expensive psych meds - pillage all pharmacies.



4) Staying in bed four days in a row is a good idea and potentially life saving.



5) Fewer awkward social interactions. Possibly no social interactions.



6) Zombies far less judgmental than real people.



7) Forever alone doesn't feel like your fault anymore.



8) Fewer options and need to re-populate possibly means never alone again.



9) "Normal" survivors might finally experience clinical depression and understand.



10) If you really, really hate it, you can always become a zombie.

I just finished taking a shower. I'm wearing clean, comfy clothes and my socks feel heavenly on my feet. My face is clean so I'm not wearing makeup from yesterday. I put on deodorant and am about to brush my teeth and finish my hair. 



This is my hour of therapy. No talking to anyone else, no meds, just washing off yesterdays dirt. It feels fucking good!

I've constant anxiety that if I mention one word of how I feel its gonna be taken as attention seeking behavior. When it couldn't be more less true. I've seen the fake tears some people pour out, the over dramatics they display. It makes me sick and I want to scream at them how much harder they are making it for people with a actual problem. Is there anyway to talk to a friend or family and not have to fear this?

Seeing all the lights, Christmas themed things, I just want to escape all of that but you can't. It's everywhere you go. The adverts on the TV hardly help (thank god I hardly watch television) and It seems to make my state worse.



What's saddening is that I'm getting anxious as Christmas approaches. I know I'm going to be sad on a day that many, many people will be happy on. Friends are getting into the spirit and I can't. It's a perpetual cycle that just further reinforces how sad and depressed I am.



Maybe it's just me. Christmas means different things for different people. For me, I'd just like to belong.



Edit: I did not expect such an overwhelming response, thank you.

Perhaps I get too emotionally invested (I can't even watch emotional movies because I just can't stop thinking about them all day) in the news and the world, but sometimes I feel like non-depressed people are just good at being distracted. Ignorance is bliss, right? I feel like some people can easily shut off the problems of the world and feel hopeful still, and others can't and they are depressed. But really, when the odds of "things working out" (for our futures and the worlds) are statistically against you... Unless you are really good at distracting yourself, how can you actually feel positive deep down?



I don't know. I am able to distract myself most of the time, but I am never unaware that I am simply giving in to distraction (which makes it hard to fully enjoy oneself).

I was wondering if anyone here has been accused of using depression as an excuse - I've been informed that I have a bad habit of either blaming my poor communication choices on depression or if I blame my poor communication choices on my depression and use it as a justification in my head...



This has got me stumped to be honest and my head is spinning. My friend in question has no filter and generally says what she is thinking and can be a hard person. 



This was in response to me expressing my feelings (which are pretty irrational at the moment) which made her feel bad.



Anyone?

Reilly's parents were so close with her. They soothe her when she's upset. They encourage instead of coerce her into doing things. She can talk about her feelings and be accepted.



I wish my parents were like that.

Yesterday I was admitted to a group home for depression.  It may not sound like much, but for me, it's my salvation!  I'm not at the homeless shelter anymore (not a fun place with mental illness)!  I have help, they have nurses and med management, and best of all, food!  I still have a serious challenge ahead of me, but now I have help, I don't have to labor in solitude.  Yes I'm still depressed, still suicidal, but today, I'm something new, too; im hopeful

I generally have these type of mood swings where I care about something and feel good and then feel terrible and don't care too much about anything. I've built up quite a nice wardrobe that I haven't worn because I don't care too much to look good. Anyone else?

I just wanted to say something positive, since I've been so lonely and depressed lately.... I made friends last night! How you might say? Well, I love the sport of hockey, and live here in LA I expected not to meet any hockey fans..



 still getting use to living here after graduating from college in New England....  UVM Grad! 



so I made a group on Meet Up group if anyone was interested in coming over to my apartment for booze/food and the game between LA and Anaheim.  Low and behold 6 people responded and actually showed up! (5 dudes, 1 girl ) 



 I was so anxious, and I felt so incredibly awkward at first, but then I let down my guard :D they are a great group of people like me, and I feel blessed to have made friends with them :) GO KINGS GO!

My emotions have run me dry and I am now numb. I feel like this is the denial process of grief. I can't accept it. He was 63, and I lived with him for 5 years as his caretaker. All the other times he was ill or mistakenly taken too much of a particular medicine I saved him. Every time he fell, I picked him up. I fixed his medicine every week and cooked him a meal at least three times a week depending on my work schedule. My brother and I loved to watch wrestling with him. Every PPV, we ordered pizza and enjoyed the show. He was the biggest factor in my decision to join the Army because of his proud service in Vietnam. In fact I bought replacement medals for him that he lost over the years for Christmas. I wanted to see his face when I presented him his medals, especially his Bronze Star which he always mentioned first when asked about his medals. Now he will never see them.



I thought I was prepared for this. He certainly prepared, by prepaying his funeral expenses in 2012 without me knowing, setting a will in that year as well, telling me what to do when he passed, which I really hated because I just didn't want to talk death with my dad. But now here I am, along with my brother, faced with reality. It wasn't supposed to happen like this...I wasn't supposed to find you on the floor so stiff I couldn't perform CPR. I only wish I stayed up last night with you to make sure everything was okay, like I always did. I wanted you to see my brother graduating from college, our weddings, your grandchildren. My eyes are so raw from rubbing them today. My tears just aren't producing anymore. I want to cry, but I can't.



I miss you dad. Love you so much.

I'm in college, and my major requires me to do tons of outside work. It's not homework, but it's very required. I don't want to give away my identity, or I'd better explain what I mean. Anyways, I just don't want to do any of it. I can't make myself do it. Pretty soon, the end of the semester is gonna be here, and I'm gonna be screwed because I haven't been doing what I need to. It's not laziness, it's not procrastination. I just can't bring myself to do it. It would be nice to talk to someone else that really suffers from this particular symptom.



Also, does anyone else here have dysthymia, rather than depression?

Regardless of if it's today, next week, next year, or in 10 years, I feel certain that suicide is how I'll go.  It doesn't matter how long I hold on for, eventually I won't be able to keep fighting.  It's only a matter of time.

Is this common for anyone else? Or vice versa for girls? 



I just know I will never talk to them or have any connection with them. I also started a new job recently and I hate hearing everyone talk about their significant other while I have no one. It seems like such a trivial thing to be sad over but I just want some affection.

I am a twenty-four year old male and I am a non-offending pedophile. I'm so nervous about sharing these sentiments that I had to preemptively write and carefully edit the following words so while the following paragraphs possess a deliberate or wordy tone, please believe that what I have to share and ask is completely earnest (as much as a part of me wants to lie and say that it isn't). Please bear with me; there's quite a lot to unload.



[the following paragraph recounts a traumatic incident of sexual abuse and might be too disturbing for some readers]



When I was eight or nine years old, I was molested by a stranger at a public restroom. I was at a urinal when I was tapped on the shoulder by a man behind me. He proceeded to wrap his arms around me and reach over to my unzipped crotch area. Being the naïve child I was, I figured that he was just trying to zip up my pants but then he started to fondle me with his fingers while whispering “Let me touch it…” into my ears. I broke free of his grasp but not before he brushed his fingertips against my penis.



The situation obviously could have been worse. There was no penetration, no groping, no oral contact, no serious physical harm – but it was still molestation, and I believe that it affected me. It affected me to the point where I would remind myself of the incident every single following day of my life. It affected me to the point where I would sometimes lie in bed and lose sleep thinking about that man and his cold, invasive touch. It affected me to the point where I experienced a serious and noticeable personality change; one that my mother would remark about but was never be able to decipher.



I suppose that it seems ridiculous to other victims out there that my reaction would be this strong, especially considering the mild nature of the molestation, but a lot of my issues are perhaps attributable to the fact that I had never told a soul that I had been molested. I never spoke to my parents about it, never spoke to authorities about it, never spoke to peers about it, never spoke to teachers about it; I’ve just kept the memory bottled in my conscience throughout my adolescence and young adulthood. You readers are my very first audience.



It’s hard to say why I never had the courage to speak to anyone about it. Perhaps it was the fact that the confrontation happened on a family trip and I didn’t want to ruin the occasion; perhaps it was the fact that I could not handle the guilt of having not immediately speaking to a grown up about what happened. Regardless, it has been so long since it happened that this post is as good as fiction. I have no evidence and no recollection of the appearance of the molester in question. All that remains is a dreary, skeletal but nonetheless sad memory. I continue to have many nightmarish ideas about how many other children I could have saved from molestation had I actually done something.



It is hard to properly articulate the confrontation’s full emotional toll, especially considering how I have always had behavioural and social difficulties, but I would perhaps associate the memory with my sexual insecurity and confusion. Even though I am well into my twenties, I have never kissed a girl (or boy). I had only started masturbating at the age of seventeen or eighteen since the thought of stimuli had long seemed perverse to me. Even the idea of flirting or approaching girls is a scary one for reasons I can barely articulate. I can try to go into further details or analysis but I suppose that I’m just dancing around the point of this post.



During my mid-teens, I began to develop a peculiar fascination towards young adolescent males that has remained with me to this day. Sometimes it would be as slight as me turning my head towards a young patron at the pharmacy I work at, but other times (particularly during my high-school years and my Scouting years) it would turn into a full-out crush where I would ponder about a particular kid obsessively, with the child in question usually being between 10 and 15 years of age. It’s not a conventional primal attraction but there’s definitely a sexual component to this attraction. I won’t go into detail but beyond the immediate lure that a handsome boy has over me, I also experience fantasies. And while these fantasies aren’t necessarily man-boy they are often boy-boy, boy-girl, or boy-woman. I suppose that I adore the concept of young sexual discovery; something that I’ve never been able to experience myself. While that many sound mildly innocent, these pederastic tendencies have exacerbated to the point where I actively seek out yaoi-imagery of underage males and to the point where I have to incorporate boys into my thoughts before I climax. I feel greatly humiliated even discussing this but as ashamed as I am, there are few places for me to turn to.



My fondness for boys is not solely erotic, and this is partly what scares me. I get along great with kids; probably better than I do with people my own age. It’s not just direct interaction that warms me; even loitering on the train nearby seventh or eighth graders as they’re returning from school brings me a sort of quiet joy. I suppose that this is where pedophiles who lack self-awareness get into trouble: they seek out environments and workplaces where they have more contact with kids and then proceed to evade boundaries. As much I’d like to think that I am beyond that, I am worried about…well, not being worried anymore. I might devolve to a point where I convince myself that what I’m feeling is normal.



So why make an anonymous confession now? Well, because my life is currently going to shit for a number of reasons (that’s a post for another time) and dealing with such matters has been a tremendous mental burden. This is the sort of depression that I suppose many twenty-something-year-olds feel as they look forward and regret the past but if I want to move on, this titular personal flaw needs to be fixed. The dilemma, however, is that I don’t know how to fix it. If I can forget my attraction to boys and/or accept and tame it, that would be a true emotional triumph.



**Tl;dr** My pedophilia, whether legit or paranoia, needs to be addressed but I don’t know the safe means of seeking help. My father’s loathing of me and my mother’s irrationality makes them hard to approach and I fear that therapists would lack understanding or worse, regard me as a danger (again, I have never harmed a child and have never possessed or partaken in child porn). Schooling is coming to an end and I’ll have to move out and seek fulltime employment rather soon and the idea of further isolating myself before having my feelings confronted is frightening. It’s very recently come to the point where taking my own life would be a more preferable option to dealing with the possible monster I am. What should I do?



Thank you for your time.



PS: As a side note, /r/confession would have been a more suitable subreddit but after having PM'ed one of their moderators without receiving a reply in return, I felt too scared to share my story there. I hope that this post is not too inappropriate for /r/depression.



EDIT: Just want to say that this reception has been utterly alleviating. There probably wasn't a better and more understanding group for me to turn to, so thank you all very much.



EDIT2: This thread is obviously dead but for the curious ones who are reading this post-mortem, I have taken the thread's advice and have been seeing a private therapist regularly for the last few weeks. I waited until the third session to discuss my pedophilic sentiments and while he was patient and understanding (albeit noticeably uncomfortable), he admitted that these matters were out of his domain and referred me to a professor who specializes in "sexual delinquency". If and when I visit the second professional, I'll be sure to provide an update about my progress. Just know that while I was a nervous wreck when discussing my molestation and paraphilia with another person, it was not nearly as scary or regrettable as one would expect. I recommend anyone in my position to do the same and seek support, no matter what his or her anxieties are. There's more help out there than you might think.

(Edit made: October 11th)



EDIT: Here's one last update. I've been regularly seeing that new therapist who specializes in sex offenders and men with sexual dysfunctions and have been going to sessions with him for about two months now. Long story short, it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I've found a psychiatrist with whom I feel comfortable enough to discuss not just my pedophilia but also my concerns regarding school, work, family, depression, and how all these factors come into play. It was with his help that I came to the decision to continue my schooling and seek a new career path, and now we're taking steps in figuring out how to seek out adult relationships. I owe him (and the people who got me into contact with him) quite a lot but none of this would have possible without this thread. Thank you all so much for giving me a rare happy ending.

(Edit made: December 22nd)

I am slipping back into depression lately after years of finally feeling "better" somehow. The current state of the world with all these shootings, terrorist attacks, police brutality, islamaphobia, homophobia, racism. It's like everywhere I look there's just hate and I can't escape it. Friends, family, coworkers. And of the people I do know who aren't full of hate it seems like all they do is watch reality tv and stay glued to their phones.They all talk about bullshit celebrity gossip while the world seems to be falling apart.Front page today says antibiotic resistant bacteria is becoming more of a problem and could start killing us all within the next few years. Kylie Jenner called her sister fat. The old man at my work tells me how 3rd world countries should murder all their poor people so that only the rich are left and they won't have to deal with poor freeloaders anymore. Charlie Sheen might have HIV. 30 Nigerians killed in a suicide bomb blast... how come no one ever talks about them on facebook? It's just... overwhelming. For the longest time I tried... I tried to just ignore media. Ignore facebook. If it just makes me depressed then don't watch the news right? But it doesn't change anything. It's all still there. I have a job where every day I have to plaster this stupid fucking smile on my face and bullshit with strangers and coworkers about sports that I don't fucking care about, or who did what on the red carpet of some awards show, or what night club is hot right now that they should check out when they leave? And don't get me wrong I do love my job and I love people and meeting them and talking to them but it's just so hard lately when all I can think about is how many fucking people are gonna die in a drone strike today? In a suicide blast? In a school shooting? Shot by a cop? Cops shot by people pissed about cops shooting people? How many people are going to starve? Die from some unimaginably horrible disease? Get hit by a drunk driver? The place I work is actually a place that would make sense as a terror target, and our security kinda sucks. I have nightmares about shit happening there. All I want in life is some modicum of peace. I just want to see people not hurt each other so much, all the fucking time. So it's a bit hard when that's all I can think about, to put on that stupid smile, and talk about the game, or the new tux you just bought, or what music festival is coming up.CAN'T YOU FUCKING SEE PEOPLE ARE DYING!? CAN'T YOU SEE PEOPLE NEED YOUR HELP!? YOUR CHEERING FOR A BOMBING CAMPAIGN THAT JUST TOOK OUT HUNDREDS OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS! DON'T YOU REALIZE THEY'RE PEOPLE TOO!? WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING!? ... why am I not helping?  I just ... I don't know what the fuck to do. When the world is the way it is it feels like doing anything is fucking pointless.It feels like I don't want to exist here. But if I die then I can't help. But how can I possibly help? It all just feels fucked. But I'll put on that smile. And I'll say Hi folks! What can I get for you tonight? And we'll bullshit about the game. And you'll tell me how "Katelyn Jenner winning an espy was bullshit, people think they can get away with anything these days", and in the back round I'll see the quick shot of bodies laying in the street next to a bombed marketplace. And no one will care, and I'll ask if I can get you a refill?

Just wanted to share with someone since this is an important anniversary for me.



Apparently out of the hundreds of suicidal patients he's seen, I was only the third he thought would actually be dead soon. Since then I've had several more suicide attempts and 5 more hospital admissions, but I am still here. I sort of thought today would feel more significant than it does. I still struggle. I still have suicidal thoughts. I'm stable, though, and I've ruled out suicide as an option. It's harder that way, but I owe it to my family and friends to stay here, and the world is too interesting to leave it so soon.



I'm glad I'm still here.

That's it really. Even on good days, I still feel like shit. Nothing is ever different. Nothing is ever better.



My entire existence is just a series of moments where I feel like shit, followed by moments where I'm too distracted to notice that I feel like shit.



The only time I ever feel okay is when I'm distracted. Video games, movies, whatever. But as soon as it stops, I feel awful again.



Fuck. That.



What is the point in continuing to suffer? Tomorrow isn't going to be any better, and neither is the day after that. I have years and years of evidence that shows tomorrow is going to be just as shitty as today.



Nothing is going to get better. What the fuck am I still doing here?

I catch myself doing this A LOT to the point where I half expect a portal to the past to open right in front of me. The littlest things will get me thinking on how differently i could've done things to lead my life on a better path. I usually daydream about my mistakes and how i couldve done them differently all day which i know isn't healthy at all. I just don't know how to think about anything else at this point...

the thing about depression is that it takes over your entire life; it never leaves you alone. everything you do, think about, feel, depression is always lurking around the corner. you stop getting hungry anymore and everything you try to eat tastes bland and terrible, or you can’t stop eating and you know you’re overeating but you just can’t stop. you’re up all night with bags under your eyes or you sleep for 17 hours a day. you begin to feel like your only escape is through dreaming, that is until you stop dreaming all together. the dishes start to pile up beside your bed and all over your room, the laundry is so far behind you can’t even see the bottom. you can’t remember the last time you took a shower or brushed your teeth or washed your face. you stop talking to all of your friends because you stop caring and you figure they hate you anyways. your grades drop, you fail test after test, and you just don’t care. you lay in bed all day while your thoughts either eat you alive or leave your brain empty. then the numbness starts to set in. you stop feeling anything at all. you no longer feel happy, sad, excited, scared, hopeful, anything. even physical pain doesn’t bother you anymore. you notice yourself changing. you are nothing like the person you used to be, the person everyone knew and loved. you wish you could get your old self back but it seems like that person is buried under hundreds of thousands of layers of cement. your body begins to feel heavy. getting out of bed becomes the hardest task you will have to face. you snap at your loved ones, pushing them away because even though they are trying to help they will never understand. your thoughts drift off until you forget you are even in your own body, that you are even alive or even human. you certainly don’t feel like any of those things.



the thing about depression is that it isn’t just crying yourself to sleep once or twice. it takes over your body, your being, your life, and your soul. it feels like you are being sucked into a black hole and drowning underwater for months, years. it consumes you.

I have been committed to getting myself into better shape, so I take a walk on my lunch hour at work. Nothing too strenuous, but it's exercise at least.



Yesterday, the tears kept coming - I had to make multiple trips to the bathroom to avoid awkward conversations with my coworkers. And as I walked through the lobby of our building, it was so tempting to retreat to my car and hide for the next hour - crying and sleeping.



But I didn't do it. I walked out into a mild rainstorm and did my usual hike around the block, tears streaming down my face. I didn't let myself retreat further, and I didn't hide. Even though my pace was slower than usual, I still did it, and I had enough time to meditate for 10 minutes.



I'm still crying, I still hurt, but I am doing my best to make conscious decisions that are good and healthy for me in spite of all of that.

My psychiatrist told me that I no longer meet the criteria for major depressive disorder! Our relationship has been terminated. OFFICIALLY. (Though I will carry on with therapy.) Off all meds! Feeling pretty revitalized. 



Thank you, r/depression, for all of your support.

Just less than two years ago, I left university on medical grounds after a suicide attempt.



These days, I have a degree in mathematics and have just been offered a job at triple the salary I currently work at (I earn peanuts at the moment).



It has been a very difficult two years, but I have never given up no matter how low I got and it has paid off. Yay!



All those thoughts in my head of being completely useless, I will not and have not let you take over me. 



Stay strong /r/depression,  we can all do this :-)

I'm severely depressed and it's effecting my life in crippling ways; It makes it nearly impossible for me to go to college because the pressure I face there gives me panic attacks and when I am there I feel unsafe and anti-social. To make things worse, the fact that I miss college piles guilt on me and makes everything a thousand times worse. I want to be in lessons, I really do but I just can't face it. 



When I'm off college, I just sit there and cry at home. Or try to take my mind off of it before something knocks me right back down again. But people, even my teachers, think I'm just skipping lessons or lazy and I'm sick of it. I'm ill but people don't see that because I'm not bleeding or physically broken. They tell me to "suck it up" and just force myself to go to college. But I can't, if I force myself then i'll hurt myself. 



The only time I'm happy outside is at my martial arts class, which I feel perfectly happy going it, but this doesn't help the fact people think I'm just bunking off college. "If you're well enough to go play sport then you're well enough for lessons." The teachers don't understand that it doesn't work like that. 



I just tell them I'm throwing up when I don't turn up because I'm too scared to explain myself and be laughed at and told off. I have just as much right to remove myself from lessons if it's hurting me then someone with a broken arm does. I'm hurt too. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. 



Does anyone else have experiences like this?

Fuck you if you categorize all suicides like this. This isn't depression over a relationship breakup, monetary problems or grief over a loss. I've had severe treatment-resistant depression for 30 years now. I've been through countless antidepressants, multiple mood stablizers, TMS, and the shrooms and ketamine I've recently ordered from the dark web. Yet I still am chronically depressed and go to bed every day wishing I won't wake up. I live off disability and my mom takes care of me. This is not fucking temporary. It is permanent. "Oh continue living because in 20-40 more years there might be a new pill will be developed that will alleivate your depression!."



When you have a problem **the permanent solution is always the best.** You don't seek to temporarily fix a problem. You seek to permanently fix it.



This is why this fucking useless platitude and the cunts who espouse it en masse boil my blood.



If you have gambled at a casino for 30 years and lost every time, it's perfectly rational and acceptable to quit. Enough becomes enough.

I struggle with this idea a lot.  I'm not sure what I want in my life. I'm a year away from finishing a business degree and am fairly well set up to get a decent paying job once I graduate. But I am not passionate about the work I do and it makes going to work unbearable. 



I keep telling myself that I need to find something I am passionate about for me to not feel so lost all the time, but I have so many things I am kind of interested in but nothing that I truly feel passionate about. I thought I had more to say, but I'm sure some of you know how that goes...

I will never tell anyone how I feel, it is not something I can see myself doing. My insecurities are growing higher then ever so that means everything I feel stays in. I know I'm starting to slip into that feeling again, the one we are all familiar with, only this time I feel like I am gonna be trapped in it for longer. Some of us weren't meant to live a good life, it's the way the universe balances itself out. I apologize for this kinda post, it defiantly isn't helping anyone, the negativity shouldn't spread like that but I felt I needed to let it out abit. I feel wierd posting this and I hope it just slips through the cracks because frankly I feel wierd even doing something like this, I cant post this  I should be getting some sleep I have early classes tommorow. 



Shout out to those who feel like everytime they try they end up in a worse place then before



shoutout to those who had their self confidence crushed over the years



shoutout to those who feel like crying for no reason right now



shoutout to everyone feeling depressed in any way shape or form, can't exlude anyone in this



can't wait to wake up tommorow and hate myself. Well thats enough ranting right now, this shit prob is confusing as fuck right now I hope it is somewhat legible. im nervous to post this. im not very smart so maybe this is just a bunch of unconnected sentances. take care ya'll,

I've had people tell me i was depressed because i had time to be depressed and that i should find something useful to do. That i am in this way because I want to. 

Why can't they understand.

i wonder whether my current state of mind is because i'm doing so inconceivably poorly in school. i finish school next year, i constantly wish something would happen so i don't have to live til graduation in spring of 2014. i wish i could disappear, or never have existed, or something, anything, so i don't have to confess this to my parents. i feel so horribly about the annual $57,000 tuition they pay, only to have me squander away my days in college feeling hopeless and utterly unproductive. i've dropped more than eight classes, i have a D on my transcript...i don't want a future anymore. i dont want to find a fucking internship, i don't want to go to grad school, i don't want to confront the reality that i've fucked up so badly that there's no chance i'll find gainful employment in the near future.



how many of you feel depressed due to academic failures? 

is it still depression if you feel the solution to all your problems would be a clean slate from first year?

"Are you okay?"



"Hmm? Oh, yeah. I'm just tired."



It's the easiest excuse to use and the most believed one, too. 



It's true though too, on some level. You are tired. Tired of feeling bad. Tired of feeling lost. And lonely. And upset. And sad. And crazy. Tired of over-thinking and under-analyzing. Tired of losing yourself amidst the lies. Tired from sleeping too much or not at all. Tired of worrying. And fretting. And putting your life on hold because you can't just 'get over it'. Tired of pretending. Tired of hiding. 



It's alright.    

I'm just tired.

I told him he wouldn't have to deal with my shit anymore if I was dead. He instantly broke down in tears and started to beg me to stay alive. I kept telling him I'm worthless, stupid, and have no meaning to be here. He went full on insane and I couldn't even recognize his voice. I felt so uncomfortable and told him to cut the act. He told me he wasn't acting and that I mean the world to him. I asked how? I've done nothing great in my life. He has a daughter who is a nobody. He said the proudest day of his life was when we were at a restaurant and a waiter spilled a cup of water on the floor and some of the water got on me but I helped the waiter clean up and wasn't mad and laughed about it. I went to the bathroom and the waiter said I was a good person. I don't remember this happening to me.



On Monday, I am going to a psychiatric hospital to get help. I don't think it will work but I have to try. My depression tells me I deserve to be dead. But a little voice in my head is telling me one day I can be truly happy.

Well I overdosed on sunday with the absolute intent of dying....turns out I didn't and was taken to hospital. Anyway, the suicide note I had scheduled to be released 3 days later and later thought I cancelled (so my parents didn't have to do it) did not actually cancel.





So then I had people calling, messaging, posting and texting. And it was a fucking *BLESSING!!!* never in my life have I felt my friends cared for me so much as in that moment.





Now I am not a vaguebooker which is why I got this response and I don't suggest you try it at home but for me I have reconnected with years old friends and actually feel like maybe I could try treatment instead of killing myself.

I just have no motivation. My life is filled up with reddit, youtube, jerking off, cutting, and trying to move past being so bad. I haven't even showered yet and it's 7PM.



I don't think I've showered before 6PM on a weekend in years.



Edit: oh yeah, and I haven't brushed my teeth all weekend. Actually, I haven't showered all weekend.

I took a week off. Not once did anyone ask me how I was, or if I wanted to do anything. I did get a text asking me to come in.



I realized how little people actually care about me.



I saw a shooting star this morning. Hopefully my wish can come true.

I'm in a very weird position right now, and I really need to vent. Because I haven't been able to get out of bed for the past few days. You don't have to read this story (its long), but I really just need to let this out.



So, to preface this, I am in college right now, and every year since I was young I have been going to the middle east, and spending time with my family over the summer. Last summer I met a girl, who I connected with more than anybody I had ever met. As an anti-social, frankly ugly person I had never been great with women, never had a girlfriend, or a friend who is a girl. 



But this girl was beautiful and funny, not that smart but amazing. Really amazing. I spent the entire rest of my vacation with her. She was my very first girlfriend, my first kiss, my first lover. But, I had school so I had to leave, I spent one last night with her and promised to keep in touch. And I did. 



Everyday after classes I'd send her a message on WhatsApp and ask her how she was. She meant so much to me, and I felt like I wasn't worthy, so I started working out, tried to improve my Arabic, and took care of myself for once. She pushed me the entire way, talking with me on Skype and really making me better. I believed she was an angel sent to save my life, and in many ways she was. 



But a week ago, she stopped responding to my messages. I thought she had gotten bored of me, I thought the worst. And then the worst happened.



I offhandedly asked my relative in Lebanon what had happened to her. She sighed and sadly told me that she had moved away. I knew she was lying from the tone of her voice and pressed it. Which now I regret... a whole lot. 



She told me that this girl, my first motivation and first love had been murdered. She had been raped and killed, and found dead in an alley. I was so horrified I closed the phone and began to cry. I went to bed, crying. slept for 3 hours and woke up soaked in my own tears. Then I stayed in bed and haven't gone to my classes since. I've laid in bed not talking to anyone and I feel like I'm dying slowly. 



Even now I'm crying, feeling empty inside. Feeling like my heart is shuddering with every breath. I have a constant sense of despair in my stomach. And I keep sending her messages hoping that this is some sort of cruel joke on my relatives part. My parents have come by and tried to comfort me but have given up. My best friend has tried to console me but he isn't the touchy feely type to  begin with. I don't know why I wrote this, but I really need to vent, to get this out of my head before I go back to school tommorow. 



I'm sorry for the novel, thanks for reading if you got this far. 



 Edit: I really am overwhelmed by everything everyone is saying. I'm reading every comment and I hear everything everyone is saying, even if I don't reply thank you.

"It's no problem at all. You are such a great person 99% of the time, that the 1% when you are down is easy to deal with because I know that the real you will be back very soon. *'If you can't deal with someone at their worst, then you don't deserve them at their best.'* -Quote from your favourite person."

For all of you feeling like it will never get better: I've been there.  But as you move forward, you will eventually find people who understand you and love you unconditionally. Even if there are only a few, those people (and animals!) are so very worth sticking around for.

If you really want to say something to try and make me feel better, don't just spit out the world's most general comment. Please. It didn't help the first time I heard it, it's not going to help the 12th time either.



Edit: I've made my way through all the comments, and I have to say thank you to everyone who replied. It's nice to actually feel understood.

Horrible as it may seem, I mostly do this when people don't seem to be demonstrating that they care about me, even though I know they somehow do. It's like I can't just believe that people care about me or that they would react if something did happen to me- I wish I could see how they would react to something as horrible as me dying just to be reassured that I do mean something to them.



Or I may just be evil and vindictive. It may just be that I hate that I don't matter enough to them, that they don't spend enough time with me or thinking about me, and that I want to haunt them because I feel as if it would serve them right for not including me in things. It's childish, really.



I don't blame you if you respond saying that I'm selfish and that I should go to hell. But I guess I needed to somehow get the idea out of my system.



*UPDATE:....You guys really are the best.

This is exactly how I feel I died a few years ago but I won't be buried for another 50. I wish one of my friends or family understood how I feel. But they just brush it off. Forget about it like it was just a bad day and im back to normal, but this is my normal.

I'm lost for words, this is exactly what I need, it's only a 10 hour contract, but there's room for more shifts as and when, and to be completely honest, that's perfect for me!  Having recently been declared unfit for work, this is the best way for me to get back into it, and well, today is a pretty awesome day as opposed to the shit I felt like when I woke up.



This, just, yeah!



Ive been job hunting since september, now I can finally stop selling all of my music equipment just to put food on the table!

It's almost like I feel it's contagious. Like my best friend has severe depression so she understands what it's like. But when I'm down I feel like it's rude to talk to her about it because she's dealing with it herself and who wants to be reminded of that? Like the only time I want to hear or talk about depression is when I'm sick.



This goes double for my girl friend. She wants to comfort me and see me better and opening up to her does help. But I'm so logical and break everything down to be analyzed so much that I feel like as I'm talking to her I'm helping her see the things I'm depressed about and then it brings her down some too.



So, TLDR: does anyone not share they're feelings like you think it's contagious?



Edit: front page! Hooray depression!

I some times look happy. I'll smile and laugh and even joke. But it's fake; it's my mask that I put on to hide the fact that I'm no longer that "super happy, super sweet" girl any more. I don't want to let any one know that I was weak enough to let depression crash over me and ruin my life.



I've realised that my general personality is no longer "Always happy, but some times a tiny sad". It's now "Always sad, but some times a tiny bit happy".





No one knows, though. They don't know that as soon as I turn away from their watchful faces, my mask slips and the broken, fragile person shows through. 





I'm sick of feeling hurt, and empty, and lonely. 





And I'm sick of hiding it, and holding it all inside where its just festering away at me.

When I'm asleep, I forget who I am.  Those first few seconds of bliss when I wake up, look at my girlfriend, and smile.



Then I look around me and realize it's just another day of this.  I remember why I'm depressed.  I remember the crawl.  I wake up, go on my computer all day, and smoke weed all day.



I can't remember the past two months.

Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just making up the entire thing. Whenever I find myself enjoying something and being happy, I just end up thinking, am I really depressed? I'll look at people describing what depression feels like, find something I don't relate to, and immediately start doubting myself. Some people's depression seems to be much worse than mine, and it makes me feel like a fraud to be putting myself on the same level as them. It's like there's a "blueprint" for what a depressed person should feel and act like and if I can't fit perfectly into it, I'm not truly depressed, or I'm not depressed enough and shouldn't be complaining. Depression is like swimming against the current of a river, and whenever I find the occasional rock to hold onto or the current eases up, and I see others being sucked under, I start to doubt whether or not I should bother trying to pull myself out, or if I'm even in the river at all. 



This probably doesn't make sense, but it's been bothering me for a long time.



Edit: Thanks for the comments, they made me feel a lot better and I don't feel as alone knowing others feel the same. I have been diagnosed and I'm getting help (on medication, seeing therapist soon). This sub has been, and continues to be a tremendous help. So thank you all for the support, and good luck to those also struggling.

Made me remember how easily someone can make a rather gloomy day a bit less so.



I'll be sure to return the favor to someone :)

I'm not depressed anymore. I used to read all the titles and totally feel correlated to everything people were feeling. But those feelings have waned in the past couple months, and i'm glad to say I just don't relate to the posts here now. Goodbye guys. Thanks for helping me through a tough time.

On my old account earlier someone used a post I made on /r/suicidewatch to humiliate me in argument here on Reddit.



I feel so violated. I'm such an idiot why didn't I just use a throwaway?  I'm so stupid. 



I hate myself. I'm very mentally unstable and that threw my completely off today. I completely lost it and exploded when he did this. 



I'm just done. There's no point in even trying to get help

i can't believe tomorrow I'll be a year older. A year ago things were so different. I was going to make something of myself, I was going to be someone. I was going to change the world and be a good person, and now when I look in the mirror all I see is a selfish coward who's accomplished nothing and lost everything in a span of a year.



I don't know how much more I can take, what's the point of fighting if you've got nothing to fight for? No dreams, no goals, no talents, no future, no friends, just nothing. My birthday each year is just a reminder of how little all the people around me care. Even my dad forgot my birthday. It would be just so fucking poetic if I just fucking died tomorrow, on the day life started for me all those years ago. Makes me laugh thinking about it, it would be something straight out of a Sylvia Plath poem.

You want to talk to someone but you're brain won't let you. 



You finally manage to talk to someone but then they get upset and you feel shitty again for making them upset. Like "no don't be sad, it's not that I want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist."



You need to eat but you haven't eaten so you're brain can't think of what to eat so you don't eat.



You haven't showered in three days but you've been in bed until 5pm so you might as well just wait till tomorrow. You're not going to shower tomorrow. Fuck all this noise. 



You go on social media. Everyone's a cunt. You feel bad again. 



I feel shitty again for wasting you're time with this rant. Sorry. 





EDIT: Thank you r/depression for providing a place to post all this stuff. Also, to anyone who takes the time to comment. Thank You! It means a lot when there isn't anyone close by to talk to.

*Sigh* I'm pretty irritated as you can imagine, but being depressed for a long time has prepared myself to be let down by people. I just wanted to talk no harmful intentions. Felt lonely and wanted to hear another human being's voice.

Just like the title says, I worked up the energy to go get my hair cut and clean out all of the rotting food, bottles and school papers I was hiding from my parents out from under my bed. The haircut mad me look a little more human and cleaning the crap out from under my bed got rid of the horrible smell in my room and lifted a huge burden off of my mind. Just thought I'd share.

Perhaps not directly, browsing this subreddit has influenced my life enough that I feel grateful to have been a part of it. Just knowing that there are others out there who understand my pain have been immensely important in supporting me, making me feel less alone, to allow me to get to my current position. 



Unfortunately, in some ways, this relief means I can no longer understand your pain. It's upsetting for me at times, to know that my depression, something that brought me and my best friend closer through our mutual understanding, is gone. I still love my best friend but now that part of our relationship is gone and I truly can only help by being there for him. I won't pretend to understand, like I could before, what he's going through because I'm not going through it anymore and I respect him enough not to lie to him. In a way I do understand that it's a difficult part of life, one that can force us right to the edge. I've attempted suicide before, I've instantly regretted it. 



My depression, now I've come to understand it so fully that I could rid myself of it (that old feeling, the awareness that my depression was stupid, is gone, it makes complete sense to me) looks like chronic stress, where stress brings about the emotional responses of guilt and/or fear. Now, I still have many symptoms of borderline personality disorder that are easily exacerbated by stress (awareness of my triggers is helping ease this, even when the triggers are present, they are less effective if I'm aware of them now) and I'm getting help, I feel hopeful, like I could get out of this mess I'm, make this mess I am into me. 



I won't keep going into my own depression though because I understand (and still agree) that depression is depressing. 



Safe to say now that this has been the best year of my life so far, I've been through a lot of shit and come out of it by finishing my first year of uni, making the best friends I've ever had and getting myself the help I need to move on with my life and be a better person instead of having, what most people would  interpret as, a negative attitude and taking responsibility for the things I can change and accepting the things I can't. I've struggled alone for years because of low self-esteem making me believe I wasn't able to improve or I wasn't worth improving. 



Perhaps I just got lucky, I just waited and kept going through life until good things happened enough for me to get myself out of this kind of life because it was obviously not working for me. Perhaps I'll never know. But I do care, and I'm trying to understand best I can, what it is that society has labelled as wrong with you, and make you feel better. Thanks again for the support, it helped. Feel free to PM me, I may lurk occasionally, goodbye!

It's hard admitting that I've thought of jumping off this bridge before, and I've walked out there a few times, but always turn around and walk home.  Today I was walking over the bridge to get to a bank downtown, and noticed something faded was written there.  Looked it up on Google Maps when I got home.  I wish it wasn't as faded, and that I'd been able to see it the times I walked out there.

“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."



God I love this. I wish people understood more clearly why I can't let go of my fixation, despite all the programs and therapy and meds. I don't know why I'm posting this. I just want some people to know what it's like and why I can't change.

I surmise it's because we over-think everything, live inside our heads, are disappointed by what seems possible yet isn't, and/or are aware enough to see more than just the pleasant. :/



BUT...I believe happiness is still possible even in such a state of consciousness. :)

I'm living in a constant spiral of self-hatred and failure. The only thing I can successfully do is be a complete asshole to everyone around me. The stress I live in is somehow continuing to kill something that died long ago. Nothing matters to me, yet everything around me can set me off. I can't even talk to people without putting up fronts to cover the hundreds that have already been worn out. The mere concept of continuing to exist shakes me to my core and causes me to shut down.



But hey, at least I'm passing my classes. That's all that matters, right? *Right*?

Obviously long story short, it's been a rough week and today started off just a little shitty but got exponentially worse by the hour.  It's left me with a deep feeling of not wanting to be around any more. Not in the sense that I want to kill myself but I just am fed up being me I guess? I feel like everyone in my lifes live's would either have no impact or be even better if I never existed..

I have a few close friends and family but I feel so incredibly alone.

When Frodo says: "I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened." Gandalf responds with: "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us." I've been where Frodo was so many times, wishing I hadn't done something or that I had done something different. You know the "if only I" or "I should've" moments where we are living in the past. I find at least a little hope in what Gamdalf says. Maybe I can change my future for the better if I choose to correctly use the time that is given. I don't know, I might be full of shit too.

I made it a whole day without crying. It sounds so small and it's pretty sad that I'm so stoked about it, but it really is an accomplishment at this point. I have cried so much, and I am so tired of crying that for it not to happen all day (shit, I didn't even come close) is nothing short of a miracle. I hope this doesn't come off as too much of a bummer. I just feel like things are getting better, even if it's just one tearless day at a time.

It's not at all good, but I think I tried to depict what I feel on a regular basis. I couldn't sleep tonight, and have a funeral to go to later, but drawing this made me feel marginally better. I hope you like it.

Well against all belief, I somehow actually did it, I somehow managed to get the job I really wanted. And now I have my first full time job out of school despite feeling terrible before, during and after the interview.



 It feels surreal and I still don't quite believe it. I was literally having multiple panic attacks and contemplating suicide for the past few days because I was convinced I failed and wouldn't get it. I was honestly probably at the lowest point I can remember being in, I was ready to give up on life. And now it's like...I don't have do that anymore. I am lucky, unimaginably lucky.



Honestly, this was probably emotionally the hardest part of my life to get through and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I'm really hoping with this behind me I can start to get some control over my mental health and gradually build some more self esteem. 



Life is to short to waste feeling miserable like I have for years. And now without having to worry to worry so much about the job thing I can focus more on finding a new doctor and doing the things I enjoy.

I was the bookworm kid. 



Reading used to be a huge escape for me as a kid, but since I've grown up, and the depression's gotten worse, things just...don't click? Maybe it's the lack of quality in YA fiction, but I don't know. I can't bury myself into a book anymore.



It just makes me feel sad. It's like a part of me's been scrubbed away.



EDIT: Thank you all for the support and recommendations! It's nice feeling excited and actually wanting to go to the library again.

"You can't multiply 30 digit numbers by 30 digit numbers in your head? I'm sorry, I can't imagine what that must be like."



"Some days I struggle a little with multiplying 30 digit numbers by 30 digit numbers in my head, but I find having a cup of tea and going for a nice walk really helps me. Have you tried that?"



"You used to be fine with multiplying 30 digit numbers by 30 digit numbers in your head. What happened?"



"Take it step by step. Maybe warm up by multiplying this 20 digit number by this 20 digit number in your head first?"



"The other day I saw you calculate that 3 $2 avocados cost $6. If you can do that then why the fuck can't you multiply this 30 digit number by this 30 digit number in your head?"



"Look, nobody _likes_ multiplying 30 digit numbers by 30 digits numbers in their head but we all have to do it. That's just life."

I tidied my room! Well, in the process of tidying. It's a fucking tip. for the last 2 weeks I've done nothing but sit around the house being very, very low, with thoughts of self harm. But today, I've just gone crazy on my room, with multiple disinfectants, multiple bin bags and even some dancing, im cleaning. I feel good for the first time in a long long time, even though today is a very sad day for me. But I've got a new friend who motivates me, and for that i'm very thankful.



It's been an interesting few months, but for the first time in a long time, I'm not at rock bottom. Im very thankful. It's like im cleaning away my sadness or some bullshit metaphor. 



Point is, cleaning woot!

whenever I meet someone, I have to initiate contact, otherwise they loose interest. Even in my childhood, I was rarely invited to parties or events. My friends enjoyed my company when I was with them, but they never call. This is not for the lack of trying either. I threw a get together for my highschool friends. They seemed interested and excited. But nobody came. I now feel that their friendship was fake, forced as to not make me feel bad. I tried giving them space too, see if they might call to check up. I have not talked with a friend for over a year.

Even my family seems to recoil at my presence. My siblings never ask how I'm doing, they only contact me when they need something. My parents seem to care, but only about my success. Who cares if I am fully and truly lonely as long as I have a degree and a respectable job that they can put on their fucking wall. Bottom line is, nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody has, and I don't see this changing in the future. Every bone in my body aches every second for a genuine relationship. Can anyone relate to this?



(Sorry for the rant, I am in a rough spot right now and nobody gives a fuck)

So.. Today I was having a good day! The first in a while! I got up at a reasonable hour after an actual nights sleep, I've had 3 meals, brushed my teeth, braved the cold and cycled into my nearest town to have a coffee with actual real people in person! 



Then I went on reddit.. It was good at first, I saw some things that made me smile and that felt great! I had the balls to make a comment on a new-ish thread on a high traffic sub because I felt good and sure, what could go wrong? Well.. Lots actually.. 



I got crucified for using an ellipsis correctly by grammar Nazi's. Way to make a depressed dyslexic seriously worried about cognitive decline feel.. By other IT people who criticized me for not knowing about a feature in a service I don't use and by others, where were not IT people, for engaging everyone in what I thought was a polite cordial tone but they somehow took as me spoiling for a fight



So I deleted all my comments.. Even the one's making loads of Karma.. Because fuck that shit.. I don't even want to be reminded.. It's the first time I've ever deleted anything from Reddit and I'm not proud of it..



And if that one guy who pm'd me reads this.. Thanks.. Thanks asshole.. Thanks for tormenting me and reminding me that no.. No I can't hack getting ripped to shreds on the internet.. And no, no I should NOT have to expect this.. You should be less of a douche bag IRL and be more considerate of others and how they might feel or be feeling..



So.. Now I sit here.. Feeling like today was actually worse than the last few days.. Back again to wondering why I ever social media..



I know this is kinda very ranty and why more melodramatic than what I normally what I see when I lurk.. But I really just had to say something.. To anyone about how bad this whole experience over the last 2 hours made me feel and here felt like the best place..



EDIT: I don't know where I expect this to go, but I would just love to thank everyone for chiming in! I don't feel great, but I don't feel shit either any more and in large part, that's that thanks to you guys!



So thank you



EDIT 2: Was listening to the You Are Not So Smart podcast and the most recent episode has a 10 minute primer on why people on the internet suck.. I found it fascinating so I thought I'd share that



Also.. Today isn't that great either.. But that's more down the death of Alan Rickman, a giant of acting but also a man a lot of people could learn a lot of from. A kind man with a giant heart.

I know that you can all be so loving and caring. Especially when there is a person truly in need or a fellow is down on their luck. I've seen it happen time and time again, and it is so inspiring.



I'm sorry; I don't have a crazy story or anything like that. The only thing I can say, is that today is my 24th birthday, and it's been a bummer of a day. My fiance of four years and I broke up on New Year's Day, I was let go from my job the day before, and my grandparents that I live with that raised me forgot my birthday. It's just a lot to take in all at once. Yet, I know tomorrow is another day, and I am always so grateful for what life throws at me, because I know there is a valuable lesson that can only be learned from hardship. I'm truly grateful even for today.



But...sincerely, it would be nice to just have a tiny bit of support. An itty bitty glimmer of hope and kindness. That's all I really want for my birthday.



I hope you, whoever you are that's reading this, have a wonderful, lovely life. And appreciate all the good that's in this world. Even when everything shatters, there is beauty in the shards.



Thank you for reading. <3



**Edit:** I wish I could meet each and everyone of you and let you know how deeply you've moved me, and how uplifting and awe-inspiring I've found each response and kindness you've extended to me. I am so touched, and I will never *ever* forget how so many compassionate and loving people like yourselves have affected me. What started out as one of my darkest days...was so abruptly transformed. You have catapulted me into the stars. :) I feel such immense gratitude, joy, and love for each one of you kindhearted souls. Thank you, with everything that I am. To the individuals who gifted me with gold: a most sincere, heartfelt thank you, and a BIG hug for you! I am speechless. I have never been gilded before, and it is so cute and sweet and touching! What amazing people there are in this world! Oh my goodness. Thank you!



And to those that are suffering in any way, whether you shared with me or not, I will be there for you, should you ever need a friend to talk to. And, you must know, dear sweet internet stranger, should you ever be in need of a hug...I'll always be there with open arms! *Hugs!* <3!!

**Edit 1: Thanks for all the kind comments and for the Gold! I will start looking through comments soon and sending some games. Please send your thanks to /u/anarchoqueer who has also been gifting people games :)**



**Edit 2: New game added: Skyrim Vanilla (Steam gift)**



**Edit 3: /u/anunnaturalselection has kindly donated DEFCON to the giveaway, please comment if you would like it from him!**



Hi everyone,



I did a similar giveaway last year and it was really well received. As the title says I have a load of steam keys and gifts leftover from various bundles/purchases. I know gaming really helps me get through tough episodes and so I wanted to try and help others who get the same benefits, especially during the holidays which can be difficult for a lot of people.



All you have to do is comment back saying which game you would like. Please type it as shown in the list so I can easily find them with CTRL+F :)

If more than one person wants a game I will pick someone at random to make it fair.



I will either pm you or email you the key, or I will send it over steam if you like.



Feel free to [add me](http://steamcommunity.com/id/votequimby) if you ever need to talk or want to game :)



I will give the thread a few hours before I start sending keys to make sure more people can see it, and I would rather not give keys to brand new accounts or to anyone who is obviously abusing the giveaway (basically going by the /r/randomactsofgaming rules).



Here are the games:



**Steam Gifts or Misc Keys**

I feel as though I can't connect to anyone anymore. 



I need someone to take a chance on me. To think that I'm worth getting to know and to take the time to do it. 



I've had this a few times in the past and it's how I made the few friends I ever had. But in the last couple of years I haven't come across anyone willing to be my friend. 



I'm miserable and lonely. It hurts like hell.

Like those days where you feel more functional and you do normal stuff, you get out of the house and just generally act like a healthy person would. It makes me feel like a fraud, like I'm not really depressed and it's just an excuse for being lazy. I shouldn't be wasting a doctor's or a therapist's time, there are people in far more need than me etc etc. And then a day later I feel awful again and I realise 'hey, this isn't normal, I do actually have a problem'. And then I repeat the cycle over and over again. So tiring.

So to make a long story short I lost my daughter on April 16th of this year. I was so nervous at first to become a father, then I started to get excited and couldn't wait for her to be here.



Then she came early the morning of the 16th, and my fiance and I had the choice of aggressive measures to try and save her (there was really nothing they could have done, her lungs weren't developed and her eyes were still fused shut) or hold her and see her while she was still alive.



I'm only a 19 year old kid and I don't know how to handle this. I cry every day and sometimes just wish that I could just sleep and not wake up. Her name is Erin and she was the most precious and amazing little girl and I just want her back. 



I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this or if all I did was complain, I just want to stop feeling like my chest is empty

I wake up with all the things I should do running through my head. I need to shower, I should walk my dog, I should talk to people. I just dismiss it all by pushing it to the side and end up lying in bed all day telling myself I'll do it later. I'm still in bed and all I've managed to do is browse reddit for hours. Anyone else accomplished absolutely nothing today?

I've been blabbering a lot today and it resulted in some comments with negative karma and whenever it happens I get very offended by it. I keep checking my comments' scores and replying to people, trying to explain myself and be funny and chill. What the hell is wrong with me? Why do I care about what random people on the internet think? Why do I take it so seriously when I know I'm not really a stupid troll? Why in my mind a downvote means more about me than the hundred upvotes I received before? I feel so stupid and I know my insecurity is pathetic. Caring what people think about you is understandable and normal, but it's not my classmates or my family! It's goddamn reddit and I let it crash my confidence. I feel dumb as hell.

To all the submitters of /r/depression, even if you don't get comments or PMs or some sort of sign that someone's read your piece, don't delete it, don't be ashamed, don't feel lonely, don't regret it.



On nights like the ones I have now, it makes me feel less alone if I know there are others who feel as I do. I'd give you my words and thoughts if I could, but I'm a tongue-tied twat half the time and I'd end up (unintentionally) saying something that's the opposite of helpful.



Thank you for posting, all of you. Thank you for posting your rants, your acheivements, your thoughts and your day to day and everything you let me and the rest of us read. It gives me motivation and perspective and most of all, it makes me feel less alone. Please keep posting, and please keep trying. 



You all deserve the best.

I always feel like that after a while of thinking about my life. I feel it's physically hurting me inside, literally.



Lately I've been even doubting this reality in some way. Like, I look at my hands and move them around, then feel like this isn't real (it's really hard to explain, pardon me). I've also been hearing things and I feel like I'm becoming insane… :/

Yeah. I get that the feeling of depression aren't permanent. They come and they go. But the cycle is permanent. Pills, no pills, money, no money, it doesn't matter. No matter how happy I may be I know that it's only temporary as well. I can deal with the thought of being depressed for a few weeks. But being depressed every few weeks for the next 50 years? No thanks.

Any time I am feeling depressed or sad for a couple days, if I have a nice rainy or just dark and gross day, it makes me feel better. The past couple days I have felt pretty bad but this morning it was grey out, i went for a drive around in the water and just felt better, came home and had a pretty okay day. Anyone else really like that kind of weather?

I know part of it's because of the depression that's been poisoning my mind since I was a kid but anywho. 



My one friend, my mum and various counsellors over the years all know I'm 'depressed', but they don't know the half of it really. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't ever tell them what I'm really thinking day to day. Mainly that I pretty much constantly think about suicide, how lonely and desperate I am, plus a few other things I probably would rather not say on reddit. Even when I've been to counsellors I the past, I just have a total inability to be honest, even though I know that's the whole point of therapy.



Most of the time I just feel angry at them all, like they either wouldn't care, would care too much, would lock me up, or pity me. That they haven't earned the right to know what's really going on. 



Sorry if this seems pointless or if I seem self absorbed, sometimes I just have to vent to people who don't know who I am. Thanks.



Edit: Shit. I didn't expect to get more than 2/3 comments on this. Thanks for taking the time to share stuff, Ive read it all up until now. Love you guys

Why was i so inhibited? I didn't smoke, drink, fight, fuck, party.

I was not rebellious in the slightest. Not risk-taking.

What does that make me? A boring robot? 

I am lonely. And i feel so damn INADEQUATE. 









I wish i was risk-taking and extroverted.

I wish i had done more things. 

I don't have many embarrassing memories or stupid mistakes. I just have a big fat fucking regret of not having life experiences

I didn't chose this personality. I have always been easily scared, obedient, and calm.









Boring is the worst insult. I will never be fun to be around.

Mostly it has caused me loneliness in my life. Especially when it comes to romance. 

I can't really impress anyone. I'm not exciting, i don't do spontaneous things (but i'm lately became self aware, trying to force spontaneity) 

Neither is my depression dramatic and violent. It's not like in pop culture. 

It's slow, silent and pathetic. Worst of all is the feeling of inadequacy. 

The frustration and self hate that brings tears to my eyes. 

Self hate takes up alot of my time and focus.

I don't know if this the right sub for this, but watching this video broke my heart. Used to be subbed to this guy for his minecraft lets plays and seeing this pop up in my sub box hurt. He doesn't get any views so very few people are going to see his video. He needs some love and support :/

Please share your experiences with what has helped you manage your depression, in any form. Whether acute or day to day, mild or severe, simple or way out of the box. Let's collaborate and help all of us to feel better.



[Note that I started a very similar post in /r/anxiety, and it is NOT an xpost. Depression and anxiety often go hand in hand, but they definitely warrant separate conversations just as they have separate subreddits. Please feel welcome to join the discussion on both threads. **Let's get better you guys!**]

Like, yes, I admit it. I want someone to pay attention to me. Because I feel like shit. I'm scared and lonely and spend about 75% of my day with thoughts like, "I don't want to exist anymore," running through my brain. I deal with it alone because no one wants to hear it, and therapists, aside from their uselessness in my experience, charge money I don't have. So yes, you caught me, I want someone's attention. Why is it so terrible to want that? Why is it okay to guilt me for that?



*edit* I guess I should say of "just wanting attention." Yes, obviously, depressed people often do WANT attention, but it's not in the selfish, manipulative way people often perceive it. It's because they need help because they're in a lot of pain.

For the past few months I just feel like I'm growing increasingly stupid. For example,  when I talk to people,  just every day chit chat, often my mind goes completely blank and I'm totally at a loss of what to say. In my mind,  my conscience struggles to form coherent sentences. It's like my vocabulary is shrinking. My thoughts are scrambled. I can't concentrate on anything. 

It's frustrating. Really frustrating,  because I can't escape it.

(Originally posted in /r/nosleep, someone suggested I post it here)



I am a pretender.



There are a lot of us.



We go about our day the same way that you do. We go to work, school, the store, etc. We wave and smile at our neighbors, we water our plants, walk our dogs. But there is something different about us. It’s very delicate; it’s elusive and hard to put your finger on.

 

It’s a monster.



Pretenders blend into society seamlessly. Parents don’t know, friends don't know, lovers don’t know. I didn't even know what I was. Not until college. 



In college I realized that I wasn’t normal. Other students would go out on the weekends and get drunk but I preferred to stay in, alone, and watch Netflix. Even so, I still managed to make a few good friends. I found out later that they were also pretenders; no wonder we were drawn to each other.



Pretenders are hiding something deep inside them. There is a darkness that radiates. These people try hard to hide it, but there is no mistaking the dark mind of a pretender. 



When I realized that I had this darkness, I knew I had to do something about it. I went to a doctor, a therapist, a psychiatrist, but the darkness fought back. I would escape it, if only for a day, and then it would drag me back in.

 

I’m not really sure what this monster wants, it doesn’t appear to gain anything from the situation. It just isolates its victim and slowly kills it.  Like a parasite, it slowly leaches out life. 



It took me four years to kill my monster. First, I figured out what I was. After that, the long battle between me and my darkness began. Doctors gave me medication; I met with a therapist once a week. The darkness slowly faded away until eventually it was no longer in control. Occasionally it will try to take over again, but I know how to defeat it now.



I'm writing this as a warning. This monster can be killed, but first you have to find it.



Ask yourself, how many pretenders do you know? How many of my friends and family are being slowly killed?



Find them, and please, help them. The longer you wait, the stronger the darkness gets.

... And what that means is that all of your accomplishments are magnified. Even if those accomplishments seem meagre to you, well, you achieved them despite having a mental handicap put on you at birth that you had no control over. So you've been living life on hard mode, and yet still achieved the things you did! I made a positive post for once. Admittedly, this doesn't really work if you don't feel you've EVER accomplished anything remotely good.

A ton of my comments are about my experience with something.



"**I** did this, **I** had this feeling" instead of "**You** must be having a hard time. Do **you** need help?"





a lot of time i just don't know how to give good advice so i'll just keep my mouth shut



If I do this just ignore me. And, this goes without saying, but thanks, for putting up with my shit in the first place.

Having parents that would be upset if you died are the bars of the cage. If my parents weren't in the picture, I don't know what would happen. It's like your being forced to suffer because if you end it, then others have to suffer. 



Fuck depression and everything about it. Nobody asked for this. Nobody, as young kids with aspirations and dreams, saw themselves wanting to end their pathetic shitty fucking life that has zero future because they can't take it anymore. I certainly didn't. 



I wish there was a way to just respectfully disappear.

I've decided to finally get help. I'll be contacting my school social worker ASAP on Monday when they open.



I've decided to not surround myself with the negativity that is this subreddit. Don't get me wrong; I loved posting on here to vent and I loved looking through posts to help others. However, it never really helped *me*. Simply venting out my problems only worked wonders for a moment, if at all.



As I go, I'd like to say thank you. Thank you for those who read my posts. Thank you for those who commented on them. Thank you for those who may not have commented, but spared a moment to think about me.



I wish everyone on this subreddit good luck, and may everyone find their own source of help, be it professional, from a friend or simply continuing to use this subreddit. <3

I don't really have anything profound to say, or any point to make. I just need to express the way I'm feeling in some way or another.



College is hard with depression. It's so hard to pay attention when you're constantly drawn inward by the feeling of dread and anxiety ripping away at your innards. It takes so much effort just to keep depression at bay. Trying to do that *and* trying to learn just feels so impossible. Even when I do pay attention, I find that I don't actually retain much of the information. I'm sitting in class right now and I should be doing the activities and learning, but instead I'm just sitting here on reddit trying to distract myself from myself by posting a sob story. I'm so useless.

Today, I felt the shittiest I think i've felt in over a year.  I got home from work, did some of my homework, and then had no energy to do anything but lay in my bed.  



I don't exactly know what happened after that, but after about an hour of laying there, something happened.  Some uplifting song lyrics popped into my head (Music has always been a very positive thing in my life), and I was able to get up. I've never been able to turn my mood around like that, ever. And then something even weirder happened. I took a shower.  Normally this doesn't even happen on good days for me, so that's why it's such a big deal to me i guess. I don't think I had one before that for at least 4 or 5 days.  



I just felt compelled to share this for some reason. I hope someone can find at least some sort of comfort or meaning in it.

I am Japanese.  Many tourists assume Japan is cool, and full of polite and nice people, yet Japan has high suicidal rate.



I think this is because when you are nice, some bad people will take advangage of you.  (It goes the same anywhere I guess.)



I can be a often too nice and naive, and I trust people so easily that I find myself in risky position...  I have been a target of abuse and bullying all my life.  It started from my own parents, and now Japanese work place.  I have managed to escape from each and every abuse by turning to police, Labor Standadard Inspection Office, and so on.  I have been lucky to escape them all, yet whenever I go to new environment, or relationship, I still become the target of bullying.  It repeats because I have depression/PTSD, though I "look" healthy and respectful.



They just do not understand.



I am 35 years old, but still look young and happy.  But I have attempted suicide a lot of times (from cutting my own wrist to overdosing sleeping pills) I fail to kill myself everytime.



I have visted the infamous Aokigahara, and it was a beautiful place.  Yet, something tells me that, if I try hanging in the forest, something bad will happen, yet I remain alive, suffering from even further pain.  (my mind might go crazier, or I might get permanent physical damage even though I am forced to stay alive.)



I want to die, but I cannot, which depresses me.  I need to escape from Japan.  But I am not sure if I can, which depresses me.  I want to not be a victim of bullying, but it is accepted as a part of culture, which depresses me.



I do not want support.  I just want to contribute.  But I am no happier even if I did or not.



However, I thank you  very much for taking time to read my writing.



Edit: Thank you very much for beautiful, inspring helpful comments.  I stopped drinking alcohol today(!), and I woke up knowing I am not alone, and I will start planing to move out of Japan.  This was never possible without comments on this post, and I cannot thank you enough taking your time to write to me.  Thank you once again.



For those who private messaged me, I will respond to you very very soon.  I have to work tomorrow but give me a week.  I honestly am thankful to each one of you who read and commented on this post.

Finals are here. I haven't studied. I can't muster up a worry anymore. 



Nothing really matters.

I just skipped one of my last physics exams because I forgot my calculator in my room. I went to grab it and I soon as I got back to my room I just couldn't make myself go back. What? Why!!?! I have to do this shit but I cant because my mind just decides that some days i'm just not allowed to do stuff. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life any more.

It has taken me over a couple months to clean it up, and I finally did it! I feel so so so so so so much better that I don't have that weight over my shoulders. I know it might not stay clean for long but I'm going to try my best to keep it tidy

I never thought of that before. HE said I just need to switch my mind off anxiety and depression and stop worrying. Because I haven't spent the last 20+ years of my life doing everything I can to fight this. 



I explain my history of lifelong depression, anxiety, childhood trauma, meds, substance issues, suicide attempts, treatment detention orders etc. He said read "dont sweat the small stuff" (I have read it before by the way). And to just "enjoy life". Reminds me why I stopped seeing psychologists before.



UPDATE: so I spoke with my doctor again and told him my frustrations and inability to want to see my psych again. Long story short I have spent 3 hours talking to multiple people, finding another appt and explained the situation and how I was treated. They are taking it very seriously based on what I told them as above and suggested that they might stop referring patients to him as he works there independently. I dont want to ruin someones career but at the same time I dont want to sit back and be treated like that or let others be treated the same.

They are happy and asleep, I joked around with them an hour ago and we were laughing and they were really happy. They love me. I love them.



Now I'm crying because they would be so sad if they knew how sad I am all the time. I'll never tell but I can't help to feel sorry for them, they deserve a happier child. 



Paradoxical.





EDIT: You're all amazing people with encouraging words. I don't think depression makes you a bad kid and I don't think I'm brave or amazing for hiding it from them, it's just that I want to try and cope on my own. I love those 2 people too much to make them worry about something they can't fully comprehend and wouldn't understand. But just because I'm scared of doing so with my parents doesn't mean it's a good thing. Sharing is amazing, you just have to choose when and where will you share, and to whom. I shared here and it feels great. Thank you for that.

If there's one thing that depression has taught me, it's the fact that if you recognize the problems in your life you have the power to fix them. No matter how hopeless you feel on the inside your actions can still have positive outcomes and you can better yourself.



I'm not saying I'm at all out of the woods yet, but I at least feel like I'm progressing for the first time in about 3 years. Also today's the one month anniversary of me quitting cigarettes, cheers.

For some reason after I walk away from a conversation, I always think "I should kill myself". I just feel so depressed after talking to people, even if there's no reason for it. Even just a "Hi" to a cashier and I'll feel a small wave of melancholy or a suicidal thought afterwards.

I suppose I've been depressed since I was really young- even as young as 1st grade I would write stories in class about how nothing in life made me happy and got in trouble for saying (what I thought were casual) remarks like "I wouldn't mind dying." I've kept these thoughts close to me as I grew older, because we're taught that these thoughts aren't good for us. When I started college 3 years ago, I had no ambition for life and I made the mistake of getting into a breakdown/rant on the phone with my parents one day. They immediately sent me to therapy and a psychiatrist. I was started on Lexapro for depression/anxiety, then also Vyvanse for ADHD. After over a year, I felt no different, and my psychiatrist refused to consider a new med/new dosage, so I switched to a new psychiatrist, who only added Wellbutrin to my current meds. 



Last week, I spent the weekend in my room, didn't get any work done, and didn't even procrastinate by watching Netflix or something. I just sat staring at the wall, and I decided to go off my meds. Now I feel some weird clarity, and I got enraged while meeting with my therapist and telling her I'm off the meds. I'm not a smart person, maybe slightly above average, and I'm not claiming to be some fucking brilliant philosopher or anything, but it just makes me so angry whenever these therapists and people around you say that the thoughts about the purpose of life, or how trying to be happy is useless etc...they say that these thoughts are some illness, that it's wrong. I don't like how "recovery" from depression seems to just be masking whatever questions we have about reality. Every week my therapist just spouts off some bullshit about making the best of what situation I have with college/work/etc., and I don't have a say. Why can't I question? Why is it so fucking taboo to not want a life that holds nothing for yourself? I tried explaining it to her using a metaphor- life to me is like being wrongfully imprisoned. Being told to put up with life and force "recovery" is like being punished in prison, and all the inmates mocking me for a crime I didn't choose. She responded that "well, the guy could choose to be miserable in prison, or he could choose to be active and learn a trade so he can work when he gets out, or write letters to petition local congresspeople to look at his case." I don't want to do anything- at the end of the day it's still prison.



 I don't want this life- I don't want to be part of the rat race, or buying things, or being a functioning member of a capitalist society. I just want to crawl into a cave and meditate or sleep until I die or something. I dream all the time about how I could have been born into a different life...my ancestors on both sides came from humble backgrounds as farmers- one lived in a deserted area of the Alps, and would only climb down to the main village once a week to sell eggs and milk. And yet their descendants decided to immigrate to the US for the "American Dream." I don't want that fucking dream. I would be fine living on a mountain, doing my own thing, living on the land, without having to report to anyone except myself. On my worst days, I'm suicidal. On my best days, I daydream of running away and becoming a hermit or something. I don't make connections with people anymore because I don't want to explain myself anymore, or risk hurting their feelings if I did kill myself. I'm not an evil person- risk of causing suffering to those around me is the only thing that keeps me here. In my darkest thoughts, I wish that my parents would die, or be fine with separating from me...and just give me the money I would inherit, so I could run away and start a new life.



I feel so dehumanised whenever these therapists/"normal, functioning" people speak to me as if my thoughts are invalid. It's so condescending when my therapist tells me that "you haven't been actively seeking to find peace with your situation." All of her ways of "finding peace" are just shit like joining another organization on campus, or like going to the weekly dinner my volunteer job has. I don't want "recovery" because I don't want to be forced to comply with a reality that I don't care for.

Most of these distractions have consisted of career ambitions, most of which were entirely unrealistic. In my mid 20s I had lofty career goals not unlike any other self absorbed millennial, and I thought college and internships had me well on my way. Six years later and the sobering reality increasingly hits home: I was wholly naive about my prospects of attaining much of my career goals, and I did little to improve myself personally or professionally, as I always thought the next flavor of the month "opportunity" would work out. I lived at home until I was 26, and I seemed to always think every next week, month or year would bring about some kind of change or progress, thus living in some sort of vague limbo as opposed to "building" anything. Other times, these distractions would manifest in the form of a hobby or sport that I would suddenly become immersed in. At other times, it might be a relationship or just a summer with friends and not thinking about the future. Recently, I even moved to an entirely new city and lifestyle with the hopes of finding some sort of meaning to my life and escaping the distractions I had back home. It always seems to end up the same: the exciting new job or internship never pans out; the thrill of the new hobby/sport fades; the relationship fails; friends move on or up in life; the distraction is gone and I'm left wondering, "what I am doing and why am I so sad inside?" It seems soon enough I find a new career ambition, hobby, or social situation to distract me and the cycle continues. The difference is now I am cognizant of the pattern. I've thought about going back to school and such but I can't help but wonder if that is just another, "kick the can down the road" tactic, and I now realize that my unhappiness is a lot deeper than just petty career goals. I find myself increasingly resentful and frustrated with the world. I've become less social and less adept at even faking it. On one hand I am glad that I at least am at least more aware than ever of my depression, but the scary part is I really have no idea how to make myself happy beyond short term distractions that never yield long term change.

I want so badly for it to be over. I sat on a bridge for an hour tonight, willing myself to do it and willing myself not to. I know that it would destroy my parents, my siblings, my friends. But I just want it to be over. I see no point to being alive, and I hate existing. But I can't kill myself because of knowing what it would do to the people who care about me. I know I'm not worth caring about, but they don't really know me, so they don't see the truth. But regardless, they care, and so I keep going, solely for their sakes.

I wish all the time that I could go back be be myself from 5 years ago. Not necessarily to go back in time, but just go back to being me from the past. I was so much better at everything and I actually enjoyed things and was optimistic about the future. I used to be energetic and active, instead of lethargic and tired all the time. Now I consider it a good day if I actually believe my life won't one day end in suicide.

Ive been depressed for years and telling myself I didn't need pills.



I coped with alcohol, I drank 300$+ a month in beer. I no showed for work, I didn't pay my bills on time, I was always broke.



My mom always convinced me pills were for weak people, my anxiety has only been more and more crippling for months.



A few weeks ago I was prescribed venlafaxine 37.5. no suicidal thoughts, no anxiety. For the first time in a long time I feel in control of my life, I'm paying my bills, I am working a good job I like, quit drinking and smoking, and I'm feeling better than I have in a year+.



It's okay to get help, not every problem you can handle on your own.



**EDIT:** Thank each and every one of you kind souls for the upvotes and support. It makes me feel even better. I've been trying to reply to everyone but there's just a lot especially on my phone. I wish you all the best of luck in your adventures and escapades too, and I hope we can all find solace one day.

I'm a college sophomore and I had to go to campus for academic advisement today. I take all online classes because I have severe depression, GAD, social anxiety, and agoraphobia with panic disorder. I've completely psyched myself out for the past few weeks, worrying about this appointment. 



I *hate* being on campus. There was no way to get out of the appointment (it's required at my university to see an adviser before you can register for classes for the next semester). I had emailed the adviser back and forth over the past week, trying to see if I could just have a phone appointment instead of physically going to campus. I even told the woman that last semester I had a major panic attack in my car before even having the appointment, which made me late, which made everything worse. 



Usually these appointments end with me being very blunt, stating what classes I want to take, he/she either approving or giving me alternatives, and he/she hating me for my bluntness for wanting to *leave*. My adviser for this semester told me that I physically had to come to campus, that there was no way out of it. I've been a mess all morning, trying to motivate myself, trying to get past the fact that this woman was a royal bitch, that the appointment would go horribly wrong, that I would have a major panic attack in front of loads of college students and that I would die. From the anxiety and depression, of course.



After spending 20 minutes walking around campus trying to FIND the advisers office, I was even more of a mess. Borderline hyperventilating, everyone was looking at me weird, I felt completely alone and discouraged about everything. I finally found the office and discovered that it was under construction (there was some kind of leak). Just my luck, right? 



I met the adviser and she apologized for the inconvenience and took me *outside*. We sat on one of the benches on campus. I couldn't even look at her. I was thinking to myself "this bitch wouldn't even let me have a phone appointment. I just want this to be OVER." 



She asked me how I was while I just stared at the pretty trees, trying to not have a panic attack. There were people milling about, but nobody seemed to be paying attention except for her. I told her I was fine, and that I needed to hurry and leave because I had errands to run (it was a lie and she knew it).



I gave her my paper with the classes I wanted to take and she read through them. I felt like my heart was about to explode. I was snapping the hairband on my wrist, trying to distract myself from being in my worst nightmare. Nobody understands how much campus' and other places like that freak me out. I started hyperventilating again, just thinking about all the scenarios of what could happen, what could go wrong. 



The adviser kept looking at me and asking if I was okay. She didn't sit close to me, which made me feel better. She asked me how long I had been feeling like this, and I told her I have had depression/social anxiety/agoraphobia pretty much all of my life, and it's gotten worse over the past few years. She then asked me if I have been getting help, and I told her that I tried the could therapist/counselling thing and that it just didn't work out for me. She was *genuinely* curious about me, worried about me, and that *completely surprised me.*



Nobody has ever asked me so many questions about my mental illnesses. She didn't push or pry, she didn't tell me "oh you'll get over it"; "you're too young to be feeling this way" (I'm nearly 21). She just sat there with me and tried to make *me* comfortable. No other adviser has done that for me. 



At one point, maybe 15 minutes in, she asked me about my major, why I was taking online classes. I told her that I just couldn't handle being in class. I can't focus, and it makes me anxious. She *understood*. She gave me loads of advice about online classes, and about my major. She then started giving me advice about counselling, about how it's free at my college (which I didn't know) and how the counselor was extremely nice, and how most of the students that one counselor was seeing, positively loved her. She gave lots of details about one particular student, just about how he has social anxiety and how his major was tough and how he was feeling stressed out about his family. She told me about how a few weeks after she sent that student to see the counselor, he came back by her office. Out of nowhere. Told her thank you for sending him to see the counselor. She said that she had never been so touched by a student before. Said that she couldn't give me the student's name because that's completely against the rules, but she said that was why she took this job. To advise students, to help them, to try to let them succeed, to try to help them overcome their challenges.



Then she said something along the lines of "April, if you want, I can walk over to the counseling building with you. I'll introduce you to the counselor, and if you want me to, I can stay with you." She then gave me her personal cell number and told me that if I ever needed help, if I wanted to get lunch sometime, or even if I wanted her to just walk with me over to the counselor's office, she would help.



I was, and still am, in shock. I've always thought that if someone, a stranger really, told me that I NEEDED to be in counseling, I would get mad. But, I didn't get mad. I felt *relief* for the first time in a long, long time. Someone took just a few minutes out of their day to *help me*. All she had to do was approve my classes and let me leave campus as an anxiety-filled depressed piece of shit. But she sat with me, outside on that bench while I blankly stared at the pretty trees, and offered to help me.



I'm in awe, and I'll be forever grateful to her.

Sometimes I'll randomly not at all be upset about anything...I'll just feel a complete indifference for everything around me that makes me want to close my eyes and just die because the unbearable boredom is so fucking dull, and what's the point in doing something that feels pointless?



Small talk with people in my classes? It's boring, and I don't have the energy for it.



Study for my test tomorrow? Sure, I'm learning about really cool science that people use to understand the world and invent things, but it's just boring. Don't feel like it. Don't care if I fail. Don't care if I pass. Both scenarios are boring.



Take my dog on a walk? Boring. Can't even bring myself to pick up the leash. That would take too much energy.



Read this online article on a subject I used to really be intrigued with? Nah, don't care. Don't feel like it.



It's a really scary feeling when it happens. Almost like I'm slipping into death and something chemical in me is making it impossible to feel anything about anything. And I'm so fucking tired. And I just want to die because what's the point of sitting here for hours bored?

When nothing seemed to cross my mind -  

When silence passed the space behind -  

When conversations echoed dry,  

I didn't stop to ponder why.



*When days were lost attempts to hide*  

*The pointless hollow deep inside*  

*Where nothing found its feet and grew -*  

*I woke one day, and simply knew.*

  

I'd stepped my steps while others walked.  

I'd sounded sounds when others talked.  

I'd saved a smile to use at call.



I didn't feel a thing at all.

It's not like I do it on purpose, but...my depression is eating me alive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: I'm so sorry to hear that a lot of you are going through/went through what I'm going through right now. It's a shitty path and it's getting tougher with time.



(Replying to all of you now.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A little background on me: I am a 19/F going to a community college. My grades aren't as bad as they could be but they certainly aren't the best I can do. I feel like my depression is eating away every ounce of success I can get. 



I want to drop out. I feel like college just isn't for me. I feel like I'm not mentally stable enough to get through. I don't think my parents would let...I might really try to talk to them about it.



I hate talking to my parents about my depression sometimes, though. Every now and then, they through the, "Oh, it's just your period." or  "Maybe your medicine isn't working right." at me. Does it really matter that much? I'm not happy...



As of now, I am working (illustrator) on a children's book for someone and she is paying me. She has a lot more to come and doing this as a career would make me happy. I don't understand why my mom wouldn't just let me drop out of college and do this instead. This is my dream. I mean, I am getting paid so why not?

This weekend I got a kitty from my mom! I think it's the best. I haven't gotten much negative thoughts or want to do anything bad to myself. Even though I do feel depressed sometimes this kitty just comes cuddle by me and just brighten my day. Guess it good to have a companion. :) 



Edit: Sorry here's pics! Her name Zelda (:

To say the least, it's been an overwhelmingly nostalgic winter break for me back home. In the past week, I've learned that my sister is getting divorced (and has somehow gaslighted herself into believing it's her fault), my best-ish friend has gotten engaged, another is proposing, and I learned one of my cousins has transgender dysphoria and wants to begin living as a woman. I walk around my neighborhood at night reminiscing of all the times had. It is both nostalgic and melancholic, as I feel like I've hardly changed after four years of college and 2 and a half years out of school.Just been living out of state in a different city. I feel like Matthew McConaughey in 'Dazed and Confused' and I've even gotten that comparison before (the actor, not the character) which doesn't help matters. This Christmas, they were talking about who is going to be their best men, I hung out and drank with all of the 'kids' from just 10 years ago, am supposed to see another friend who I haven't seen in more than 3 years today. It truly feels as though the last of my childhood is going to die with the end of 2015, and I have a lingering dread that I've never done enough in my life and that I must accomplish everything I missed before I turn 30. Off to a good start by seeing 'Indiana Jones & THe Last Crusade' and the first 'Back to the Future' movie for what I can remember is the first time, and I feel inspired to write more non fiction stories about my adolescence from all of these new happenings, but still, there is always a lingering dread in the back of my mind that it is not enough. I have to evolve, keep becoming 'better'. In short, there's a lot on my mind this holiday.

Like how do people know your problems are temporary? That one day you'll get better you just have to make an effort to improve yourself. I hate hearing this. There's no guarantee things get better. And staying alive for another 50+ years only having a maybe one day things won't suck anymore isn't really enough to motivate me to keep living. The only things that's stopped me from killing myself is I simply don't have an effective method to do it. Because I sure have tried. A lot.

Been feeling like this a lot lately, so I visited the subreddit. After reading many comments, I feel this is appropriate.

I'm not suicidal.  I don't want to kill myself, but I do feel like if I could just die it would be the best thing that could happen.

Maybe it's really depression. Maybe i'm just slow and/or stupid. But i think everyone that believes our way of life is anything but completely incompatible with a healhty mind is fucking nuts



Everyone should just go away and leave me alone so I could focus on the voice inside my head that tells me to kill myself.

I've been considering it for years, and I'm excited to have it. Getting it was an adventure as well. It's on my right forearm.



A few people have asked me about it, and I explain to them, in short, that it's a symbol for suicide and depression survivors. The interesting thing is, no one has asked me about suicide.



One person said, "well, you're okay now?" To which I responded "I'm still here."





Edit: Here's a picture. (Stick and poke)

It's hard to get a good angle of one's forearm.

I honestly feel like I'm not allowed to enjoy cloudy weather or something. I just like it okay? But no its like it's only cause of my depression. I hate it when my feelings are invalidated like that. Bright, sunny weather just annoys and irritates me. But cloudy weather is nice, gray, and calm... I'm not saying people need to agree with me but at least respect what I feel good with without slapping "it's just depression" on it.

I wish I knew who to talk to, if I had anyone to talk to at all. A lot of the time, I'm too anxious to know what to do, and too worried to share my opinion or talk in public. I've gotten more irritable, and I hate it. 



At the same time, I wish I knew what I could do. How do you even make friends anymore? What do you do after you meet people?

I'm a 17 year old male and I'm romantically and sexually attracted to boys ages 8-12 (also normal aged guys mostly boys...)



Lately my lack of friends is making a larger void in my life that is often filled with the desire to be with a boy. 



I'm so disgusted with myself even though I've never and will never do anything to a boy. I really just wish i could make the thoughts go away but I can't and lately its seeming suicide is the only way to quiet my mind. 



I just really can't do this anymore.

I don't do my homework at home. I do it at school. I stay on the internet as long as possible so I can be distracted for as long as posssible. I am a fail. My face looks like a picasso paining and this eats me alive. I should be dead.

I've been very depressed for the past 3 months. Saw a therapist and started taking prozac. I'm still depressed, but not as bad as I was. I think a big part of me felt no purpose in life because I haven't worked for 3 months. So I started applying for jobs. Had my first interview on Tuesday, was offered the job on Thursday. I'm looking forward to going back to work, the office is really cool. I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess just to give some of you a little hope, and thank those of you who I've had the pleasure of talking to on here.

Depression hit in like my 7-8th grade and has been coming in waves for over 3 years now. Back then I was really smart, I liked math and was good at it. I just feel dumber now tbh.

Not even relationship wise, but i feel as if there is nobody who would just genuinely care about you in this fake society. The only person i can ever rely on is myself. I try to vent to my friends but they either just get annoyed or dont care. I always have fantasies about just meeting someone and them making my world feel better. Idk just a little rant from me

I begrudgingly told my boyfriend that I felt like I just didn't want to be alive anymore. His immediate reaction was to yell at me and tell me that he'll get me the cyanide pills.  The then proceed to call me stupid for thinking like that. It only made me feel worse. It's the first time that I actually opened up to someone and it blew up in my face



**edit: thanks everyone. I appreciate what everyone is saying. I'm trying to respond too but I'm on mobile. I really do appreciate all the insight your giving, I apparently forgot about how emotions play so big a role in both sides. Thanks for everything

**talked to him again and he said he will always say that when someone says they want to kill themself. That he would always offer the gun. I told him I can't be with someone like that, that he's pushing me further down by saying things like that, even before I had a plan. He just stared at me.

The last few days i've read some absolutely shocking posts here. The mods do the best they can but honestly, in the same way that I don't call a hotline when i'm at my worst because I don't want to risk a negative personal interaction with someone, coming here of late has been doing the same thing.



It's becoming clear to me that this place is becoming less and less safe to actually share your dark thoughts without fear of judgement. People are turning up of late calling OPs "entitled", saying they should be "happy with what they have" or acting the cause of their depression or worries are not good enough to be posted here. Frankly, this is unacceptable. Yes I report these (see: rule 2a/2b), but it's not enough, reading them has already done the damage. 



Even worse, if the OP tries to defend themselves against these sort of attacks, they're downvoted and insulted. People can't share that they want to feel selfish here, they can't share they're not okay with society, the rest of Reddit and it's political, ethical, etc agendas are seeping in. We're getting people in here that shouldn't be in here. Every time the subreddit is linked we get more and more shitposts and it's hurting me to read them when someone is crying out for help.



And thus it's time for me to go. I can't take this, not right now. I can't watch someone come here frustrated or crying or whatever and get beaten down like this. Maybe you haven't seen it, but I have. I read every post that is here when I am online, and the last few days have been *atrocious*. 



People coming here and giving out their "advice" laced with their own agendas, without reading the sidebar or getting a feel of what this subreddit is about are sickening. This is meant to be a place of support.



Honestly, I fully expect to be shitcanned by the people i'm talking about for this post. The people who shouldn't be on this subreddit. Whatever, i'm not reading it. I'm fucking done here.



My final update about me - i'm pretty much fucking done, i don't think i can last much longer, it's still another 2 weeks until i can see the psychiatrist and every day feels like it's burning at the end of a very short rope.



fine, i'm selfish reddit. you happy? i'm not happy with my appearent first world privilege and that makes me an asshole. i'm not allowed to be depressed because i have it too good, is that it? 



it's okay, i won't have it good for much longer. where i'm going, no one will find me. so be happy, the world will have one less defunct human that can't act like the robot you want us to be.



this is my last post, for the good of you, i hope you find peace. i know i will.

Just fuck it. I should not be feeling so fucking shit about myself all the god damn time. 

I recently got a new job and all I can think about is worrying how terrible I am at it. It goes against all fucking logic, they wouldn't have bloody hired me if I was no bloody good. 



Fuck the warped logic. 



Fuck the paranoid feelings that my friends don't fucking care anymore because they clearly fucking do.



Fuck you for reducing me to the weakling I am right now rather than the fucking legend I once was.



Fuck you Depression and the Horse you rode in.

My brother and I are both 15 years old, and we do EVERYTHING together. Or at least did, and I absolutely loved him. 



4 years ago, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and he went through 6 rounds of chemotherapy, countless weeks in the hospital, and multiple surgeries in attempt to rid the tumor. For the first 2 years, Never in the world did he sleep for more than about three hours without waking up for at least ten minutes, for fear that he would lose himself. 



But of course, things had to get so much worse. After about week 116, my brother couldn't talk anymore. He had to adapt and learn sign language so he could communicate with my family and the doctors there. He was still fine for a little while longer. 



About four weeks ago, James's (my brother) tumor disappeared. Miraculously our prayers had been answered. Then one day he came home from his tutoring saying he felt weird. We went to the doctor, and the doctor said his tumor returned, and was given 5 days to live. But being the person he is, he made sure he stayed around for as long as possible. 



My brother isn't like anything else, he was the only thing that could inspire me to do anything, and now that he's gone, I feel no use for anything anymore. I need some help, please redditors. 



Thanks

The worst part about my depression is that I have a good life. Thus far, I've got a whole list of achievements that other people are envious of. Sure, I'm not the most sociable person, and I've never really had a girlfriend at 21 years old, but I've done things that people didn't even know were possible. When I tell people some of the achievements I've made in my life, some people's jaws literally drop. When I show them how talented I am with games or coursework, I've had many in disbelief that I wasn't faking it somehow, and I've seen their eyes go wide with amazement.



I've fucked up here and there, made plenty of mistakes, but nothing that actually amounts to anything, not even a speeding ticket. I'm in college in a major I know I'm good at, and that I know I can get a job from right out of college.



I'm in shape, I'm relatively attractive, I've got a family that loves me, and I've got a bit of spending money on the side that my parents give me. I don't even have to work a job.





And it all makes me feel like shit. I'm severely depressed and I have been for almost 5 years now. No reason for it really... I just am. And it makes me more depressed that I have all this, and I'm not happy. I feel so undeserving of everything I've been given, that because I'm depressed that I'm taking everything I have for granted.



I'm not in debt, I haven't lost my job, nobody in my family has died, I'm not obese, I'm not disabled, I'm not addicted to drugs, I'm not anything that I feel qualifies someone to be depressed. I'm just a lazy antisocial white privileged male who has been handed everything in life and just hasn't been handed enough. Or at least that's what the depression tells me.

A while back Wil Wheaton passed along this advice to someone who posted to this message board. Seeing those words changed my life. I still have depression, but reading these four words was a reminder for me to focus on the part of me that isn't depressed. This past Saturday I was going to get the quote tattooed on myself, but opted for this instead. I'm a righty, guided by my right hand and every time I catch the tattoo out of the corner of my eye, I'm reminded that I am not this disease.

Just wanted to share. (Thanks Wil. Your words changed my life.)

I'm a youngish guy (late 30s) and just finished with the horrible experience that is a funeral.  My wife of 15 yrs passed three days ago, with no warning.  I am 4000 miles away from all of my blood family...though all of hers is local.  She was my whole life and purpose, and now I feel so lost.  I know these feelings will lessen with time, but I am hoping somebody out there has gone through this and can offer some good advice to help the numbness and pain.  



EDIT: Try for all the well wishes and all the very good advice.  I do intend to go back home in the UK in the spring for a week or two to see all my family.  

Those that asked what happened.  She passed in her sleep after taking her afternoon meds (she had lots of meds due to lots of illnesses) so at least is not longer in pain.  It is hard not to feel guilt over not seeing a problem sooner etc, but I also know that is foolish thinking.

So I work the overnight at a corner store. I'm actually at work as I type this. 



Tonight a young man who said he was 19 called my store because he couldn't sleep and had noone to talk to. He said he was depressed and was having a hard time with life. I chatted with him for about 20 minutes about different things, he asked me for advice and at the end of the call thanked me for talking to him. His tone of voice seems much happier at the end of the call. 



I suggested to him that we grab a coffee sometime, he seemed like he wanted to but wouldn't take my cell number. I told him he could call any night to chat if he wanted. I really hope he does contact me again, he seemed like a really chill guy. He assured me he wasn't going to harm himself so I guess I have to take his word for it since he blocked the call.



Anyway I just needed to share this, not many people are awake for me to talk to right now. If you ever need someone to talk to, be it a friend or family member or just a random stranger over the phone. Please don't hesitate to do so. 



If anyone wants to chat on Reddit I'd be more than willing, I'm done work in two hours so hit me up.



Edit: I've got to head to bed for my shift tonight. I'll keep you posted if he calls again.

Walter Mitty Syndrome is when you daydream about yourself being in another life as much as or even more than you pay attention to your real life. The name comes from a short story where the main character thinks up exciting scenarios for himself in his head when he's bored. I don't think it's a formal diagnosis, but it's a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder, and it's something some depressed people tend to do also.



I just recently realized I've done this for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I would daydream about a life where I was happy. I'm almost 25, and I swear I do it more and more as time passes. In my current fantasy I am happily married with children and money isn't an issue. I get to travel anywhere I want and live however I want. It's scary sometimes how often I find myself in my fantasy. Sometimes I don't even know I'm doing it, it's like it happens on its own. Much of the time I wish I could just slip out of myself and into the fantasy forever.

Upper respiratory infection out of nowhere.  Went in for the what he thought was pneumonia and died shortly thereafter.



I never had a dad, he was the closest I've ever come.  I had a breakthrough a couple weeks ago with him, realized where most of my feelings of guilt came from.  The tears that rained down that day felt so cleansing.



Almost a year with him.  He gave me one hell of a discount to my financial situation and lack of insurance.  It made me feel bad that I was getting him for so cheap.  



One of the kindest men I've ever known.



During our last session we talked about how much we both admired Eminem's "I don't give a fuck" attitude.  He was a pretty hip guy for a 63 year old.  



He encouraged me to follow my passions, to not let all the internal nay saying and fear get the better of me, to cultivate a rebelliousness within me.  I hope I can do him proud.  



Feeling a little adrift right now, not sure what to do next.  More therapy?  Mourning period?  Remember every session with him and right down every scrap of wisdom I can remember before it washes away?  Yeah, definitely that last thing if nothing else.  



Starting to cry again.  The thing I need right now is...a hug.  Even if it's just an internet hug I'd appreciate it a lot.  



Thanks for listening.  



**EDIT:**  It's funny how even internet hugs can help.  Thanks guys!



**EDIT2:** I hopped on reddit for the first time today to find tons of positive advice, great stories, and hugs.  Thank you all!!!

After all the pain that I've endured, I'm decided now...



I'll not commit suicide, I feel better now, it will be the summer vacation tomorrow, even if I've failed my exam I'll not give up yet. I've talked to my parents about my problems, and it's better that I expected.



Well maybe in some years I'll want to end my life again, since I still weird about my future and about mankind, I don't really want to work for the humans, who are selfish, kills animals in mass to eat them, created inequality, well my dream would be to bring peace in that world.. but it's impossible...



Well... also I think that my attempt would fail, I don't have enough sleeping pills to kill me.



I have to think more about myself and what i will do in the future, but in first I'll enjoy my vacations.

He was only 19. Why did he do it? He was lonely, he was scared, he hated himself. These are these the things he had told me before, and I fucking patted his shoulder and told him it would be okay. It looks like he posted here a couple times during his two years on reddit. He lived online. He always told me about how disappointed he was with himself.  How 'college was supposed to be the best time of his life' but he was wasting it in his dorm room. He was a bit of a recluse growing up, and we were never really close, but he was still my little bro. I have so much anger for the people that used to bully him and led him to believe he was worthless. I don't know why I'm posting here other than to create some sort of personal eternal memorial for him. I know you felt like you were alone, but goddamn I miss you little bro.



Thank you all for your thoughtful comments. You are all truly wonderful people

A clip from Harry Potter:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiWRoMOeoLo





The dementors in the book and film were a metaphor for depression. They sucked the life out of you leaving you feeling as if you'd never feel happy again. Although everyone was affected by the feeling, some, like Harry, were more affected by it than others because of the horrors he had witnessed in his past. Some of his peers made fun of him, others worried, not understanding why he was greatly affected by the dementors.



He eventually seeks a way to repel the dementors, and his professor teaches him a special charm to do so. His professor tells him when conjuring the charm that he needs to focus on a happy memory, i.e. feeling happy. This never produces a strong charm though. Towards the end of the book/film, we see what *does* produce a strong charm against the dementors.



In the clip I posted, Harry had traveled back in time and is now watching his past-self being attacked by dementors. I feel like this scene touches on meditation or at least viewing yourself objectively. He's watching how the depression is affecting him from a detached state.



His past-self had thought someone else had produced the charm to save him, but then his present-self realizes that no one else was there to do that except himself. He runs out and produces his most powerful charm yet. Later on in the book and film, he mentions to his teacher that he produced his most powerful charm not by focusing on trying to feel happy, but by doing what was right, needed in the moment, and by believing in himself.



If you notice Harry's face in the clip when he produces the charm, he certainly doesn't look happy, but because of the actions he took, happiness eventually finds him. Your goal out of depression shouldn't be to feel happy, but to be happy. Being happy means doing what you know is right, doing what you need to do, and *being* optimistic even when you *feel* worried, etc.



"You know exactly what to do. Don't be afraid. Keep on walking."



^(There are probably lots of things that could be filled in here, like eating chocolate after the dementors to make you feel better, which could be seen as appreciating the small things in life / stopping to smell the roses, and maybe I've mistaken some details, but I'm tired.)



^(Just want to also mention that it's impossible to feel happy all the time, which is why it shouldn't be your goal. You'll surely fail.)

So today was not a good day for me. Had a meltdown of crying in the kitchen this evening. She groks depression and anxiety, she suffers too, and we help each other out quite a bit whenever we're having a bad day. 



She walks into the kitchen, examines the boxes of Ritz on top of the fridge to make sure she got the butter garlic ones, then walks over to me. The box is turned on its face as she balances it on my head, steadies it, then backs up and asks frankly "Well, did it work?" in a very flat and confident tone. 



My brain goes from "hell no that didn't fix it, you dumb bitch" to "wait, did I miss a memo? Is this supposed to fix it somehow?" to "she's either mocking you or trying to make you laugh." 



Laughter won out, as I started laughing and crying simultaneously, the box of crackers falling off my head. I was worried for a split second that they were going to fall, and break, and that would be my fault too, but she caught it.  She started saying something like "I couldn't be sure if that would fix it, your manual was translated seven different times in three different languages, this is shoddy work." 



I don't know why it worked, but given how absurd her approach was, it got my brain out of the bootloop it was stuck in. 



Edit: I don't really think she's ever a bitch, that's just the rapport we have.

This world is hopeless. I have tried many different medications and therapists and nothing's working. I'm a socially retarded 19 year old boy. I hate college. I haven't made a friend in a year, much less met any interesting girls. I don't thoroughly enjoy or have interest in anything, and I've tried many things. Being alone is worse than being with people, though. I'm borderline homeless and it's 90 percent inevitable that I will become a bum. Once there, life becomes even darker and more hopeless. I have terrible anxiety that leaves me down for days over the simplest things. My health is declining. I can't drive so I don't get to live a normal life. Pretty much I'm saying my life is shit and I feel hopeless constantly. I have been suffering (mostly emotionally and mentally, but also a small amount of physical) 19 years and nothing's changed, so why would it? I think about suicide every day. I just want to lay in bed forever. And new problems arise every day. I'm so tired...

After years of struggling (and still dealing) with depression, anxiety, and anger, I asked my parents for an apology. 



I told them that because of the sexual abuse I faced as a child at the hands of my older brother, I faced very harsh realities in my life.  I wish they were there to protect me in my time of need. I was never sent to a doctor, therapist, or psychologist. They prayed over me at our shitty, judgmental little church and expected me to get better.



And I fucking didn't. 



I asked for an apology because I deserve one. 



I'm 25 years old and today, I'm taking my life back. I'm finally going to get the help I need.



To those of you who are struggling with shitty parents, family, or a fucked up past and they don't understand what you're going through, I'm right here with you, holding your hands. We got this.

So I've had depression for about 12 years now. 



Does anybody else get the impression that the only way to get people in the health profession to take your depression seriously is to try and top yourself off? 



Whenever I go to a doctor about my depression, the first question is pretty much always "Have you ever tried to harm yourself? Will you ever try to harm yourself?" and once I've answered no to both those questions, it seems like I'm basically fobbed off and put to the side while they go off to deal with the "really" depressed people. Then eventually they get around to me, give me a pat on the head and bunch of antidepressants, then send me on my way "see you in six months." 



Is this just an illusion? What are your experiences? For people that have attempted suicide, did you find you were taken more seriously afterwards or was the attitude towards you about the same?



Because honestly I am so at the end of my tether here that I'm thinking of strategically "attempting" suicide, just so I can get some proper treatment.

So yesterday was my 18th birthday. I made it.



When I fell into depression about 2 years ago, around 15-16ish I promised myself I would see to it my 30th birthday and if things weren't better by then I would end my life. As time I went on, I went from 30-25 then I dropped it to 20. 



Around Christmas I told myself I see my highschool graduation in June. About 2 months ago I set the date, my goal was my 18th birthday. 



I hit that goal and after accomplishing it, I think I'm ready to push onto graduation and the years ahead.



I'm not saying I'm cured because everday is a struggle. I have few victories but at least I have some right? If I killed myself the I would have never again be able to experience those small wins.



Sorry for ranting. Feels good to accomplish something, even it's just a minor win.

Two days ago my roommate made the decision to shoot himself in the head while I was the only one in the apartment. I was in my room at the time and was startled by two noises that sounded a lot like somebody dropping something on the ground. I didn't pay much attention because it didn't seem that loud, more or less like somebody fiddling around in the bathroom. It wasn't until 6 hours later my other roommate and I found him. He had missed the first time he shot and the leveled the gun and shot again. I had not put the two together until later that night and then the next morning it was revealed that's what he did. I was no more than 20 feet away from him when he did it, and all I can think about is those noises and seeing him. 



What honestly scares me about this is that I've had bouts of depression/anxiety for a lot of my life and used to attend counseling for it. The detective on scene told me that once somebody has seen something like this that they are 5x more likely to do it in the future. I wouldn't consider myself suicidal but I just feel really weird like there is this mundane lump in the front of my brain and my body has been tensing up. I can only relate it to when you're near a ledge and you feel your body getting ready to just jump off it but your brain is telling you it's not a good idea. Will these feelings pass?

I went out for one of my grad events and after standing around awkwardly after the thing was over, someone asked me if I was coming along with them. I ended up going with them and ended up having coffee while sitting around 9 other people, listening more to the chatter than trying to join the conversation since I never knew what to say, but it feels awesome to be included and I wish I got these chances more.

Like you just can't bring yourself to care about about people as much as you used to? I feel like empathy takes a considerable amount of mental energy, and I just don't have that energy lately. I care too little for anything or anyone. I don't know how to describe it - I just feel emotionally numb.

It's Monday.



The start of another shitty week of loneliness, anxiety and sadness, or so I thought when I first woke this morning. But then I kind of had a strange change of heart, I thought *fuck it*.



I got up, fed my cats, took a dose of the 5-HTP bottle I've been neglecting, donned some shorts and a tshirt and went for a run, and wow. I feel great, It's nice to have had my body physically worked out and this has boosted my mood x100. So far my day has been very productive and happy, and you know what /r/Depression? 



**It feels fucking good**.



This post isn't to gloat or brag, I hope that if you are reading this, with the same thoughts as I had when I woke up today, I can inspire you to do something for **you**. Something as small as going for a 15 minute, 2km run has completely turned today around for me, and it's a pissy grey day in England =D



Go, get off on the right foot, kick this week's ass. 



Because you deserve it <3



EDIT - Wow, I really didn't think this post would get so much attention. Thank you so much everyone! It feels great to know I helped some of you guys out, this was the whole idea behind the post. Stay strong guys and remember -



**fuck it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**

I found this to be a really inspiring blog entry, actor and internet personality Wil Wheaton posting about how suicide has affected his life and his experience with depression. With one very simple message, don't listen to what your depression tells you, Depression Lies.

When I was younger, my mom told me that my eyes made it seem like I was always laughing, even during serious discussions. She sometimes couldn't stay mad at me because of how happy I looked. Now all I see when I look at my eyes in pictures or in the mirror is ... nothing. Even when I'm smiling. Years of anxiety and depression have taken that away from me. Anyone else feel the same way?

80% of people with depression go untreated. Are any of the tens of millions of undiagnosed sufferers coming out for attention? God, no.



Even if 99% of the people you meet are faking it, the potential of further hurting that 1% outweighs any skepticism worth expressing. 



People like you make it harder for others to come out. Consider how hard it must be to add "am i faking it?" to the self-doubt that plagues you. Not feeling entitled to your own pain makes it harder to fight that pain.



"Mental illness is like fighting a war where the enemy’s strategy is to convince you that the war isn’t actually happening."



Don't make that war any harder than it already is.





P.S. how tf does it harm you to express concern for the not afflicted? does it make you look dumb? do you feel stupid afterwards for being fooled? would you rather be kind and mistaken or cynical yet correct?

Other people, with their schedules and their dreams and their enthusiasm.  Their ability to brush off criticism, deal with conflict, look forward to the future.  Their big plans, successes, milestones.  



And then there's me.  Some days I struggle to breathe.  Others aren't so bad.  But not good.  But not suicidal.  And that's supposed to be 'progress'.

I'm 33, and have been dealing with this beast since about 17.    

&nbsp;





I managed, got through school, went to a university and graduated with a bachelors in Economics, from a UC school (university of California).  Have had a few relationships, decent number of friends, etc.   

&nbsp;







Currently I'm working at a warehouse making a pittance and living with my elderly parents.  For the past years (many) I've seen my peers become successful, establish families, get married; all the typical shit I guess you would expect with someone when they reach 30+.  

&nbsp;









I feel that I have a high degree of intelligence (i could be wrong), shit, maybe I have aspergers or autism or some shit.  Anyways...It's like I know where I want to be and I know the necessary steps to take in order to get to where I want to be but I'm incapable of following that path?  

&nbsp;









What I really want to know (and hope to open up a discussion about) is the people that are in their late 20's, early 30's, and beyond that are still coping with depression.  What medications have you tried, what is your plan?   

&nbsp;













(more background)...most of the time I feel completely apathetic.  Most nights, since as long as I can remember, I've wished that I wouldn't wake up the next day.  I  have a very bleak view of humanity and the direction that we're going in.  More recently I've debated with myself the purpose of life.  Ultimately the purpose of a species is to procreate, procreate, adapt, procreate.... If I have no desire to have children then what is the point of my existence?  The point is to find happiness and fulfillment and blah blah and I get that...but let's say your brain is miss-wired (depressed) the majority of the time and there's only fleeting moments of happiness then what is the rationality in continuing on?

&nbsp;









I'm obviously a cynic, but reasonably so I feel.  Anyways, I want to change, I want to be happy and have some purpose in my life.  I want to hear from the older crowd about what they're doing /have done to make life more purposeful.  

&nbsp;







Sorry for the rant, I'm just getting at the end of the rope and am beginning to contemplate the end; my precariously unleveled existence...

I feel so out of place,everyone in my life is having fun,living their youth years  and I'm a suicidal wreck.  I'm missing out on life. My loneliness is soul crushing.

Also,the thought of everyone leaving me feels sort of...freeing. How weird is that? I guess because I'd have nothing to lose then?Idk,man.



I'd appreciate /r/depression's input on this...



edit:ok, I'd hug every single one of you.

Fuck I hate this question. Fuck off. I got home on friday night and sat in the shower with the water running until it turned cold then I went and made some horrible food because I can't cook and I can't even afford to eat lunch or breakfast 5/7 days of the week. Then I stayed up until 5 am in the morning on the computer because I haven't slept a full, restful, night in 8 months, then I got up at 7:30 am on saturday and wasted my whole god damned day worrying about getting fired at my job that barely pays enough for me to live. Oh and saturday night I got to cry. I cried for the first time in a long while. That was a nice break from the self-loathing and contempt I usually hold for myself. So I got that going for me right?



Is that what you want as an answer? No it's not! You want me to just say "Eh, nothing much you know just the usual what about you?"  so you can babble on about what YOU did instead. I'm so tired of small talk. I'm so tired of even trying to cobble together conversation with people who can't even be bothered to remember my name.

I haven't posted much, but I have read a lot of the posts on here. You all are terrific, and it was incredibly comforting to know others were in it with me. 



I am both sad and happy to say that I no longer need this sub. My life is going great, for the first time ever. I feel alive. Awake. 



I wish you all the best of luck. If I can come out the other side, you can too! Goodbye, my friends.

I just wanted to share this with others in this subreddit. Depression is a long struggle, but keep in mind you're not alone. If you can spare half an hour, this talk is definitely worth the watch. 

>  In a talk equal parts eloquent and devastating, writer Andrew Solomon takes you to the darkest corners of his mind during the years he battled depression. That led him to an eye-opening journey across the world to interview others with depression -- only to discover that, to his surprise, the more he talked, the more people wanted to tell their own stories.

Title explains it all. My girlfriend and I had had a fight and broke up. 6 months later, I get a phone call from her parents. Apparently, she had become pregnant with my child, and when she found out after 6 months, at first thinking it was just her gaining weight, she shot the fetus, then herself in the head with a 9mm. Her suicide note read that she blamed me for the whole thing, and that even though she didn't want the baby, I deserved it even less than her, so she took it with her. At this point, I was at a loss for words, and it took me a good few days for it to finally hit me and I broke down. I only told my best friend who has been there for me for 5 and a half years, and he told me life goes on and all that. Cliche, but it made me feel better. 3 days later, I get a call from his parents saying he had crashed his car, and died from severe internal bleeding. I burried him 4 days later. At THIS point, I've been unable to drink or eat much. Not without it coming up again anyways... I've dropped 20 pounds from stress, and I can't sleep or smile. I'm not suicidal, but I don't know where to go with my life anymore. What does a person do after this sort of thing? I really need a hand here guys.



P.S. Don't ask me to try religion, because I already have.

I have very little motivation most of the time.  I know this could easily be depression-related.  But, looking back at my life, the only thing that ever motivated me was pressure to succeed.  Now that I worry less about living up to peoples expectations of me, its hard to find motivation to do much. I'm just dragging myself through life, doing what I need to do to get by.  I don't enjoy much.... that's a part of a lot of peoples depression.  But did I ever really enjoy anything that much?  I don't think so.



I'm a very pessimistic, lazy person.  I'm selfish.  I complain and whine a lot.  I'm no fun to be around most of the time.  I know depression and anxiety are things I'm continuing to fight....but I can't help but think that a lot of this is just really who I am.

I always struggled with depression more or less during my teenage years and well after. I am now 25 and can say that I am on my way to recovery thanks to a lot of good people and luck on my side. With one of the people that helped me a lot, if not the one that helped me the most, I haven't talked for a very long time. When I moved back home, this December, I promised myself that I would get in touch with her again, but I said *"Let's wait after Christmas, that's for family and everybody's a little crazy during those days, I'll just let things cool down".*



Two days ago, I saw it on Facebook. She jumped to her death on Christmas Eve.



She helped me understand a lot about empathy and what it means to truly care for another human being, without wanting anything in return. She was kind and smart and beautiful and I can't imagine anyone that couldn't have liked her. She was involved in every club and charity you can think of and she always wanted to help. She loved nature and being outside. She loved to read. She loved making other people happy. She always had a smile and something helpful to say.



I feel like I was blind the whole time. She understood how I felt, but I never bothered to listen.



I really don't understand. I can't understand anything anymore. I feel like the world is closing in around me.



She was the best person in the world. She didn't deserve any of this. Anybody else. All of them. Just not her.



I haven't felt like this not even when my mother died. I feel like screaming my lungs out. I can only think about her and what went wrong. What could have gone better?



Every time I take a walk outside alone, I feel like crying my heart out. Whenever I'm with people, it takes all I got to keep it inside. Unfortunately, she and I have no common friends. Although I know a lot about her friends and her family, she was the only one that I really knew. I will meet everybody at the funeral and I don't know what to say.



I feel like I took away all that hope for me and left nothing for her. I just want one more minute to tell her that I'm sorry that I wasn't there.



My head feels like exploding, my whole body is shaking and I don't see any point. What the fuck Reddit? All the love in the world couldn't shine enough light to see what she really felt. The whole world feels empty and cold.

I always had 1 or 2 close friends but never a group of friends. I always get this feeling when i try to join a group that I'm intruding. It could just be my anxiety, but the thought of just being tolerated makes me feel depressed. 

How do I manage this feeling?

Does anyone else feel this way? if committing suicide wouldn't affect anyone in my life I'd probably just kill myself eventually and be done with all the pain. It just seems so hopeless, knowing that possibly for years to come I will feel like this. I just wish it would go away so that I could have a normal life.



Edit:



Just so you guys know I am NOT suicidal. I sometimes I wish that I could just end it, but I know that I cant. I have too many people that care about me to be able to throw it all away. I just couldn't do that to my friends and family.



Edit:



Thank you all for the love and support, it helps keep me going :)

Thanks for the comments and messages on the previous post. I really appreciate you all and wish I had found /r/depression a very long time ago.



When the Holiday season comes, I used to get overly excited about it. That's dwindled down tremendously these last few years. Normally, I call, text, hit people up on social media, try to arrange get togethers, try to get people together and OVERLY make sure people know I love them and want to see them, and be involved with them. This has led to me arranging flights cross country to see folks, take 16/17 hr road trips to see them and spend enormous amounts of money on gifts so they know I care. 



While in this current depressive state which I've been in the last few months, I decided to operate differently this year. I chose not to initiate to see what would happen. Who would look ME up? Who would send a gift? Who would call? Who would want to fly to see me or who was willing to drive a days trip to spend the holiday.



Currently in my dark apt, with the Christmas lights on. The answer is no one. 



I didn't initiate so no text messages of "Merry Christmas". 

I didn't initiate so no gifts this year under my tree.

I didn't initiate and no one is flying to see me this year. 

I didn't initiate and no one is driving to see me. 

No instant messages. No calls. No cards received in the mail. 



I didn't make the first move this year in my little experiment. Nobody initiated anything. Facebook, which I tend to stay off these days due to how it makes me feel--- FB is lined up with people posting photo albums. The same individuals I've ran off to see for years this Christmas had a perfectly fine holiday without me, and didn't check in or remember me. 



I've been careful not to post anything on FB. Or like anything, or comment on anything. And literally, I no longer exist to anyone.



Relationships are about the quality of the people you're with.  I've learned I invest way too much in people who clearly wouldn't invest back in me. I've cared way too much for others who don't feel the same. I've tried so hard to make connections... and clearly I am the only one trying to maintain those connections. 



I think maybe that was part of the reason as well I posted the other day that I couldn't go see my family. Maybe in hindsight, I wanted someone to come see me. 



Have a great Christmas everyone. I'm playing on Reddit and thinking about life.

I like rain.



I like rain becuase it makes me feel normal, it makes everything, normal. 



To others, rain is the worst thing that can happen that day, to me, it's the best.



When the sun comes out every morning when i wake up, i want to close the curtains, make the sky dissapear,make the sun burn out, extinguish it. 



That won't happen.



What will happen is, i will wake up, a feel the weight pressing down on my chest, and with the same heavy chest, get ready for another day of torment, another day of grey.



The same day for everyone else, is to wake up, feel the sun on their skin, the warmth of it, and feel uplifted, happy, with the same routine as mine, but their day, is filled with colors, vibrant, amazing colors.



You tell me i'm the one at wrong here, that everyone else sees color, and i don't, something is CLEARLY wrong with me. Right?



If you ask for help, you are a coward, weak. Whatever.



Take these pills, they will make everything better. It's the opposite. It makes everyone around you feel better, because they don't think you are a problem anymore. But the pills doesnt change our feeling, they simply numb them for a while, only for the effect to stop working, and you put on an act for everyone.



Let me rephrase how to wake up. You wake up, feel a wave of sadness wash over you, you get dressed, and you go down to eat breakfast, after that, you go get dressed again.



You put on a smile for everyone else, you put on a smile because you don't want to be the problem anymore.



I like rain.

I am just gonna disappear, just like the good old days. I got my backpacking gear all packed up, plus my my meals n shit. I just need to get away for a while. I while maybe set up next to a stream like last time. While I am there I will have some books and cards. Don't worry about me, I have done this a couple times before.

Anyways I will be away for a couple days, also fuck school. It's making me miserable, and the good old outdoors will refresh me and hopefully bring my spirits back up. I just need to enjoy myself and forget about the consequences. I will post when I get back, see y'all later.

or psychologist. Well either way, once i was telling her it's just not fair that physical illnesses and psychological ones are not treated equally. And then she came out with the "but psychological illnesses are different because you made them" thing. I am speechless honestly. I don't think I should change therapist YET ANOTHER TIME. Maybe I should just stop going and die.



EDIT: I was trying to tell her how someone with a flu could say "sorry i don't feel really well so I will be staying home" while me, feeling like complete (excuse me) shit because of depression, not being able to open mouth without ending up crying all my tears and wanting to die, all of this to the point of feeling physical pain in the stomach, heart and everything, I can't say that same thing because, you know, it's just psychological.



I used to go violin lessons but many times, when feeling really down, I wouldn't go. Sometimes I told them and other I didn't because well depression made me see everything black and I couldn't bother telling them "hey I'm staying home" and having them reply "LIKE FUCK YOU ARE GET YOUR ASS HERE". And that's where I had this guy, studying to become a teacher, who just told me "I don't know what your problems are, but at a certain point you GROW UP and leave them behind" as if depression was a matter of growing up.

I was very down this morning and sitting all by myself during break, I had my head down with my eyes closed when all of a sudden I felt sombody sit next to me. I look up and see that it's the girl that I like. She didn't ask if I was ok or why I look so sad. She just sat there and we started talking. It made me so happy it almost made me cry. I don't know if this is the apropriate place for this but I just needed to tell sombody. 



**EDIT** Jeez, I didn't expect so many people to read this and upvote it (I couldn't care less about karma) But jeez... :') You guys do rock.



**UPDATE** I actually went and sat down with a group today and while I was sitting down I felt a little nudge behind me, it was her! There were plenty more seats where we are sitting but she decided to stand by me! Then when break was over she wated up so we could talk about her new haircut... Golly is she a swell gal :)

Felt like sharing, since I'll probably forget those words by tomorrow morning. Also, I tried to overdose on vitamins, and now I feel ridiculous.



Thank you for listening.



EDIT: I really appreciate all the helpful words and support you guys have given me. I'm about to begin therapy which - I'll hope - will make me feel better about myself and allow me to build a life for myself. I made this thread to make sure I wouldn't forget these words, which she has spoken before, but I always end up forgetting and forgiving only to go through the exact same thing again.



You guys are amazing, and I hope things will work out for all of you as well, as I hope they will for me.

Hi. I'm very sorry but i haven't posted here (or anywhere) before. If I break rules or something can you please just disregard this, I don't mean to be rude or inconsiderate or anything. 



My wife has depression. She has been suffering with it for a few years now. It first hit really hard when she became chronically ill (unrelated to mental health) and her best friends bailed on her for being too much drama. She's had good and rough patches since but tonight has been tough. She sent me this message earlier tonight.  



"All my life, I have never been anything other than ordinary. I have never been exceptional in any way. I have never been pretty, or particularly intelligent, or good at sports. 

I have never been anything over than ordinary. Average.

I am okay with this. Most people really are ordinary. 

However, I am kind. And generous. I am passionate and considerate and whilst I can be selfish, I am often selfless. I don’t bully or harass others. I vent sometimes about people, but I’m not a gossip, I don’t spread rumours, and I am fiercely loyal. I care about those that I love, and would do anything in my power to protect them. I stand up for what I believe is right. I fight for equality and animal rights.

I have plenty of faults. I can be hot-headed at times, but I am almost never unkind. I worry too much and am often incredibly sensitive about things.

I am not perfect, and I have made mistakes, but I have never pretended that I haven’t. I have never pretended to be someone I’m not (at least, not since high school).

I do not believe I am a bad person. I do not believe that I do bad things or treat others badly.

Yet all my life I have never been good enough.

I’ve had friends, yes, and very good friends.

But for the most part, I am hated. I am seriously disliked by so many, and always have been, for reasons I have not and do not understand. I’ve had friends abandon me, time and time again. I’ve been bullied, picked on and ostracised. I was never liked in high school and I frequently overheard my so-called friends say things about me behind my back.

I was weird. Different. I spoke too much and laughed too loud or I was too quiet and too sad. 

And nothing has changed. No matter where I go, no matter what I do, no matter who I meet, it’s always the same story.

Over and over and over again.

I am weird. Different. Unlikable. Friends often turn on me, abandoning me for different reasons I am yet to understand. Some I never will.

And I don’t understand. I really don’t.

What is it about me that is so wrong? What do I do that makes people dislike me? What am I missing?

Do I do something wrong? Do I say something wrong? Is it the way I act? Behave?

Am I blind to my faults, so much so that I can’t see them?

I just want to be liked. I want to have friends. I want to know that the friends I have in my life aren’t going to suddenly abandon me, too.

I want to know what is so damn wrong with me that people hate me on such a frequent, regular basis.

Because this feeling is killing me.

And it makes me want to die."



Caring for her can be hard but there is nothing more worthwhile that i can do. I'm hoping there is someone on here who can relate with her? If that's you, what do you wish someone had said to you? 



Thank you

I have watched this sub for a while now. I have spoken about this before. People are going unnoticed here. They are pouring out their hearts and no one is listening.



If you are like me, there are a lot of people on here that have it worse and I can't give advice to them. I feel clueless when I read their posts. 



**But I still read it.** I still heard their problem, whether it be a cry for help or rage filled vent.



I am sure a lot of people come on here, read posts, and can't think of any way to help or relate so they move on. However, no one can see that you did that unless you **give an upvote.** On this sub, I see upvotes as a way of saying, "No, your not alone. I am listening."



So please /r/depression, please try to let our fellow users know you give a shit. Nothing hurts more than going to a place that is supposed to be supportive, and then being ignored.



Just a few minutes to read, then a click of a button.



That's all folks.

She told me that we were never real friends and that she only spent time with me because she felt bad for me, and that we shouldn't spend time together any more.



Fuck me for having feelings.



Edit: Thanks for all the support, guys! It's been hard for me but reading your guys' comments helps a lot.

That line from the Wallflowers song comes to mind--"this place is always such a mess, sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn."



I managed to sit up and clean my apartment in a frenzy. I feel like I can relax a little more. I just spent weeks staring at the accumulation of nonsense and clutter and I finally just sat up and cleaned.



Feels good. Small victories.

I've tried so hard to tell myself that if I keep trying and keep taking chances, it'll get better. I know objectively that life changes so much so quickly, it just has to improve someday, right? Especially so if I really put myself out there and earn some opportunities. 



So what exactly do I do when it never gets better? When I take a chance and it blows up on me, leaving me wishing I hadn't done anything in the first place? 



When I really try my best to do something cool, since y'know I've been stuck in a depressive slump and I want to get out of it right? Then it turns out to just waste my time, other people's time and put my ineptitude on display. Why should I have even bothered? I feel worse than before.



So sure, it'll get better. But I am really fucking tired of waking up to another long day when it's bad and it only looks worse from here on out.

I was in hospital for over a month and spent 3 days in ICU. I was deeply depressed and delusional. I thought I was an effigy to be burnt, or the sacrifice of humanity. Anyways these a three of the little drawings I did.

“The worst part about anything that’s self destructive is that it’s so intimate. You become so close with your addictions and illnesses that leaving them behind is like killing the part of yourself that taught you how to survive.”



I'm not sure who this belongs to, so please credit them if you do, it was just so real that I had to share.

I find myself just trying to find ways to distract my mind.  It's has been a combo of Netflix and video games.  I don't enjoy them like I used to.  I used to think "hey I wanna watch something."  Now I think "hey I need to distract my pessimistic ass mind by watching something."  Jw if anyone knows what I mean.

I know. It's difficult. I actually learned the hard way. And when the relationship ultimately ended I was crushed. My depression is "better" now(I'm more numb than anything). I learned that I can survive anything mentally. Even having the one person I love leave me, being nearly broke for 2 months,  and her finding a new guy within a week of leaving me, leaving him, then her getting impregnated by another guy. It hurt. Made me feel worthless and like she only stayed because she felt I'd kill myself if she left. 



Telling someone that they're your reason for living puts a lot of pressure on them. It may force them to leave one day because the task of pleasing you with depression seems too daunting and a lost cause. They may not understand and never talk to you again. Could you live with yourself after that? I barely made it.



However,  this is just my story and it may work out for you. It's just tough on the other person. Very. 



Live for yourself and those you wish to influence and inspire with your knowledge and experiences. Just some advice. I dont want anyone to go through what I did.

It's almost as though some part of me wants to stay alive just to see if it ever really does get better.





I really hope it does.





Edit: I really didn't expect this many responses. I've been having a really hard time lately and just kinda wanted to get this off my chest. 

You're all amazing and strong people, and I really hope that if it hasn't gotten better for you already, that it will soon. 

Stay strong friends.



Edit 2: apparently I like the word "really" a lot.

Yesterday my little sister, 18, committed suicide. She left a stack of about 25-30 notes addressed to people. In my letter she entrusted me to deliver her letters and belongings she wanted returned to her friends. Her friend's father got involved when my mom showed him the letter left for her friend. He said he will photocopy all the originals and hand deliver the letters and her belongings. He said we (mom, dad, older brother (25), and I) should sit down and decide what to do with her letters.



I had eavesdropped on that whole conversation. I got SO angry, and still am. I feel like I have failed my sister by not delivering the letter myself. She entrusted ME with them. I so badly want to scream at her friend's father to leave because she asked me to do it. She told me what she wants. I can't fail.. I won't.



My parents made me go to school today. Then they said I didn't have to go, but I still went because I didn't want to be home. They asked if I want to take a break from school. I'm a junior at a University, a 20 minutes commute away from home. I told them if I don't keep going I won't graduate in time. My dad said whatever the reason may be that I don't need to graduate in time. I don't want to let my sister down, but I can't bring myself to focus on school right now. I don't know what to do.



edit: i'm her older sister. we are only 2 years apart since she just turned 18. we're really close but i guess not enough.

In 2015, my dog, my mother, and my sisters were killed in a head-on collision.  My father, who until recently was a recovery alcoholic, comes home from work empty-he's just a shell of a man. He's cold, metal, and robotic.  He doesn't have any emotions.  All he does is go to work and church, then looks at photographs of our family.  



My "support" has been forced on me by school administration and students alike.  My sisters were fairly popular at our school, but the support isn't for me: It's for their bitchy, stuck-up airhead friends.  Everyday I'm required to check in with my counselor for our "happy" meeting where I'm drilled for half an hour on how it will all be over soon-about how what I'm feeling is temporary.  Each day the words she spouts mean less and less as I feel myself slip away. 



I don't want to do anything anymore.  I quit my job, I just fucking cry and jack off in my room because I don't want to deal with problems that can't be fixed.  I've tried, believe me I've tried.  I've seen three different professionals but they're all carbon copies of the other that just prescribe me shit that only makes me constipated or erect.



I feel like I haven't slept for a year.  Each day I feel more exhausted than the previous.  People that once made me social and happy now just cause me anxiety and confusion.  I used to have fun hanging out with them but I stopped feeling enjoyment.  I've stopped feeling anything.



I want it to be over but I never have the balls to actually do it.

I was just looking at a facebook post that linked to a video regarding depression. The woman in the video had taken a photo of herself every day for six years as she battled with depression. One of the most 'liked' comments on the video was: 



"Depressed people don't usually feel like taking selfies."



What the heck. 



I had what's called 'walking depression', I know many of you on here have or had that as well. I woke up every morning on time, was punctual to every class. I ate lunch with friends, sometimes, and I skyped with people from back home. I made jokes about my depression because that was the only way I knew to talk about it.



I also immediately went to sleep for hours the moment I got back to my dorm room. I started crying every time I opened up a textbook because the hopelessness I felt about school and life was just overwhelming. I self-harmed, I wanted to die, I almost tried to make it happen several times.



My sister has also struggled with depression for years. She has a sleep disorder that makes her sleep very ineffective, so she struggles with chronic fatigue. When her depression is at its worst, she can't even get out of bed for the moment it takes her to take the medicine that helps her wake up. She doesn't go to any class, she doesn't see or talk to people. 



And you know what? Fuck anyone who says that one type is more 'real' than the other. Fuck anyone who says that my depression isn't actually depression because I was able to get out of bed. Fuck anyone who says my sister 'isn't trying' because she can't. 



Your experience is YOUR experience. Don't let anyone downplay that. Don't let anyone try to tell you that what you've gone through isn't real because you don't fit into their ignorant, narrow bubble of what depression is. You know what is true because you've felt it and you've experienced it and you CAN trust that. 



Just don't let the confusion and the hate convince you that you're weak or you're faking it. You know what's true.

It's not the heat, but the crippling feeling of loneliness especially when everyone has friends but you. It's the feeling of drowning desperately wanting someone to save you, but in your isolation no one can hear your cries; not that anyone ever did, but there's a certain hope when you are surrounded by people that someone might. 



I hate summer.

This is something I read that made me think of all of you. 

"Depression is humiliating. It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your children, your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything outside of bed. You alienate your friends because you can’t comport yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. If you and your loved ones have been spared, every blessing to you. If depression has taken root in you or your loved ones, every blessing to you, too. No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a dentist appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. Depression is real. Just because you’ve never had it doesn’t make it imaginary. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. Have a heart. Judge not lest ye be judged." -Pearl

i can't remember the last time i was happy, or what happiness feels like, and i have found myself just thinking of scenarios in my head, where my life is better, or just normal and then i smile or laugh to myself for a bit. But then i come back in to reality and become miserable again and realise i can't achieve this normal life that i make up inside my head.

i don’t want to be a person anymore.  i have extensive experience - i’ve been a person for decades now but i just find it isn’t really working for me.  it was exciting for a while - there were toys and holidays and going to the beach and sledding, and animals.  but it quickly lost its shine and degraded into years of sitting idly pretending to care about numbers, and then pretending to care about more complicated numbers, and then pretending to care about objects, and then pretending to care about more expensive objects.  



i tried to do the whole social person thing too, smiling when people say vaguely funny things, responding when they ask you questions, drinking liquids when other people drink liquids.  it was ok while it lasted, but people mostly go on to make more people, or to make dollars, and obtain objects of increasing complexity.  so i feel that personing is kind of played out.  does anybody know of an alternative?  do you think I could get into being a rock, or some kind of bird?  flying seems like it might be fun.



i’ve considered the possibility that I might just be burnt out on personing. i’ve tried to take a break from it, but it’s difficult.  i’m wearing some kind of meat sack that needs to be fed a few times a day, it needs to be taken to the toilet regularly, and it requires a fair bit of effort to do any of these things, and you can’t stop unless you take the meat sack off.  so a break isn’t really an option.



i’ve often thought about trying a different angle on personing, like being some kind of violent or criminal person, or a healer, or a riverboat captain.  but all of those seem pretty unappealing - they’re either morally questionable, or they require years of effort to try personing in a new way that I might not even like when i get there.



i’ve also tried the whole relationship person thing - it definitely has some perks to share experiencing life with somebody else, but ultimately it seems to work out that the somebody else really wants to co-person - they want to person their way through things, and they expect you to person your own way as well.  which never really works, so it seems best to let them go their own way and find somebody else who they can co-person with.



so it seems that maybe personing is just not for me.  i’m not really against it in any way - it seems to be great for lots of people, but i don’t think i’m one of them.  it’s not that i don’t want to enjoy it, believe me, i would love to wake up in the morning and think to myself about all the great personing i’m going to do today.  i’m sure it’s great if that’s what you’re into, but i wonder if it’s just time that i try something different.

I've decided that the only way I'm going to get myself out of this shithole of a depression is by making myself a better person. I'm going to gain muscle, smile at strangers, talk to girls, pay better attention in class, and worry about myself more often. Even if I slip up, and fall back in that hole of sadness I can always say I gave it my best. Today's the day where I force myself to be what I've always wanted to be. Fuck you, depression.

I take a little too much cold medicine and BAM, back into the depression.  I get a little too little sleep and the dark cloud is back.  I exercise every day, I don't drink alcohol, I eat healthy, I take my fucking pill, it doesn't matter.  I'm fucking stuck with this bullshit brain and its fucked up chemistry.  



I look around at happy families gathering for brunch at the holidays and I seethe with jealousy and bitterness.  I don't feel able to give or receive love right now, just hatred and darkness.  



I can't leave my husband behind, I've promised him I wouldn't do that.  So now I'm angry that I can't even off myself.  Shitty day. 





Edit:  I do realize I sound like a spoiled child.  

P.S.:  Can't tell you how nice it is to see upvotes and responses to this, great knowing I'm not alone in the world.  Thank you!  



P.P.S.:  Thank you guys so much for the support, the confessions, the connections...  made my day and night so much better.

If you're going through a tough time with depression, know that somebody loves you and they wish that you would tell them because they would do anything in the world to at least be there for you, and hug, and reminisce about the good days. If you're going to do it, and nobody is going to be able to change your mind, please spend your last days with loved ones. They really wish it and it would help the ones you leave behind. Please





Edit: thank you all for your kind words. If anyone feels like maybe this helped them go another day living then I give a but of comfort in that. It's still very new and fresh. I don't know if it's appropriate or if I will want to do it. But I'm considering doing a post where I describe some of what happened and how he was found. I think if maybe someone hears what it's, like to find your family member, maybe they'll hold on an extra day.

I feel very unmasculine for posting this, but it's the truth. I just want to hold someone else, be a rock for them. They can help me when I'm down and when they're feeling down I can care for them. They can come and hold me on the days I don't have the strength to get out of bed. I hope one day someone will sweep me away. 



Ech, I feel weird for posting this. Curse my angsty, naive 19 year old brain. 



EDIT: Wow. Thank you guys. I'd hug every last one of you if I could.

It's honestly strange. You sit there, with the busiest mind, thinking a thousand different thoughts while trying to think of nothing at all. And meanwhile, your body is so tired, your muscles are sore, and you can't move. Whether or not you know you have to, doing more than shuffling a little is exhausting. It's upsetting too.  And confusing. And lots of feelings.



There's a million time-consuming things I have to accomplish within the hour, and I know that good stuff is happening when I'm done. But I can't move. I'll be unhappy if I'm late to get started, I'll be more unhappy when I'm rushing and can't enjoy anything. So that's what I'm doing. Sitting here, watching my cat purr and rub her head on my dresser, half-naked, and I can't get started.





TL;DR  Depression is some kind of way fucked up.



Edit:  Wow, you guys make me want to cry :]  I'm really happy that this helped some of you, and wanted to also say I'm here to talk or vent at or whatever.  This community is awesome and I love you guys.  You've been here for me more than once so please, come to me whenever you need it.

I have a childlike fascination with everything. I am delighted by the natural world - discovering a plant or beetle I've never seen before, walking in the forest, sitting by the ocean, gazing at the moon and stars, listening to music and language - these things fill me with such intense awe and joy. I feel a purpose and a connection to this planet.



50% of the Australian Barrier Reef died this Summer. A new coral reef was found in the Amazon but we're already dumping oil all fucking over it. We don't do fucking anything about suffering and inequality. We fill our brains with bullshit clickbait, disposable coffee cups and disposable everything, porn with fake pleasure and fake orgasms devoid of all emotion, fake conversations, fake personalities, fake emotions, instant gratification everything, bullshit news, bullshit fucking everything. 



How can humans be so great, so miraculous, so talented, so capable yet so completely selfish, shallow, robotic, consumerist? I feel like we are a shitty dystopian fantasy novel.



Everything I love is being destroyed.

I'm 19. I don't like birthdays. I'm so lonely. I have no friends. My sister said happy birthday. I went to my 2 summer classes, didn't talk to anyone, went home, watched a couple of episodes of The Office, sat in my bathroom, and cried.





I've never been in a relationship with a girl, and I'm a kissless virgin. This is because I have zero confidence and awfully low self-esteem. Nobody would ever be attracted to that kind of person. I hate myself so much. Getting older and marking down birthdays reminds me of how little I've accomplished in my life. I go to a community college, have no friends, and my social skills are almost unfixable. My mom died a year and a half ago because of liver cancer. I miss her. I cried a lot today.





Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. 







**EDIT**: I love all of you guys so much. Thanks again. All of your replies add up to more than all of my real-life/in-person birthday wishes over the past few years. Idk why I'm crying now. It's a weird kind of crying, like, happy crying. You guys are the best.

tl;dr: Practically walked in on my girlfriend with another guy. Found the freshly used condom in the trash. Much pain and misery ensues. 





We had been kind of bickering at each other yesterday morning. I was going to go over to her place in the afternoon. She was going snowshoeing and I had some errands to run so I went out to try to get my stuff done so I'd be able to go over there as soon as she was back. But, she got back and hour later than she said she was going to and I had already gone home. I wasn't going to go over then, and it really stung that she didn't seem to care. Maybe an hour or so later, I decided to go over. I had been kind of childish before and I thought I would go see her. I was having a rough day, and I really needed the comfort of seeing her, and I wanted to apologize for not coming over earlier. 



The entire drive across town, all I could think about was what I might find when I got there. The guy she went snowshoeing with was someone she had started hanging out with a lot lately. First he was going to show her around his gym because she wanted to start working out but was afraid to go in by herself and not know what she was doing. They never made it to the gym. They had lunch or coffee or something, and then a day later or something she mentioned that he had come over there. To the apartment she had been madly cleaning for the last week. 



I had been having some trust issues with her for a couple of months. She had asked me how I would feel if we had an open relationship because she wanted to try things with other people. I was the only one she had ever had sex with, so I certainly understand that desire, but it just wasn't something I knew I could handle. She wanted to be able to go fuck other guys, with no strings attached, just to see what it was like. She wanted a threesome with two guys. That was a big fantasy for her. I was working on adjusting my mindset. I wanted to be supportive and open to new things. I just needed to get the jealousy under control. And I told her that. It was something I was trying to learn to accept. I didn't want to keep her from having those experiences. I am so much older than she is, I've had some experience with other people. I didn't want to deprive her of that experience, but I needed some time to adjust to the idea. 



I parked on the street near her apartment. I knocked lightly on the door and tried to open it, but it was locked. There is a keypad to unlock the door, so I would have been able to just let myself in as long as she didn't have the chain on. But she didn't have the chain on. She put it on as soon as she realized it was me. She said "fuck", and then I thought I heard whispers. But I didn't want that to be true, so I didn't really hear them.



For a few minutes she kept telling me to go away. At first, there was terror, and fear, in her voice. She knew she had been caught. But, she quickly came up with a story that she was mad at me, and was sure that I had just come over there to fight with her about something. She just said she didn't want to talk to me. 



I finally gave up. I walked back to my car and just started balling. I started to text her. She just kept saying that she didn't want to see me. And suddenly she asked where I was. I told her I was in my car, and she told me to come in. She had figured out a way to sneak him out. There was a second door in her apartment that went to the basement and the laundry, but there was an exit to the outside that way too. I went in and she was standing there in the living room. I was glad she had finally let me in, but I was still looking around at everything suspiciously. The things she usually kept sitting in front of the basement door where not quite in their usual place. But I didn't want to see it. I took off my shoes and my coat, and I walked over to her and embraced her. I was so madly in love with her, I was just blind to what was going on around me. 



She started telling me something about the cat or something, and led me into the kitchen. There was no reason to go in there. Afterwards, of course, I realized she was giving him time to escape where I wouldn't see him through the window. 



She invited me in her room. We usually spend our time there cuddled up in bed. The pillows were arranged, one next to the other. I could see, what I later realized was panic in her face when she saw the stains of her own wetness on the sheets. I saw them. But I still didn't see them. 



We talked and cried and went on about how hard it was for us, that we couldn't be together as much as we wanted. How she felt like she was giving up her dreams for me. She didn't apply for some summer internships out of state, she didn't apply to any other colleges. And in there somewhere, left unsaid, but still heard, that she was giving up on a host of sexual experiences that she longed to have. That she wasn't really giving up afterall. 



I laid there in bed with her. It makes my skin crawl, and I want to vomit. But we laid there and talked and cried. She climbed over me to grab a kleenex. Either she realized that the used condom or wrapper was still sitting on the top of the garbage can, or maybe had just been sitting on the bedside table. It did strike me as odd that she didn't just ask me to hand the tissues to her. But as she straddled me, I declined to care. 



We talked and it seemed we had worked things out. Things had been rocky for us for months, partly because I hadn't really trusted her for some time. But I had written it all off to my depression and my anxiety. I just called those thoughts my demons.



She had to go to work, so she got ready. She stood there in front of me and changed her shirt. She had dressed in a hurry obviously so she was only wearing a tank top and a pair of sweats with nothing underneath. She snuck around the corner to pull off her pants and put some underwear on. I don't know if she didn't want me to see that she wasn't wearing any, or what exactly she was hiding from me then. That wasn't a usual thing for her to do. 



When she was ready, I was going to give her a lift to work. She always just walked. It wasn't far. I kissed her. I kept my lips on hers and I could feel her tense. I kissed her again, but now she had lowered her head to avoid it somewhat. 



I took her to work. She was texted furiously as we drove. I can only assume to him. To fill him in on what happened after he left. Maybe to tell him that I hadn't suspected anything. But, I suspected everything. 



I pulled away from the parking lot and went straight back to her apartment. I had bought her a few things on my errands earlier that day and I had forgotten to give them to her. I wanted to look around. I wanted to find nothing so desperately. But, I knew exactly what I was looking for. I looked the the kitchen garbage can first. The least likely place, but I still was hoping I would find anything. I had to check the small can in the bedroom. I picked the two wadded tissues off the top and saw the gold wrapper. It still didn't convince me. Maybe she was just playing around with one. She did that from time to time. Put one on a toy or something. I reached in and pulled it out. A condom, heavy and full of cum. At that moment, I died. 



I sent her a text, to tell her that I had gone back into her apartment, that I had looked in the trash. I didn't expect her to get it unless she had a break in a few hours, or 6 hours later at the end of her shift. But my phone notifies me when she sees my texts. I sent three messages to her. Each one was seen, with no reply. Eventually she write back something about that she was sorry. Then that she had left work, that she had thrown up. She asked for some confirmation that I wasn't going to hurt myself. I've attempted it, although feebly once before. She tried to call, and I rejected it. 



The last I heard was text a few hours later. Simply, "Be well,...". The ellipsis was replaced by her pet name for me. 



I have no one I can talk to about any of this. I didn't sleep much last night. I woke up thinking it was much later, but I had only managed to stay asleep for an hour. I wrote her a rather lengthy email. I needed to explain everything I saw. How much I had wanted it to be simply my demons. How angry and hurt I am. I needed her to understand what she did. She never gave me any words of remorse. The only sorry, was not for what she had done, but that she hadn't done a better job of keeping it from me. 



I am lost. directionless, floating in an abyss. I am an empty shell. I feel completely devoid of all life. I am already dead. My body just has not caught up to this fact yet. I don't want to die. I want to turn it off. 



The worst part is that I could forgive her. I love her. I'm really far less hurt that I feel I should be. But I could never trust her again. 





I know how things go on this sub. I don't expect any comments. Just a note to say you listened would be nice.

Update: I want to thank all of you for all of your kind words. You should know that we have split up. Our relationship had been rocky for several months. It was bound to end. I just wouldn't let it go. I'm so much older than her, and she has a lot of growing up to do. She's not ready for me yet. I went to work today. I made someone come with me on my route. I couldn't be alone. I was afraid I'd steer myself into an oncoming truck. I've had the last hour at home by myself. We talked a little this morning. I want to be her friend, even though she did this horrible thing to me. I've been where she is today. Hell, I've been where I am now before. More than once. I sure know how to pick them. (All the more reason that it is so hard not to blame myself though. Four times I've been through this.) Part of me still cares and wants to help her figure it out without having to go through the decade of pain and misery that I experienced trying to figure out life for myself. I need some time away. A little time to heal. A little time to detach. I don't think that's ever really going to work though. Keep reading and you'll find out what I just found out. 



I asked her about STD's just now. She's dancing around the question a little. That's not very promising. Her and I hadn't done anything before she hooked up with this guy, but she apparently blew some other guy a few weeks ago. I'll have to go get tested then. I feel like I'm going to be sick. 



I'm home by myself now. I stayed at work just hanging around for several hours so I didn't have to come home and be alone. I rescheduled a job interview I had tomorrow so I could finally have a real, full-time job after being unemployed or under-employed for several months. I talked to my mom on the phone, but I couldn't bring myself to mention anything. Someone is here now so I don't have to sit here alone. I think I'll be ok.



I love you all. Thank you.

Update 2: I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone. I'll keep trying. Thank you all so much. I'm trying very hard to be bigger than all this. Right now, I just feel so sorry for her. She's just a depraved little girl who has to whore herself out in order to feel good about herself. It makes me very sad for her. She could be so much more. 



I've got my meds in order again too. I ran out and went a few days before I could get a refill. Being off the meds for a few days seriously fucks with me.

Dear friends and family,



By some weird error I managed to live past my expiration date. I should of killed myself long ago. I'm so sorry [sister]. I love you. [Ex], you broke my heart. Why? 



Well goodbye everyone.



-[my name]







This was from like two years ago. After I made the not I sat in my room for a while and called suicide hotline and they managed to talk me out of it and then I stashed my journal away and I forgot about it until this post. I'm fine by the way it's just weird seeing something that isn't me anymore.

Like the title says. My girlfriend cheated on me. Three of my family members were killed in a car crash, and a person who decided to help me with a career died of an aneurysm. I struggled with depression and self-harm earlier in my life. And I just need someone to tell me it's alright. 



Edit: to everyone who replied. Thank you. Your messages and support have been amazing. I'm going to therapy this coming monday and I thank you all for helping get on the path to help myself.

I want to cuddle with someone who I love, and who loves me. I want to feel safe and protected from the world for at least once in my life. I want to forget, even if just for a little while. I want to let someone in. I want to finally let it all out. I want to feel something other than nothing. I want intimacy.



I'm tired.

I just found out from a very close friend that my girlfriend of a year and a half is dead. She committed suicide by drinking poison. I don't know how to deal with this right now. I'm having a extremely hard time accepting that she's gone. I'm just having a mental breakdown.

I was thinking this morning about how I don't feel like I think i'm supposed to in general... and it occurred to me that, when I think of how a person is supposed to feel you might rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, from "Sad to Happy".



But if I were to put how I feel in general on a scale of 1 to 10, that scale is from "Sad to Distracted".



Even when I'm not sad, I'm not happy, it's more like I'm just distracted from being sad by being busy or something.





I'm curious if anyone else feels the same way.

I'm most myself when I'm out on my own, on the road, listening to my country music. I'm able to be myself, I'm typically not anxious, and I don't have any worries on my mind. But at the same time I have 0 motivation to leave the house and go do stuff. I hate it so much.

I noticed that if someone is kind to me, I feel like I didn't deserve it. It makes me feel nervous. It starts with simple things, like at work, when a colleague does a favor for me, I always feel like I'm causing him trouble or I'm wasting his time.



Or when customers give me tip, I seriously would like to give it back to them immediately.



A few days ago, the cops pulled me over, I was probably going a little too fast, but they were super nice and even cracked some jokes, they just wanted to see if everything's alright, they were just randomly checking cars. I felt like I didn't deserve this kind behavior from an authority.





It's even worse with affection. When good things happen, like a girl showing me affection, I feel like they're just pitying me. During depressive episodes, I feel ugly and unlovable. I find myself denying the fact that genuinely good things can actually happen in life.



It seems like it's much easier for me to handle shitty and bad circumstances; bad things happening, catastrophes, death...I would embrace the apocalypse if it happened right now.

It's a term I coined to try to explain what I've been feeling. I don't think I could ever put a gun to my head or hang myself, more active things, so instead, I just do nothing. I spend time online, shut myself off from everyone, live in my own little world. I don't look for a job, don't try to better myself, in a hope that passively, my world will fall down around me somehow, and will take me with it.



Anybody else relate to this?



Edit: Wow, so many replies, many of them very sad and worrisome. If anyone wants to talk, feel free to PM me. Maybe we could start some sort of group chat.

Finally, a new start for me. A new reason to have hope. It took me a few months, but I finally got a job at a doctor's office. I'm pretty pumped. 



I'm excited. And I'm going back to the gym.





Don't give up, people!

I'm lost. I'm so fucking lost. He was perfectly fine until just a few weeks ago. I moved to the other side of the country a few weeks ago.

I didn't know it was the last time I'd ever see him. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm a fucking idiot for not staying home.

I found out today after my mom called me crying while I was in class and I had a full on breakdown at school. 

He was the only thing who I felt genuinely appriciated and needed me. It's dumb right? 

I can't stop crying. I miss you so much, you big baby. 



I hope you're okay now, wherever you are.

i skipped school because i woke up so depressed it felt like my soul was being sucked into a vacuum, so i went into the bathroom and sat in the shower for two hours dissociating and when my mom finally made me get out because "you cant just sit in the shower all day" so i crawled under the blanket in my dark room without even bothering to get dressed and slept until 3pm.



i havent eaten anything today, other than a candy bar because it was the only edible thing in my room and my will to not leave my room and face any part of the world that exists outside of it (even if it's just my kitchen) is stronger than my appetite (which is nonexistent when i feel this fucking horrible anyway)



but i drank a bottle of water. kind of pathetic that the dark hole that im trapped in has become so low that just drinking water is an accomplishment. maybe tomorrow ill accomplish brushing my teeth.



edit: i fucking love you guys

Does anyone else dread being asked that question?



I work in a job where I meet with outside vendors fairly often. Usually, they take me and a few coworkers out to lunch. We talk about some work related things, but the conversation inevitably drifts to personal life topics. Mr. Salesrepguy will ask us what our hobbies are outside work.



 My coworkers will go "Oh, I do a lot of hunting, and I go dirtbiking every other weekend" or "I compete in iron man competitions and train for 3 hours a day" or "I play in a local softball league and a few of my buddies are in a band."



Me? "Uh... just... y'know. Hang out. And... er... stuff." Because I have no hobbies. Or friends. My time outside of work is spent pretty much exclusively sitting around and surfing reddit, watching TV, and thinking about how much I hate myself and how nice it would be to kill myself.  



Other questions I hate:



"So, are you married?" No. I'm the only one of my coworkers who isn't, except for the one guy who has a new girlfriend every month. I'm 24 and have never been in a relationship, mainly because I can't imagine anyone wanting to date me.



"So, any big plans for the weekend?" Yeah. Wake up around 9, but be unable to build up the motivation to actually get out of bed until at least noon. After which point, I'll sit on the couch instead, reading reddit and watching TV to distract myself from how much I hate myself. I'll think about cleaning the pile of dishes that's been sitting in my sink for at least a week, but I won't actually do it. Oh, and I won't shower either, and may not even put on clothes.

You hate yourself. You hate yourself so much you don't even care that you hate yourself. The fact that you're always thinking about your own death doesn't worry you, because in your eyes you're such a piece of garbage it doesn't matter. You hate yourself so much it's not even a feeling, it just is a fact of life. It's like when you spill fruit punch on the carpet, and it just becomes a part of the scenery, so that three years later when someone comes over (why anyone would want to, who fucking knows) and points it out, you're surprised. That stain of self loathing, of always wanting to die but not being able to find the motivation to actually do anything about it so you just eat chips, has just become so common to you that you forget that most people don't have half a gallon of dried Kool Aid on the living room floor, that people can actually taste food and get out of bed and that they don't cry because they simply exist.



You always wonder why bad guys in movies want so desperately to stay alive, especially when their plans fail and all is lost, because why does it even matter at that point? Why do they care if they die? And you WOULD be moved by the irony that the villains in movies place more value on life than you do on your own, but the thought is quickly replaced by the swell idea of just kind of disappearing forever, so you don't have to deal with all the mess of living or dying. In the back of your mind you wish you could stop drowning in literally any responsibility you have, but after swimming upstream so long to just put on pants and get out the door late, if even at all, all you can really do is just light the third cigarette in a row. Sometimes you feel stimulation, whenever your unfortunate survival instincts kick in and you have to drag your sad ass to the bathroom or to get any sort of liquid because your throat is so dry. When did you get so thirsty? You've gained 40 pounds you worked so hard to lose, but you're probably going to ruin your life in the next few days somehow anyways, because you always find something good to ruin, and chex mix is in arm's length so you just eat a few until you realize the whole bag is gone. You start to feel guilty, but then you remember you hated yourself just as much 4 pants sizes ago. 



But the worst part is that you're trying. You're trying SO HARD. I must just be lazy, right? Surely everyone else feels like this too, right? Being terrified of everything to the point where running into people you know makes you physically unable to breathe is normal, right? Isn't everyone else's stomach in so many knots from the stress of self-loathing that you could turn it in for a merit badge? But then doesn't that just make you an apathetic failure? Shit, it's 7:30? You were supposed to call your therapist to make an appointment. Your psychologist who won't refill your useless antidepressants won't call you back. All the offices are closed now, so you are going to have to call back tomorrow. 



So you crawl into bed. You know you're going to sleep through your classes but you turn your alarms on anyway, just to wake up 12 hours later to turn them off after 2 hours of screeching at you, and the first thing that you think when you open your eyes is how much you hate yourself.

First of all, I am making this post as more of a rant than a cry for help because i'm pretty sure I can guess all of the advice I will receive. I just have no one to talk to, and I really need to rant.



To begin, I have been depressed for the better part of 4 years. I just graduated college and I feel like I learned nothing. And that I am so completely unprepared for the real world that I don't even know what job I would want to apply for. I really want to enlist in the army infantry, but when I told my parents about considering it, I received no support from them (which is understandable).

I don't socialize with new people. During the past year at college, I have gone out to the bars one time with my friends. My social anxiety goes through the roof whenever I go out anywhere, so I just decide to embrace being the loner I am by staying at my place night after night. Girls are non-existent in my life. I don't go out, so I never give myself the chance to meet girls. I don't talk to them, and they don't talk to me. Shit, even my "friends" don't talk to me or even send me a text asking how I have been. My last girlfriend was in my freshman year of college, and she was my absolute best friend. I told her every little "secret" I had, and didn't hold back any details of my life. And she ended up dumping me after she had enough of my sadness, and "didn't want to be dragged down with me". So after that experience, I haven't allowed myself to get close to anyone (including both family and friends).

Right now I feel boxed in and that there is no escape from my own personal on-earth hell that I have created for myself. I want to get professional help. But I am afraid to even talk to my parents about considering it because that means that I have to tell them the truth about my life. How the "happy face" I put on throughout the past 4 years and all of the happy stories were all a lie just so that they wouldn't freak out. I feel like a failure, but I have no motivation to do better. I no longer have the confidence or motivation to take necessary risks to further myself in life. I feel sad, lonely, and lost. I am hopeless.



**EDIT:** Wow, this received so much more attention than I anticipated! Thank you all so much for your kind words, personal messages, and hugs =]  It might not seem like much, but knowing that this many people are listening to me and actually offering help and support means **SO** much to me. Reading all of your replies has brought me to tears and I hope that I can use/apply everything you all have told me to better myself and my outlook on life. I already love this community and I will make sure to keep in contact with those who have asked! You all are the best and I am sending hugs back to all of you =]

One minute you feel fine, and then a tiny thing, a thought, a conversation, can remind you of how terrible you feel, and sink you right back down into that dark place. And it always feels so selfish and stupid, like throwing a temper tantrum. It's like: "I was feeling good before but one little thing made me sad again, I don't have any right to feel this way." I feel like I should only feel sad if something really bad happens, not just because the good mood went away, or something a bit off happened. I hate it. I feel so selfish and childish and terrible. How do you deal with this?

So a few weeks ago, I told a friend about my depression, we talked about it for a few hours, she was extremely surprised, and had a lot of questions. She said I could call her at whatever time I wanted, even if it was 03:00, just to talk to her about it. I just avoid the topic because I always feel like I'm bothering her, ahe asked me this week how I was dealing with it. I told her it wasn't going well, and she again said I could call her whenever I like. Every time I get my phone to call her, I convince myself otherwise, because I think I'll just be annoying her and dragging her down with me. Does anyone else avoid talking to people in these situations?

For the first time in a long career of being a depressed human being, I was told "It gets better" un-ironically during an otherwise constructive conversation. It made my face flush and I immediately had the urge to end the conversation. So I did. And now I feel like an ass.



The phrase "it gets better" doesn't seem terrible at face value. I mean, it really isn't terrible. But I feel as though in past years, at least in the US, there has been a rather prolific ad/PSA campaign based around the phrase "it gets better". It feels contrived and inauthentic. It's the poor man's way of saying "I get what you're saying, but I don't have the emotional capacity to support you right now". And that's fine, if that is the purpose it's supposed to serve. It's a slogan, a catch-phrase, and not an effective means of providing emotional support or insight. It's the "Got Milk?" or "Just do it!" of depression support advocates. I'm genuinely not sure what aspect of depression it is supposed to hint at, aside from perhaps the small percentage of MDD/GAD sufferers that feel drive toward self harm and suicide - and even then, I think would hate to hear this if I were in that position. 



**Does anyone feel the same way? Is there perhaps any other phrase or word that "triggers" (for lack of a better word) anger or negative feelings relating to depression/anxiety?**



To keep this from being an entirely negative discussion, feel free to add and discuss the aspects of your treatment plan that you've had success with. For me, after years of genuinely perfectionist approach to lifestyle (diet, exercise, sleep), beginning a regime of SSRI in the form of Lexapro was the first thing that made me feel as though my situation was improving.



Best of luck, everyone. I just felt as though this was the proper place to share my negative outlook and maybe get some feedback.

That was my gpa for this semester. I failed all my classes with 3 D's and an F. I've cried every night because I am such a screw up. I haven't even told my parents because I am so dissapointed in myself. I failed the exact same classes last semester too.



Why can't I get my shit together? Why can't I stop procrastinating? Why do I always whine on the internet and can't just do these things?



I've wasted about 25k on a year of education. I've ruined my 4 year graduation plan. I am such a fuck up. Why can't I just be happy and friends. Why am I such a royal fuckup with everything I do. 



Every night I wish I could turn back time and fix all this. I'm 21 and wasted my entire life. I've got no hope and no future. I have such low self-esteem and confidence that I just want to go far away.

Just a thought I had a while ago that I like to point out. I'm not saying there's no value in hard work, but I'm really sick of the feel-good bullshit that we get from pop culture about how everyone's a winner, we're all special, hard work always pays off, etc etc... I had passions in life that I gave 110%, spending absolutely all of my time on them, and they amounted to absolutely nothing. I have severe limitations that others don't have. I'm not going to be successful and I understand that. I'm honestly getting sick of being told otherwise.

I've had an epiphany about my anxiety and depression. Most of my anxiety comes from a fear of rejection, a fear of being judged and a fear of being made fun of, which in turn makes me depressed because I feel like I can't talk to anyone, especially females. But I came to a realization of how I can use this to my advantage and loophole my own depression and anxiety...By using my depression and anxiety against itself. If I'm already convinced that I'm going to be made fun of, rejected or judged...Then fuck it, why not go for it? I may as well just go talk to the cute Asian girl at the store. I can't fail my own expectations because my expectation is to fail...So what will happen? Either it will go as expected or better than expected. You can't fail your expectations when you already expect to fail, so fuck it, I say go for it. My own fear and anxiety is working against itself.



I'm not sure if this will work for others but it's certainly something to think about.

Does anyone else sleep like 15+ hours a day as an escape?



During the week, I work a desk job and during lunch I go in my car to sleep for an hour.  I feel like I can't focus on work, and I'm always online reading subreddits about depression/breakups/no-contact.  I'm recently getting over a breakup from a 4.5 year relationship (I was the dumpee) and am now in a friends with benefits situation, but I'm developing feelings. This is just adding fuel to the fire, I know, but I have always relied on a guy to make me happy, and as someone being depressed I think that short term happiness is more desirable than thinking in the long term.  



I still live at home and have about 2 friends.  I work all week looking forward to the weekend just to sleep all day.  I take naps to escape the feeling of loneliness/unhappiness and when I wake up I check my phone.  If it's not from my 'friend with benefits' I become more sad and just go back to bed hoping when I wake up the next time I'll have a text from him.



This is a horrible way to live life.  I'm 23 years old, this should be the time where I'm hanging out with friends / exercising / spending time with family / going on dates.  I've tried all those things but honestly I'd rather be sleeping ...



Does anyone else have similar habits?

This is one of the best descriptions of depression I've ever read:



[Three Things You May Not Get About the Aaron Swartz Case](http://www.popehat.com/2013/03/24/three-things-you-may-not-get-about-the-aaron-swartz-case/)



I plan on sharing this with family and friends that do not really understand what it means to suffer from clinical depression, to those who urge you to just snap out of it.



Click through to read the full article but here's a snippet:



> Depression is not like sadness. Everyone has been sad. Everyone has been depressed on one occasion or another. But clinical depression is something else entirely.



> What is it like?



> Forgive me, but I'd like for you to imagine the worst day of your life. Maybe someone you love was killed in an accident. Maybe a loved one got a terrifying diagnosis. Maybe you abruptly lost a job you need to support your family. Maybe you caught your husband or wife cheating on you. Maybe you found out your son or daughter is addicted to drugs. Maybe you experienced some dreadful public humiliation.



> Remember how that felt, at the worst part of that day? Now imagine you feel that way most of the time, for months at a time.



> Think of the most stressed and worried you have ever been in your life, and then imagine that your stomach feels like that all the time.



> Imagine that you are constantly gripped with overwhelming feelings of dread and crushing hopelessness — irrational, not governed by real risks or challenges, but still inexorable.



> Imagine that you are often fatigued to the point of weakness and irritability because you can't get to sleep until late at night, or because your mind consistently shakes you awake at four in the morning, racing with worry about the day's activities as your stomach roils and knots.



> Imagine that most social interactions become painful, the cause of nameless dread. Imagine that when the phone rings or your computer dings with a new email you get a short, hot, foul shot of adrenaline, sizzling in your fingertips and bitter in your mouth.



> Imagine that, however much you understand the causes of these symptoms intellectually, no matter how well you know that you are fully capable of meeting the challenges you face and surviving them, no matter how well you grasp that these feelings are a symptom of a disease, you can't stop feeling this way.



> Imagine that you have moments — maybe even minutes — where you forget how you feel, but those moments are almost worse, because when they end and you remember the feelings rush back in like a dark tide that much more painfully.



> Imagine that you know you should talk to someone about how you feel — but you can't bring yourself to do so. Have you ever been so nauseated — from illness or from drinking — that you can't bear for someone to touch you or talk to you? Imagine feeling like that — that the human interactions that might ease the pain are too painful to endure, that every word on the subject is a blow.



> After a while, this wears you down a bit.

Like the real laugh, from the heart... and its usually about something stupid but it feel so good and you stop and think of how long its been since that happened, and how you cant imagine that people are laughing and feeling like this all the time? 



When I get where I'm going I'm going to laugh and smile like that every day, and its going to be amazing.

And did something out of the ordinary. I jumped in puddles and ran in tall grass in my sneakers. And truth be told, the cold water on my feet and legs, the rain in my face, the calm sound of rain hitting trees.. is more powerful than my thoughts of killing myself. Way more powerful. I mean, if I end it, when will I ever experience this again?

Ok, this is my first post on Reddit. I don't know how to start this or if anyone will care. But here goes nothing.



I've had depression for 5 years now. Each and every year getting progressively worse, it's tearing me up inside. It's gotten to a point where my heart aches every night and it hurts so much. Most of the time I feel like a burden towards others. I have nothing to offer and I have such a blank and boring personality. Everyone around me is so full of talent and have such colourful and interesting personalities.



I feel like a nobody. I feel like I don't exist. I regret being born. I feel ostracised, no one ever messages me or even bothers to reply, I feel like the third wheel of every group chat and I don't know why all these things happen. Why do bad things happen to good people? All I've ever done is help others and I'm rewarded with loneliness and an inferiority complex. Gee thanks.



I'd never kill myself. Ever. But a thought in the back of my mind always considers it an option.



I guess what I'm trying to say is that I just want to feel like I exist again, I want to feel like I matter to someone, I need affection. There is just so much I've bottled up for so long that I desperately needed a release. I don't know if anyone will ever see or read this; but if you did...



Thank you.

It is the best time of the day, because even though most of my dreams are nightmares there is still more feeling in them than I get in a normal day. It also is safe, and comforting. People might hate and judge you for not working hard enough, but everyone needs sleep. 



Unfortunately, it is also the worst time of day because I have to wake up and face my fears as a new day begins.

I don't fear sadness. In the distress of sadness, despite the likelihood of negative coping, I still seek out ways to recover. 



I fear apathy. The apathy that leaves you paralyzed as you watch your life fall apart. The apathy that leaves you content to watch yourself drown from the futility of breathing in, the desire to drift away from the things that keep you living: wishing that family and friends would forget you. You begin realize what a burden you are, people's live would be better without you. You begin to find peace while thinking of ways to leave this life, only to become angered when you're unable to let go: stuck starting at a noose or a bottle of pills, stuck standing on the ledge unable to step off yet unable to step away: many aren't as lucky.



I don't fear feeling sad, I fear the apathy that keeps me from feeling anything besides the emptiness.The apathy that strips away the memories of ever having felt at all.

We have been together for 4 years, married for one, and we have a beautiful baby girl. I loved him with my whole heart, and I know he loved us both so much. It might be hard to think that's true after my story, but he was so proud of us both and he was so happy the day we got married. He was always so sure about us.



He is ex-military and struggled with depression and suicide before I met him.



Last year in March I discovered that he had been carrying on an affair with my sister almost from the time we started dating. My sister is very young, 19, at the time. He was 30. They didn't have sex, but making out and petting seemed to be happening. It was so disgusting, I didn't know what to think. Apparently my sister initiated it at first, and he kept at it too. 



I loved him so, and he was in so much pain about what he had done, that we patched things up. Unfortunately, we ended up living at my parents house where my sister lives too for about 8 months waiting for our new house to be fixed. He also had some of the same classes with her. I know this sounds so inappropriate, but I just so desperately wanted to fix the situation, have them transform their relationship into the brother and sister they should have been, and save my beloved little family.



My husband's sister, who originally revealed all these details to me, was angry and shocked at her brother, but she also assigns a lot of blame to my sister who she says didn't understand how delicate her brother is and that my sister played "head games" with him, leading him on at first, and then, after it all came out, my sister blamed him largely for what had happened and joined me in "punishing" my husband.



He couldn't move on from her. He kept trying to text her (mostly chit chat, but just a lot) and hang out with her, and she treated him at arms length, not responding to many of his texts. Truth be told she treated him rather chillily, and said she was trying to do the right thing by shutting him down. He asked her to come talk to him about things once somewhere, and when she arrived, she says that he tried to kiss her, and so she left, just driving off.



He confided in me sometimes. He would say how confused he was about her. Sometimes he seemed to be moving on and could see she was just young and starving for attention, so she tried to get it from every guy she could. He was still so jealous about her hanging out with other guys. Sometimes he would say that he felt crazy and that he felt like it had all been so meaningless because she denied having ever had real feelings for him--like he would have felt better if they had truly had something together that just didn't work out or something.



I had a really hard time with all this. I sometimes tried to listen and told him sometimes that it probably would hurt me, but that I would rather hear it and give him someone who would listen to him. He wanted someone to talk to and didn't feel like he could talk to anyone. I tried to build him up most of the time and be as understanding as I could. I tried to give him advice and talk him through it. I always hated to see him in pain so much.



But I also dumped my feelings on to him quite a lot too. Just spewing out my hurt and low self esteem and how I felt like our relationship had been a lie. I often doubted that he loved me if he had done such a thing. I did that often. I was going through so much, and I leaned on him heavily. I would cry sometimes at night in bed together and would talk for hours and text him about how I felt.



Meanwhile, he was working very hard on our new house and doing very well in school. He worked so hard!



The last week he was alive, I felt neglected. He seemed to be uninterested in hanging out with me in my opinion. I told him how I felt, but it didn't seem to change. He said that he was working on the house so we could be together all the time, but I just was hurt when he'd come home and hop on the computer or want to go hang out with the rest of my family instead. I knew he was down, but we've been through some tough times before.



The day he died, we had a big fight over text. I told him I was not doing well and launched into a whole explanation about how he should pull his head out of this fantasy he had, and that my sister was immature and had her own problems and that he had a woman for a wife who shared his hopes and dreams. I started the conversation well, even suggesting a counselor for him maybe, or something like that. But then I made the terrible mistake of asking him if he would leave me for her if she returned his feelings. His response was "probably, and I don't know how to deal with that." I just lost it. I told him I wanted to split up, sell our house, that I didn't want anything to do with him, and how could he say that to me. He said "I don't know. I love you so ****ing much." I cursed him and cursed him. And then he went silent. He posted a goodbye line on FB and I had an instant fear. I rushed over to where he was in my dad's car, but it was too late. He had shot himself in our car. I held his unconscious but still breathing body until the paramedics came.



I know he did me so many wrongs, but he was also this awesome, high functioning person who so many looked up to. He was the kind of person who would go out of his way to help people. He was talented, smart, funny, handsome, and I doted on him. He loved his baby girl so very much. But, he had this deep inner feeling of failure and was so resigned to being a piece of **** in his own mind it seemed like.



I feel horrendous. I feel like I killed him at the end, after so many years of showering him with love. It's so unfair that our story ended this way. I spent so much time building him up and helping him get back in school. He was a wonderful father. I wish more than anything I had waited to say the things I did to his face, and that he had come home that night like normal. He was so confused and stubborn, and maybe he would have never changed, but…still. I loved him with my whole heart and I loved to be with him. I feel horrible that I moved us to this area where he was so bored and hated the terrain and maybe that made him fixate on my sister more than ever. He just seemed to be doing so well, and we were almost in our house, that we had worked so hard for.



I miss him. Both my sister and I are just devastated. We miss his silly jokes and funny laugh and ineptness. He isn't here anymore. He was a pain in the *** and we got frustrated with his inappropriate actions, but we both cared about him. It's so painful not having him around anymore.



I feel like I should have seen this coming because he would talk about being suicidal before (and I would hug him and say oh no, please never do that) and I knew he was depressed that week. I kick myself so hard for texting instead of waiting to speak face to face. I should have known better--that wasn't right!!



I know it's so typical, but I feel like there is no joy left in life. I can't even look at my daughter without being sad. She has no Daddy and she looks just like him. He was in so much pain and I let him down--I always wanted to be there for him and I wasn't that day. I feel like 4 years of love and support were just down the drain in one instant and I broke his heart. I just want him back so bad.

"It could always be worse" "At least you aren't a child in a third world country" "At least you aren't dying'.........



FUCK ALL OF YOU! You have NO idea what true depression feels like. You have NO idea what it is like to wake up every morning hoping to die in a freak accident because "committing suicide would be unfair to the people who *love* you." The people who love you only want you to live so they don't feel guilty when you fucking die. I'm pretty sure after 8 years of chronic depression I know whether things will fucking get better or not...



I know what physical pain feels like and I would take breaking my leg over depression any day of the week. 



Depression isn't merely sadness. It is a gnawing hatred for your self that attacks your mind every minute with the power of 1000 suns. Depression is lying in bed and taking a shower once a month because personal hygiene is reserved for those who love and respect themselves. 



If you EVER try to cheer up a depressed person by saying it "could be worse" then FUCK YOU!!!!!!

"Part of the problem with the word *disabilities* is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities."

#Wall Of Text Warning 



I posted a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/471h1h/ive_started_clearing_out_my_social_media_in/. 

 You all really came through and I really appreciate every message and reply you all took the time out of your day to compose and send me. You are all so amazing. I really wasn't expecting much.



On the day that I posted,  I did go through with scrubbing most of my social media clean. I thought that maybe smoking some weed and enjoying the nice weather outside would help. So i tried that, but the whole walk I just cried and did not feel any kind of better, and had to go back home to put my makeup on again because it washed away. So then I went to a ramp near the highway, ready to jump into traffic. But I just stood there. I stood there looking into traffic for about 20 minutes, and then decided to check my messages. They were so personal and thoughtful. I decided that I was going to give life another shot the next day, and if it didn't work out, then I guess that was it.



The next day, I decided I was going to do something different. Got up 2 and half hours earlier than usual,  treated myself to a nail appointment, then, instead of taking a cab to work, I took a bus I had never taken before. Just a random bus, to see different people and places. And it was so surreal to go through parts of a city I've lived in my whole life that I've never really seen. I didn't even know habidasheries were still a thing, but I [saw one]( http://i.imgur.com/42L38l6.jpg) . I also took a break from social media, just to be with myself and my thoughts. 



These last couple days have been improvements, and I feel like I'll be okay for awhile. I have a fun day planned for myself and it'll be nice out. I just wanted to let you all know that I'm okay and you all are a part of that happening. 



So TL; DR: I'm okay, I feel okay, and I thank you all for reaching out to me, even though I didn't respond to many, and I apologize for that and any worry I caused :)

I took a medical leave of absence from work for depression/anxiety and I was in and out of my therapist's office all of last week and the start of this week.  On Monday my therapist kept coughing a lot and clearing her throat and blamed it on seasonal allergies – which I found strange at this time of year.  Today I received a call from the counseling center.  The woman on the phone said she wanted to discuss my next appointment with my therapist.  I was kind of annoyed because my therapist had previously rescheduled on me a handful of times over the last few months and my work schedule makes it difficult to figure out.



Anyway, the woman hesitated before saying that my therapist had passed away.  I instantly just had a head full of bees and confusion.  I asked what happened and she said my therapist had respiratory issues and had gone into cardiac arrest on Monday and been taken off life support that day (yesterday).  I was just in complete shock.  I still am.  The woman continued to talk about how my therapist was the only one who accepted my insurance and would I be interested in being reassigned therapists on a sliding fee scale?  I couldn't believe she was just carrying on in this business-like tone like she hadn't dropped this bomb on me.  I mumbled something and got off the phone.



My therapist was only 33.  I'm 27.  She went into cardiac arrest HOURS after our appointment.  I've been seeing her for a long time.  She has kids and a husband.  I've been browsing /r/relationships over the last few hours just up with insomnia and every time someone mentions going to a therapist, my head just hurts all over again.  I've only experienced death a few times over my lifetime and this was just so unexpected and still doesn't seem real.  I know we had a professional relationship but I just am feeling so much grief and shock.  Grief and shock like one would discuss with their therapist.  I just don't even know.  I feel so stupid for all my trivial little complaints in her office over the last few weeks.  I KNOW that was her job and I couldn't have predicted her dying, but it seems so petty in retrospect to complain for our entire last session about hating my job, not knowing she would be dead hours later.

I feel like absolute shit today. I thought I was heading in the right direction but recently I've got much worse. Feeling like you're sliding back into severe depression is pretty fucking crap. I rarely get out of the house, partly because my sleep pattern is so bizarre. In the past I've found going for a wander in the evening can be helpful. I'll be going out anyway but if anyone wants to join me you're welcome to, whoever you are. 



Probably not going to get a response, but hey it's worth a shot. *(UK by the way, not Cardiff in the US/Canada/Australia)*



Edit: I have returned. No one joined me this time but it was good to get out. Cheers for the messages and replies, I love this subreddit sometimes. If you happen to stumble upon this post in the future, feel free to PM me as this is probably gonna be a regular occurrence.



Edit: Also it's 4am, so I'm going to sleep/attempt to sleep :)



Edit: Waking up to all these comments was great. **Lots of people have suggested turning this into something** - i.e. choosing a time in GMT and doing this regularly, regardless of where you are. People have also suggested having a group chat or using Skype. **Please PM me your thoughts** because I'd love for this to happen and I'm crap at organising things :)



**Edit: Subscribe to /r/WalkWithMe!**

You’ve been asking yourself that question for a while now.



As the subway pulls in at St. Clair West, you contemplate when you’d have to step out in order to meet the oversized bullet speeding towards its next stop. How long it’d take you to hit the bottom of the tracks, if maybe you’d catch the third rail first and die by electrocution- painful. Not the way you want to go. Too much time in too many dark corners of the internet have taught you the numerous ways a human life can be extinguished.



The seats of the trains are questionable stained and likely just as old as you are. You take one without so much as a second thought and double-check your destination. The thoughts of third rails and TTC bullets vanish with the gust of wind that follows your out of the station.



Your doctor asks if you’re suicidal.



You remember your first real attempt, almost two years ago. You remember arguing with your mother about something- school, grades, whatever it is teenagers fight with their parents about. The recirculated air of the car chokes you, the weather uncharacteristically warm for May. A boat named 4PLAY passes you by. You don’t know why you remember it as well as you do, but it’s the most brilliant memory you have of that day.



She says something. You snap.



Seatbelt off. You wonder how far you’ll roll. The highway is busy- maybe you’ll hit a car. You know somewhere in the back of your mind you’ll probably survive, but it doesn’t bother you. What bothers you is what happens when you reach for the handle.



Locked.



In retrospect and in the doctor’s office, you’re thankful it was. You don’t know what would have happened after. If there would have even been an after.



Your doctor asks if you’re suicidal.



You recall a hunting trip with your dad. Guns are not strangers to you, but you’re conscious of their weight. The weight of the rifle in your hand is the weight of wicked lethality, of potential waiting to be unleashed. It reminds you of the full stop at the end of a sentence- immediate and total cessation. Were you to turn it on yourself here, two hours north of the middle of nowhere, nobody would ever find you.



Your dog pelts through the undergrowth to your side. Hardly a hunting dog, he prefers chasing butterflies to stalking prey.



When you were first put on medication, your mother brought him home in hopes of speeding along your recovery. He’s the sweetest, prettiest thing you’ve ever met. You didn’t understand innocence until he sat at your feet while you cried for hours, sometimes without cause. Sometimes the only way to get through the week is to remember that he’s waiting for you. He needs you. He can’t live without you.



You wouldn’t be alive without him.



Your doctor asks if you’re suicidal.



The answer clings stubbornly to the back of your teeth. This wouldn’t be the first time you’ve lied to him. Wouldn’t be the first time you’ve faced him after trying again. If three attempts have taught you anything, it’s that it’s surprisingly hard to kill yourself. The human body is remarkably resilient. And while thoughts of suicide come and go as frequently as hunger pangs, you still have troubling telling him yes. Three attempts and days spent hung up on close encounters that could have been seem like succinct proof, but you have trouble convincing yourself of your active desire to not live anymore.



Your doctor asks if you’re suicidal. 



You struggle to answer him, words forcefully pulled from the back of your throat. You’re not sure if you have the strength to kill yourself, you tell him. But if you were to be in the path of the runaway bus, you don’t think you’d have the strength to move, either.

Originally submitted to /r/sad, but after numerous PMs I was told to post it here as well.



I wrote this in my first year of university, arguably the deepest part of my depression. I thought I had rid myself of all of my angsty drabbles but apparently neglected this one, and only found it when clearing out my external hard drive. Maybe /r/sad isn't the best place for this, but I've been a long-time lurker and feel like a lot of people here could benefit from knowing they're not alone. I know I did.



For the curious: I'm doing better now. I'm still seeing my psychologist, my dog lives at home with me, and my boyfriend will be moving in with us next year. I'm so elated that my life is finally looking up after struggling for so long. 



**EDIT**: Wow! I can't believe the amount of feedback this has gotten. Thank you everybody for your support and sharing your stories. I've never had a piece of writing touch so many people before and I'm so glad to hear that year-old rambles can help so many people.

It would certainly be better than the alternative. Wouldn't it? I think I never recognized the depth of my internal problems until verbalizing the thought that "living is so hard. dying just seems so much easier."



I am surrounded by death, and I am also surrounded by people who have never in their lives experienced death. It's an odd situation. But one that I can summarize: I come from a 'destitute' background, and go to a prestigious university. 



Sounds like something right out of a cliched novel. But in the past few years I've lost my grandparents, my parents, and my dog. 



It's turned into a system. After each funeral, I come back to my picturesque college campus: a proverbial land of plenty, surrounded by wealthy peers who call me "deranged" and "problematic" and "abnormal". 



When I first got a full-ride to this school, I felt like Alice entering Wonderland. Now I feel like the Grim Reaper, suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, trapped in Zombieland. I don't understand the world I'm in on this campus, I don't understand the unrelenting personalities of my peers, and somehow, I can't imagine leaving. 



So as I cross the intersection to class every morning, I imagine what it would be like if that Escalade were to just run the red light.

So I have been seriously depressed for ten years. Every day has been a struggle. My career has sputtered to a halt, I've nearly ended my marriage, it has been awful. I've relentlessly beaten myself up for things that happened more than 15 years ago. I can't overstate the daily terribleness I have suffered through. No drugs or counseling have helped. 



A week ago I got into bed feeling awful as usual. I rolled onto my back and for some reason put both hands palm down in the centre of my chest, one below the other. 



Unbelievably, the mental pressure faded. The knot in my gut that has been my constant companion unwound. I was shocked. There was a warm, flow-y sensation that was hard to describe. I didn't move, just basked in it, fell asleep feeling like I was five again and mommy was reading me a book. 



I have been sleeping this way for a week now. Everything has changed. I am functioning again. My wife has noticed the difference. I never thought I would feel happy again, and now I can honestly say that I have, and am. I haven't changed anything but my sleep posture, but my motivation is back. Positive feedback loop here I come. 



So reddit, WTF is this? I have no idea why this worked for me, but I highly recommend you try it if you're depressed. Can't hurt right?

Over the last 6 months that I've been on here, I've seen some major highs and lows, but I think I'm ready to move on. You guys have been fantastic and you're one of the best communities on reddit. Thank you for all you have done for me and I hope I don't fall back into the place that brought me here.

Well here is the story, I am what it says, no life, not motivated, so alone for so long trying but never really connected. Lots of different careers but nothing ever captured me totally. My family has all passed, friends from youth and life have disappeared as happens in life. I am not weird or dumb life and moving around thinking I would find a new life doing other things just never found any real result. Oh sure there have been a few moments in time but they all went by the side of the road in search of something.

        So it sounds like I am pretty messed up but not abusive in any way really, only to deluding myself into thinking life will eventually happen for me. I have now gravitated to truck driving and being away as much as possible. If I am not home I am at least on the move and the illusion in my mind thinks this road travels somewhere for me. I have had different occupations but keep changing, to the point I am not motivated or have trouble finding interest in anything. Sadly I am not a negative person but just cannot get going, actually a well educated smart man who has a lot of interests and capable of many skills. I do good work with my hands and mind but feel there is no point to completing projects, who cares so why bother eventually it will get done.

      I am so tired of being in a crowd and being so alone looking at faces but really knowing nobody. I have wandered through so many places in the world and cannot believe and never found destiny in romance or career or just been happy. I was the baby in a small family and have memories of some good and some bad, but now am the sole survivor. Most of the passing were really terrible episodes in life and unexpected and left me to be the sole survivor.

      I am looking at going back on the long haul road and have a home in a great location that will see completion someday before I die. I work on it myself from construction just a do it myself project that keeps me going. Reality is that financially I will sell it at some point to support a simple life.

      I don't know I could ramble forever, I am so tired of searching for a partner in life, yes I love woman if that is fashionable to say anymore. I don't know this man has spent a life time alone and is feeling so down, that the thoughts of, who gives a shit, what does it matter, and who cares, have crept into my mind and at times a few darker thoughts that I am afraid to even mention. 

     I never thought life would be this way ,but it is, and I don't need to be told get out and get involved. I am not stupid but really  

don't know how to snap out and live life for some reason, everything sounds like a been there done that , I just want some reason to do it all because I have lost interest. I am not a perfect guy but I have seen far worse who see to be happy. 

     Any suggestions how to cure this lonely depression at the age of an old fool.

the only phone notifications you get are from game apps you haven't played in a while, or texts from your carrier about data usage and minutes. When I got that notification today, I couldn't help but just let out a laugh at just how absurd my life is right now. Guess you just gotta find the dark humor in these pathetic moments of realization.

How I explain depression to people who have never experienced it



Depression is like being in the deep end of a really big pool, and the deeper you go, the more depressed you are. When you feel sad, you're underwater, but you're near the surface, so reality is only slightly distorted and you can still see plenty of light. But the deeper you go, the less light there is, the darker it gets, the greater the pressure. Deep enough and there is no light left, only darkness, and the pressure is so great that it feels like it's going to crush you. You feel like you're suffocating, like you're going to die. The root cause of your depression is like a weight tied to you that pulls you down. Fix the root cause, cut the cord, and you start to float out of your depression. Anti-depressants are like floaties that help pull you back up to the surface.

It's so weird. I remember I always grew up very happy, I know, and remember very well, that if I was to rate my overall hapiness, I would always rate 10/10. 



But then I got depressed. And I couldn't remember what it was even like. I couldn't recall that anything but depression had ever been true. I couldn't even imagine that other people could be not on the verge of total breakdown, as I was - I just thought they were stronger, being able to be out in the world without crumbeling to pieces and hiding away crying their eyes raw ever 30 minuts. Because I saw how 'strong' other people was, to keep on living, even thriving, despite (I erronuisly thought) enduring the same pain as me, I also forced myself to keep going, even though I went through my day like a zombie, until I could excuse myself, and collapse on a restroom floor, screaming and crying.



An acquaintance killed himself in a down (bi-polar), and I saw this as confirmation that we all are on the verge of killing ourselves.



Then, as I wasn't even able to speak during my latest session with my psychologist due to hystric crying, I got medicine, and a referal to be hospitalized to keep me alive. I gave up the lease on my apartment, as I never thought I would be able to come back - "recovering" was a foreign word to me.



But then, something magical happened. Birds were singing. I woke with a smile on my face. I looked forward to breakfast. I was genuinely pleased to see my neighbor.



I. Was. Happy. Happy? Happy! I just couldn't believe it! Happy, me! At first I didn't even recognize the emoition, but then I welcomed it as an old friend. The contrast was so stark, I could really *feel* how distant happiness had been. I imagine this is what it's like for a blind person to see again. How can you explain the sunset, or the reflections of the ocean to someone who has no concept of it?



So, no hospitalization for me. Stayed with my parents until I was able to get a new lease. Everything is so crazy - I *want* to eat now, I *want* to get up in the morning, I *want* to meet people! Before, *everything* were cruel, heavy duties tearing me down.



The only thing that nags in the back of my head, is if I have a relapse. Now that I can see just how unhappy I was, I don't think I would survive a relapse, even just going halfway as low. I would never wish that on anyone, so if I had to endure it one more time, just one more day, I'd rather die.

To put it simply, I moved to Japan as an exchange student when I was 18 and been living here for two years. Despite all of my efforts, language barrier and cultural difference finally has taken its toll to my mental health and I've never been so depressed all my life. Not to mention that I've developed a binge eating disorder. 

I used to be a productive and positive person, but for this past two months I would just sit around, do nothing, bingeing on junk foods, feel guilty and throw it all up. And then I would cry myself to sleep every single night.  



Yesterday I decided that I have to do something if I want to change for the better. I called my close friends, and told them about my problems. At first I was hesitant about telling anyone because I feel embarrassed about my eating disorder and being homesick, but to my surprise they're being supportive and not judgmental. That alone had helped me through and gave me the motivation to clean my apartment that I've been neglected while I was being depressed. Now that my room is clean, I feel happier!



My room, before & after.

http://imgur.com/RwudqSX



I am hoping that the idea of clean environment = happier me will motivate me to tidy up a bit every day. 



Sorry if this is difficult to read, English is neither my first or second language.

And then you realise that anti depressants and therapy arent going to help you, and that you'll always feel this way and any happiness will just be a brief distraction from reality.

I don't know why I'm writing this, honestly it makes me feel pretty stupid. I've been depressed for years but I've never told anyone because I don't want to look weak. I put up a persona that makes me look tough, when in reality I'm fragile. I have so many thoughts and feelings but yet I only express my cynicism out loud. People perceive me as an asshole, but in a good way, ya know? I have friends, but I don't connect with them. I have trust issues ever since my childhood best friend came out as gay and tried to have his way with me.



My depression was at its worst when I was 15 so I stared smoking weed. It dulled my senses and I could finally sleep without laying awake for hours just thinking. Eventually I got caught and got locked up. Later on I moved out of my moms and abusive stepdads house and I'm living with my sister. Things have gotten much better over the past few years. I actually have days where I feel great, like nothing's wrong. Then other days I barley function and all I think about is suicide. 



Death would bring peace. I hate feeling like shit but I don't kill myself because I can't let my sister down. She's taken care of me so well, and I don't want it to go to waste. At the same time, though, I want to leave. I got accepted to college but I don't even want to go. I want to just drive across the country and start new, get my own apartment, own job and restart. But I can't because that'd kill me. I know if I did that I'd never be able to afford school, and I'd live a mediocre life. 



I hate that I despise people, yet I feel the need to be around them. To me, humans are the scum of the Earth. We're corrupt and nasty, disloyal and selfish. But yet we're beautiful. Fuck life.



I guess I'm just writing this to vent since I haven't ever really told anyone about how I feel, nor will I ever. I've been to a couple of therapists and talked about things but I can't open up, it's just not me. The only escape I have now is weed. For a couple hours at a time I feel nothing but bliss. I love everything when I'm high. I wish I could feel like that all the time but it's not possible. Fuck life.

I am more than a little frustrated because I am seeing a lack of support for those hurting here. I see some people making a genuine effort to comment and let people know that they care. However, I also see people's posts being ignored, overlooked, and even downvoted! Why would you downvote someone who is sharing something intimate with you, knowing their struggles!? It is cruel and it is better to do nothing at all! 



I came here and spent two hours the other day writing something that came from the most intimate part of my life and was greeted with one response that was later deleted and 0 upvotes. I know things can be missed. I know I wrote a lot. Honestly I am more concerned for people who have no one to talk to. This sub has 100,000+ subs. It is not hard to click a little arrow to show someone that you read their story and relate to them. We should be able to do better than this!



Edit: To those saying "I am too depressed to respond." I am sorry I did not include you in the post. I have been there and that is a really bad feeling. You are not alone.

I have 3 dollars left in my bank account and rent is due soon. No presents for anyone. It's hard to watch your sister be showered in gifts while you're struggling. I want to cry so bad but I can't. My room mate is trying to drag me out with her since she sees I'm in a funky mood, but I declined. I'm not trying to add seeing my ex to my list of a why this is a wonderful shitmas. I hate being poor. I hate being forced to live on my own at 20 years old. I just literally hate my life and as much as I wholeheartedly try to better it, some greater force shits on my attempts and laughs at me while I try to clean the shit up. I hate Christmas. I hate everything.

A lot of us are alone. I don't know what kind of streaming service can show movies with a chat bar on the side but we should get one and have a movie night together.



EDIT: I'm really glad you guys like the idea! I've dug around a little but have exactly 0 experience in streaming... if somebody has a little more know-how to do it make a post and/or pm me! This could be cool!



DOUBLEEDIT: So I messaged the mods and they said that stickies are for subreddit business only, and recommended we make our own sub. Anybody have know-how in making subs who wants to jump in?



TRIPLEEDIT: /u/pixelnote has created /r/depressionmovies, which is where we're going to be doing this! Head on over and help us get all set up with ideas and tips; I think this is going to turn out really neat!

Wow everyone it's great this is getting so much attention and everyone's personal experiences of this type of treatment are very interesting. I think it's critically important that people learn depression is not a state of mind or a matter of just feeling a bit down. The word depression gets banded around and miss used too much. If Only we could snap out of it.

I feel a lot of stressed  when i'm at my school. I don't really have friends at my school i only hangout with 2 peoples that i consider like my friends but i don't think they feel the same way for me so i'm actually alone all by myself i'm naturally shy and introvert and i try my best to makes friends and talk to people but it seems that nobody's is interesting by talking to me because of that i feel like crap like i'm nothing... i also got a lot of critics and mocks because of my weight.I always hide my feelings in front of people to looks strong and  like i feel nothing but inside it kills me and everynight i cry so bad.It's even worse because nobody's support me even my family don't support me i've got 1 brother and he is the favorite child he always get what he wants he even treat me like a complete  piece of shit and my parents is always on his side he always got an excuse and i've got none.Anyways i just want to talk to someone i feel very lonely like it's me against the world nobody's have ever support me or liked me really...it seems that all my life people been using me because of my kindness and put me down i'm always there for people support them being attentive to them try to help etc... but no one give that back to me :(

So... I feel... extremely defeated right now. Not in the way you might think. Backstory time.



A while back, I was feeling very, very alone, and I very much lost the will to live, and I was contemplating suicide, as I'm sure many of us here have done. At that point, I met a person online who brought a tiny light into my life. Things were actually going well. He stuck around for a year or so, and during that time, another close friend came into the picture(if either of you is reading this, I want you to know I have no hard feelings), and I just felt like I'm not going downhill for once.



However, all things must come to an end, and so did those friendships. I don't even want to start going into detail about what was whose fault - everyone blamed themselves, and perhaps deep down everyone blamed everyone else as well. We'll never know. The point is, that left me... devastated. If I had a reliable suicide method, I really would have done it that time. I was completely, one hundred percent convinced that this world is bad.



I was screaming inside: "THIS WORLD IS FUCKED! PEOPLE ARE FUCKED! WE'RE ALL FUCKED UP AND SHIT!" 



I lived my life day by day, repeating that to myself, almost religiously - it was the truth, after all! I came so very near to death a couple times... And then, I decided that I would -prove- that nobody cares and everyone is shit. It's the truth, therefore it has to be easy to prove, right? 



I called out for help, here. I knew for a fact that nobody would really help me. I was victorious. And at the apex of my cynical glory... she came along. A stranger, replying in a way that made it clear that she understands what I am going through - but she will turn out to be just another uncaring person, I said to myself. A couple messages later, she offered to stay in contact with me. At that point I was completely sure I was right all along - I was sure that if I did not initiate conversations, she would not do so either. 



I was so. fucking. wrong. And it feels so. fucking. AMAZING.

She asks me how I'm doing out of the blue, she legitimately cares if I'm not doing well, she offers help and solutions, and she feels the pain I go through. Despite my ridiculous defeatist attitude, she has managed to prove my negative assumptions wrong over and over and over and over. She's actually such a great person that even at my most fucked up, I know she cares about me and will be there for me. 



To this person: Thank you so. much. Words can hardly explain how much what you did and are doing means to me. You salvaged me at my absolute worst.



To everyone else reading this: Do not, for a moment, believe that nobody cares. Ever. That is not true. No matter how long you tell yourself that nobody cares, -someone- does. As cliché as this sounds, you may have just not met them yet, but you will. Just hang in there. Help -is- coming. I don't know how far away that help is, what it looks like, who it is - but it is coming.



Stay safe boys and girls



Edit: Oh my gosh these upvotes and replies. My post exploded, whaaaat? Thank you so much everyone!

"Depression is seductive: it offends and teases, frightens you and draws you in, tempting you with its promise of sweet oblivion, then overwhelming you with a nearly sexual power, squirming past your defenses, dissolving your will, invading the tired spirit so utterly that it becomes difficult to recall that you ever lived without it...or to imagine that you might live that way again. With all the guile of Satan himself, depression persuades you that its invasion was all your own idea, that you wanted it all along. It fogs the part of the brain that reasons, that knows right and wrong. It captures you with its warm, guilty, hateful pleasures, and, worst of all, it becomes familiar. All at once, you find yourself in thrall to the very thing that most terrifies you. Your work slides, your friendships slide, your marriage slides, but you scarcely notice: to be depressed is to be half in love with disaster. " ~ Stephen L. Carter

Reading the posts here and lurking has been great for me and really helped me understand that my feelings were common when I felt most alone. Over the past few months I've been busting my ass getting my life together and have been feeling positive, and reading the posts here (or even the titles), have given me pangs of the type of feelings I'm trying to avoid. You're all wonderful, beautiful people, and we're all going to make it :)

I just moved into college a few days ago. I've made a few friends, but I keep making plans to go out. 



These plans cause me huge anxiety and stress. Going out spontaneously is fine, but planning stuff makes me extremely stressed out, and I've already cancelled on somebody despite only having been here for five days.



Do you have any advice?

So I've been in therapy for about 6 months about my depression and social anxiety. I've learned a lot through my sessions and it's helped me achieve a better outlook on life. I also can give presentations now! So here are some things that Doc has told me.



Sorry for formatting/typos I'm on mobile.



1) people with depression tend to have a negative bias. They can only see and feel all the negative things and it becomes a physical weight on them. What they don't realize is it's a lot of small negative things that are all stacked into a pile on their back. Positive things will feel non existent. However, positive things are small too. Just try to make them bigger than the negatives. If you go get your favorite food, savor it and remember the flavor. Think about how the food makes you feel. Try to enhance that feeling. You can tackle 1 negative problem at a time and when you do complete it then do the same thing. Remember how it feels to get that thing done. Enhance it and hold onto that feeling.



2) focus on the present moment. Let the future come and don't try to fight it. As Eisenhower once said, "planning is necessary, but plans are not."



3) those feelings of anxiety and or embarrassing moments happen. Meditating helps to get through them. Count your breaths and clear your mind. When a memory comes by just watch it pass. Then when another comes by do the same thing. Count your breaths to say 10 then start over. It helps you fall asleep as well.





Well that's all I have time for. I have some more advice my therapist gave me. If people want I can post those when I can. Thank you for reading this wall of text! I hope it helps you! Pm if anyone wants to chat with me. :)



Edit 1: some typos fixed. And it looks like I'll write some more when I have time. And yes these things take effort. It feels like a ton of effort but eventually it'll become second nature.



Edit 2: whoa this really blew up. Now I understand the that some advice is weird or seems directly untrue. But this is what helped me with my depression. Its advice from a licensed therapist who has multiple doctorates in human behavior. I like the advice and thought I'd share to try to help those who where or are like me.

It's one thing to be a troubled adolescent (which I was), then those tricky 20s... now I'm in my 40s watching people my age (or even decades younger) achieving such incredible things and making real lives for themselves - it is gut wrenching.  I feel two inches tall.  I'm envious, but feel helpless to do much more than stay sober, physically healthy, mentally stable, and have a simple life.   Once things get complicated I lose my shit, can't cope, get depressed, etc.  So I just sort of stay comfortable but stuck.

As the title says I am completely alone. Loneliness is killing me. As introverted as I am, I just can't deal with the fact that NOBODY wants anything to do with me. When I say I have no friends I mean that 100%. I don't have a single friend, not even an acquaintance. I'm so alone that most days I don't even use my voice (unless you count crying). I'm going to be one of those people who lies dead in their apartment for months before anyone discovers the body. (I'm not suicidal, even though I should be)



I'm in my mid 20s & graduated from college quite a while ago. Even in school when it's supposedly easy to make friends, I was alone most of the time. I had a few "friends" come and go, but they were just narcissists who kept me around because they wanted somebody to listen to them talk endlessly. If I tried to say anything about myself they ignored me or just shut me down. I was just a receptacle for their self-absorbed rants.



I hate myself so, SO much. My depression has lasted for over 6 years with no end in sight. I'm pretty sure it originated from the constant rejection and bullying I experienced in school. Tried therapy multiple times. They just took my money and offered nothing. So I tried self help. All self help resources suggest "reaching out to a support system"... "a strong network of friends and family is key to your success". Well, fuck. I don't have a support system! 



People always say "you are not alone"... But I AM. Why was I cursed with horrible social skills, anxiety issues and a boring personality? I'm a good person; I may be shy but I always treat people with kindness if they give me the chance. If I had a real friend I'd be so loyal, I'd love the hell out of them. But instead I just repel people. Go ahead and tell me I'm whiny, downvote me, whatever I don't care. There is nothing anyone can do to me that can match the pain of living a life in constant, unyielding isolation. I'm so tired of being invisible. Is anyone else just 100% completely alone?



*EDIT: Woah, I wasn't expecting more than a few replies. Thank you all so much. ;_;

I have never seriously entertained the idea of killing myself, but sometimes when I think about the future, I get this overwhelming sense of dread and just wish I could disappear. Does anyone else very feel this way?





Edit: Wow, I am astounded by the amount of people that share this feeling. Im not sure about everyone else, but I find it kind of reassuring to know that I am not alone. I will try to reply to as many comments as I can, but if anyone just wants someone to talk with, feel free to message me! I wish you all the best of luck

Day after day I sit here in my room and do nothing, but I always feel like there just isn't enough time. For example; I want to play a video game or watch a movie but that takes time so I don't do it. I want to do my homework, but that takes a lot of time and effort and no one is making me do it, so I don't.



The only place where I do usuful things are at school, being distracted by tasks I have to do is the only way I can be productive. Even better when I get to leave early if I am fast enough.



I just don't understand it, why do I feel like this when I should have all the time in the world?

I've literally never ever heard anybody say that in my life. I've been with some pretty shitty people, but everyone has always been supportive when I'm not in a good place. Him saying that lead to huge argument and I had to leave. I mean, getting better is a choice. But is not as easy for everybody. Who the hell would choose to be depressed and having Anxiety and any kind of mental disorder? That alone makes me just want to leave him. I can't stay with somebody who thinks that way about mental disorderS. Am I in the wrong? Am I overreacting?

I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a couple years ago, and I've been aware of these symptoms (and their worsening) since I was around 14.



Well, I've had a relatively shitty life, and one of the things I always did to cope was to imagine myself in different universes.  They are generally of whatever book series or media/video game/anime I am interested in at the time.



Except, now I'm 19 and with all the imagining I can do, I can't imagine anything good for my own life.  In fact, it would be accurate to say that I am largely disassociated with my own life.  I spend much of my time imagining myself to be anywhere but here.  Even when I did have a job (long story short I quit due to panic attack and now I have an appointment set with vocational rehabilitation next week), I spent much of my time just daydreaming.  It's-- not healthy.  It's gotten to the point where it's just sad.  I could never kill myself but I wouldn't mind if I didn't exist anymore.  I'm too depressed to have a creative outlet for my overactive imagination, as I've lost interest in all aspects of my life.  I've lost touch with a lot of my friends.  I'm left with a deep longing for happiness and a different life and mind.  



Most people look forward to things like securing a good job, marrying somebody they love, and having kids.  I am asexual and don't see a future for myself when it comes to family.  I hardly feel human at this point.  I know I did at some point but that point is not now, and I just have gotten used to this in a sick way.  My therapist and rational part of my mind says I need to be on medication, but I grew up around a family who did nothing but medicate and abuse drugs to solve problems and I see it as a personal failure if I give in.  



Oddly, I don't judge other people for needing medication, but when it comes to me I feel like the weakest and most pathetic piece of shit in the whole world.

I got up and out of bed. I didn't have the energy to shower but I brushed my hair. I put on real clothes and I got up. I spent time outside in the sunshine with my mom and sister. I'm so proud of myself for finally gletting the strength to get out of bed for a few hours. It's more than I've done in a week. I did it! 



Tomorrow my goal is to get up before lunchtime, shower, and brush my teeth. It may not seem like a lot but I'm trying to be patient with myself.



Update - I made a new post https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/37i5ie/update_im_the_one_that_finally_got_out_of_bed/ 



Things are worse tonight. The night is always my worst time. I really wish I had more people to talk to and get support. I just want to be pain free.

My (21F) boyfriend of 6 months (25m) had no idea I was depressed. I have tried really hard to hold it together, but the last week or so I just hit breaking point. I'm at the point where I'm taking oxycodone every day the last few days to numb the pain. I **know** suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. I **know** it's the wrong choice and I need help. But I can't control my emotions, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest and I'm ready to do just about anything to get them off. 



I have three major concerns about suicide - I am terrified of hurting people around me. I am terrified of fucking it up and inflicting permanent disability on myself rather than successfully killing myself. And I'm terrified of the idea that I'll lay dead in my apartment for days or even weeks before anyone notices. I live alone, my family lives in another city. I have friends but it would probably take at least a week for them to put the pieces together and come and check on me. 



I recognised the need to tell someone and get help, and I opted to tell my boyfriend. We have been arguing for a few weeks but it still completely shook me that his response was to break up with me. I now feel really helpless. I tried to do the right thing and I mustered up the courage to tell someone, and it backfired. I am even more depressed and devastated that I am the 'crazy broken girl'. Now I have thoughts like "no wonder he doesn't want me anymore". I fucked everything up with him because I couldn't cover my depression up any longer. I'm convinced I'll always be this way - I can't cope with things that have happened years and years ago. 



I feel like he's treating me with tough love but that's not what I need. All I want right now is for him to hold me and tell me it will get better and he'll be there. Not "you're being silly, you don't want that, things can never be that bad". He obviously has no understanding of what I'm going through. I **know** things aren't that bad. I **know** there's billions of people worse off than I am. But that's what hurts even more - my logical brain knows these things, but my emotions are completely out of whack and I feel a different way. 



I'm lost. I'm hurt. I tried to ask for help and he walked away.

Flossing is one of those menial tasks that manages to elude the vast majority of people. Whether it's mere forgetfulness or pure apathy towards dental hygiene -- it's pretty obvious that most people neglect this very basic routine.



What does this have to do with clinical depression, you might ask? Well, one of the perpetual characteristic negative thought cycles in our depressed brain is that of inadequacy. We never think we are 'enough' -- be it in our school work, career, social life, or what have you. We like to think that we are 'subpar', 'below average', etc.



By engaging in the simple act of flossing, I am better than the overwhelming majority of people out there. I am doing something that puts me in a small percentage of the population that takes its dental hygiene seriously. It's even something that I can brag about the next time I visit a dentist: "Yea, I floss; and I'm DAMN PROUD of it."



It does seem rather silly to be so proud of such a small thing. Yet, big successes are built on small ones. Maybe next time I see that cute girl at Starbucks I'll smile and show off my awesome pearly whites! Maybe my dental epiphany will inspire you to find that one little thing you absolutely ROCK at!

Hey all. I'm 18 and it's currently about 2:30 AM and today (or yesterday i guess) was one of the best days of my life. I finally had my first kiss and it was just so magical. I never thought anybody would want to kiss me or be interested in me, but she was, and she truly is one of the few things that makes me happy. Amidst all the hardships and sadness in my life she is always by my side and cares about me so much. I'm glad it was her that got my first kiss. For now, even if only for a little while, I am finally truly happy.  

  

So yeah, just thought I'd share with all you wonderful people a new, special piece of my life.

I used to be an avid reader. I read between classes, during classes, during lunch, during dinner, until my eyes were shutting on their own at night. I loved being able to escape into a world of imagination and feeling like I had gained new friends. 



To this day, I still love books, but I can't read them. I have shelves upon shelves of books--unbroken spines and the weight of an adventure at my fingertips. I continue to buy them because I love the idea of being able to finally sit down and enjoy them. 



But I can't. I can get three pages in and my mind just wanders and the focus is gone. Reading is now a chore. It drives me nuts, because I want so badly to be able to sit and enjoy it. 



Eventually, I'll reach that point again. It's a very slow process, but my bookshelf needs the attention. I hope that I'll be able to embrace it.

I don't really want to kill myself but I don't want to live either. I'm not happy, I'm not sad, I just am. I feel this quiet nothingness every waking second. I hardly eat anymore and I feel heavy. Are the antidepressants working?



I don't understand. I don't really care about my family. I have no friends. Man I'd love a good friend. I'd love someone to love me. I just want to vanish but I don't want to die and I've never felt anything like this before. Anyone get what I mean?

There was a previous thread like this and it seemed to make people happy. So i thought why not start another one! 



Maybe you could add a little story to say why you visit this subreddit as well, which would be nice.

Yup, you read right. I frequent hookers a lot, and yesterday I got so lonely I couldn't get an erection.  I just told her straight up that I just want to talk. Surprisingly, she was happy and thanked me for not having sex. I had some time left and we talked. I mean she was a drug addict, but I asked what her situation was, and we got to talking. It was great, we talked for about about a half hour and she was so friendly, I even got her phone number. It was nice to actually make a friend.



It was embarrassing that I couldn't get hard, but I don't regret it because it was nice to get to know someone in the flesh. Yea, online friends are great, but it's just text in the end.



I'm such a joke, I'm 28 and never had a girlfriend.

Just a background, I've dealt with d derision for many years in my life. I though I had conquered five years ago in college, but I was wrong. It cost me my job and strained my relationship with my family and girlfriend.



Since then though, I've been to a doctor and have been responding very well to medication, things with ask of my friends and family have improved, and I found myself in a new, better paying and more rewarding job.



Life was great three days ago. Knowing he's gone just makes me feel empty. He was one of us. I'm sure a lot of us would rather be him than us. He was more than a funny guy or a comedian. He was someone I looked up to, someone I admired and wanted to be more like. I loved that man as much as someone who had never met him could.  



I just feel empty. I haven't felt like you'd since before I started treatment. I know I'm strong enough to get past this, but I just feel bad whenever I fall backward n



If anyone is reading this, and we all know there are lurkers, I did plenty of that a few months ago when I was at my lowest, get help. I can't tell you how much better it made my life. Medication may not be the treatment for you, but for me it literally saved my life. I can't wait to get to work tomorrow morning and be productive.

i called my university's crisis hotline (at the behest of my mother) after having a bit of a breakdown about the fact that i can't find a job and i'm out of money



the counselor on the phone told me, between now and when i meet with my therapist, to *try not to think about it*



after i hung up, i started laughing, it was the single funniest thing ever



i know they mean well, but try not to think about suicidal thoughts?  

as if it's that simple?



fucking hilarious



edit: my mom is willing to pay for food, since a lot of people seemed concerned about that, so i'm fine on that more immediate front

Hey, the last few days have been rough, but with some help from my only true friend, yesterday I made it a week without physically harming myself. Yeah, I've though of killing myself or cutting for the pain, but I decided not to. I know it's not much but to me it's a big accomplishment.

I have this friend I often text when I'm feeling down, but lately I haven't been able to bring myself to do it. I feel like I'm bothering him by repeating the same stuff over and over, and as he also is my school-buddy I don't want to ruin our relationship by always whining. It's just that.. I don't know, somehow it helps to just tell a friend that I'm sad, so that I won't be all alone with it. DAE feel this way?

I'm sure someone has already posted something like this, but I came across this subreddit and decided posting could be a good distraction that actually helps me in some way. 



I know this method just makes things worse, but right now it's about choosing the lesser of two evils. I either try to go to sleep normally and spend the night spiraling into despair and self loathing or I fuck up my sleep by staring at a computer screen all night. The only way I can fall asleep anymore is by forcing myself to stay awake until my body knocks me out. I just wish I could lie down in bed, count sheep or some shit and drift to sleep like a normal person, but nope. It's like my brain's default setting is self destruction. As soon as I'm not distracted BOOM time to go over all the reasons why you hate yourself. 



I'm so tired.



Edit: uh, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/57envd/theres_an_aggressively_destructive_voice_in_my/) a follow-up to this post I guess

I don't really *want* anything, so I just try to fake it. I pretend I'm into whatever it is my friends are interested in. I pretend I like going to see movies with them. I just spent 3 days at a gaming convention where I pretended to enjoy myself.



I feel like the only thing I genuinely want, is food and sleep. I wish I wanted things. Even simple, stupid shit. I have a friend who is passionate about Lego and can't wait to buy his next Lego set. I'd love to be that passionate about something. I don't care how trivial it is at this point. I just want to look forward to something or enjoy a hobby. 



Everybody else seems to know so much about their favourite topic and they never seem to get tired of it. I just don't understand.

Hello all, it's not easy for me to be posting here as I am not the type of person that typically shares my thoughts, feelings, or emotions with anyone.



I'm not someone who has dealt with depression until very recently and it has hit me hard and fast. I didn't even know emotions could make you feel this physically ill. So I guess I've come here to see some sort of open discussion of the situation or get some sort of insight on someone who's been through something similar, as I can't rearrange my thinking of this to forgive myself. 



A couple of months ago my best friend since grade school who had been battling with depression for years committed suicide. After years of failed support and many attempts from his friends and family to uplift his spirits he finally did it after days of vague facebook posts. 



The night that he did it he texted me twice, telling me he's just looking for someone to be around because he's bored. I had family over, it was late, and it was a holiday so I didn't bother texting him back. The next morning I realized I would regret not texting him back for the rest of my life because that was my last chance to ever talk to him. 



Ever since that morning when I realized what happened its like my attitude towards life took a 180. I've started hating myself for it, I have dreams where all of our friends find out he texted me and everyone starts blaming me, mental images of those last two texts show up in my head all day, I constantly replay our final conversations in my head desperately wondering if he left this world hating me because of something I said or didn't say, and now I've developed intense insomnia because of all the "what if" questions that race through my head every night. 



It's only getting worse. I've been an A-B college student for 2 years or so now, and last semester I didn't make it through the first month before my grades were so busted I had to drop. Then I couldn't bear to get out of bed in the morning so I stopped going to work all together without even saying anything to anybody. I've lost any and all motivation to do any of my hobbies like drawing or music and have abandoned all of my projects. I never answer my phone when friends or family call and now I sit in my home 24 hours a day, some days sleeping until 9pm because I feel I have so little to do. I've become utterly useless. What is going on with me? This is so unnatural. How do I get out of this hole?

I can't really understand the logic behind how people react to severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts.  Why is it even considered acceptable to reject and invalidate how a person is feeling when it comes to such thoughts? And yet people who do this to others who are depressed still sit around scratching their heads when someone finally takes their own life.



Honestly, 99.9% of the time when I even dare to bring up feeling depressed/insecure/hopeless people cut me out of their lives.  That or they pummel me with a barrage of bullshit about positive thinking and how I should just "suck it up".  Then when I don't respond to it, they cut me out of their life.



I'm guessing it's just easier to reject someone than it is to comprehend there might be valid reasons why they lack the will to keep living?

Fellow redditors in /r/depression I know this is a hard time to feel this way. I understand your pain and I understand your desire to be left alone until everything ends. I understand that all of your environment is joyful and happy and you don't feel like it. I am like you.



Even though I'm not having the best time of my life I know that this is just a temporary thing and that someday this will pass and that I will be able to look back and realize that I'm in a better place.



Meanwhile I just want to send you an internet hug and wish you a normal day if that is what you wish today.

They caught me cutting myself yesterday. I finally told them about my depression and suicidal tendencies. I feel like I've destroyed their world.



I can't live now. I can't go on. I love them too much to put them through the misery of my own suffering. I need to kill myself as soon as fucking possible.

Doesn't need much more explanation than the title.  Rejection is a pretty big trigger for me.  Not looking forward to the next few days.



Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words.  I need to get out of my own head and stop taking everything so personally.  This community has helped a lot when I'm at low points.   Thanks

Hi, /r/depression! I've decided over a long period of believing that nobody cares or listens about what I think or feel, that I'll try the Internet. Maybe it'll work, I don't know. Maybe it will just be like every other experience I've had. Anything's better than talking to an imaginary friend in bed at night while crying (yes, I'm that desperate).



This post might get long and tangent-y but hang in there. I'm Ethan. I'm 12. I have no real friends, ADHD, mood disorder and ASD (seriously, that shit isn't self diagnosed). My parents have fought with each other ever since I can remember, and they got divorced last year. I've been bullied since preschool, and at this point I don't think any person in the school gives a shit because nobody will listen. I *was* obsessed with technology and coding, until my parents took that away because they thought I was addicted and it was making me sad (I'm writing this while sneaking a computer, because I'm desperate for somebody to talk to). Really, the fact was, everything else *but* technology made me sad. That was the problem. Not technology, but the stuff that happened around it. More recently, my mom and I have been getting in huge fights that have ended in violence from both sides, and she never recognizes that she does anything wrong. It's always my fault, all of the time. She tells me "you ruin everything" like at least 10 times a week. She brings my sister who beats me up when nobody watches that they never punish to karaoke without me because I'll "ruin it." Then she calls me at my dad's house and says that she wants to have a good relationship with me but *I* need to change. Its like she doesn't even realize that she hurts me. When I ask her if she realizes she hurts me, she says "yes", but when I ask her what she does to hurt me, she says "zilch". School is even worse, because its full of kids who tell me I'm weird, mean, and retarded, followed by laughing with their friends. Kids say that bullying is horrible, but sometimes they don't even realize **that *they* are being the bully.** They get sad when something like [Amanda Todd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Amanda_Todd) happens, but they only give a shit until she dies. They don't give a shit about the (at least) thousands of other depressed teenagers who are depressed. ***BUT!*** THEY TOTALLY CARE ABOUT AMANDA TODD OH NO IT WAS HORRIBLE!



Anyway, I probably seem like any other emo teenager who complains about how "horrible" their life is, but I never said my life is horrible. There is a big difference between "hard" and "horrible." I have no plans of suicide, because I don't want to let a shitty childhood ruin the rest of my life.





**edit:** I'm not sure why people downvoted this. I guess I'm right. Not even the /r/depression gives a shit. I am worthless. Fuck, there goes talking to the Internet. One less person to talk to.



**edit 2:** MORE DOWNVOTES? Seriously, it just gets worse and worse for me here.



**edit FUCKING AMAZING CRAZY COOL NUMBER YO:** I'm SO glad to see all of the comments, I'm just reading them now, thank you all so much! I'll reply to as many as I can in a few hours. I'll be up all night!

I have good friends.  I have a great family.  Not a single one of them has noticed I am suffering from depression.  I don't know if I've just become particularly adept at hiding it, but I feel that I show classic symptoms of it (sleep a lot, keep to myself, etc.) and at this point all it would take is for someone to say "hey... I noticed you're sad all the time.  Is there anything I can do to help?"   Not that they could really "help", but that acknowledgement alone would mean so much to me.  



The not noticing just makes me seem so invisible.

Hi, r/depression. Throwaway account and first time posting, but I follow and comment fairly often on this board, and have seen a really helpful, supportive community, so I just want to know if anyone else can relate to this feeling. 



A little bit of background on me: 24/f, diagnosed with MDD for the first time at 14 and have (apparently) struggled with GAD and depression on and off since then. At 21, I developed an eating disorder that ultimately led to me being partially hospitalized for a few months at an eating disorder treatment center. Since then, I've been on every medication under the sun and in frequent individual therapy with a counselor that I have grown to trust. Despite all of this, I have at least convinced myself that I have felt no relief from the depression symptoms and I'm starting electroconvulsive therapy on Wednesday.



Starting the ECT has given me crippling anxiety, and I'm struggling with a lot of self-doubt about my symptoms. I have always had a quiet voice in my head that's told me I'm not actually depressed, just lazy and selfish and manipulative. With this treatment looming, I'm terrified that if it doesn't work, it will confirm these fears and I'll have to face the fact that I'm not ill, just a bad person. 



I feel like I faked my eating disorder and could have eaten if I wanted to. Having an eating disorder and being sent to treatment got me medical leave from law school, and at the time I felt like my life was so out of control that I just needed a break. My eating disorder did that for me. I'm in school again now, and I often find that I feel lazy and unmotivated. I feel selfish and self-absorbed. I don't do things for other people. I think I manipulate others and not even my own family really likes the person I am. I've been having frequent panic attacks about these realizations over the past few days, because I feel like if the ECT doesn't work, then this is just the person I am, and I know I don't want to live my life as this person. I want to change, but I just feel so exhausted and hopeless and don't know where to start. 



Sorry if that seems jumbled. I'm having a hard time concentrating and keeping my emotions under control. 



Thank you so much in advance to anyone who reads this and responds.

kind of a rant...



i have suffered from anxiety and depression pretty much my whole life. i ahve been on and off meds since i was 13. it is not something i am open about but if you know me well enough you can tell when i am having an episode. 



i have been having a rough month and accidentally snapped at a new girl at work. one of my friends talked to her and basically told her it wasn't her fault, i was just having a rough month. well this new girl decided she needed to come comfort me. remind you she does not know me, or anything about me. she comes up saying "oh i know where you're coming from. i have anxiety issues **giggle** to. my boyfriend thinks it is adorable."



WTF? none of this is adorable. and if you do actually have these issues and he thinks they are adorable, he is NOT healthy for you. 



i am just so sick of tumblr and other social media outlets portraying depression/anxiety as "hip" or "in". they are not cute or fun. they are awful, sometimes deadly diseases. 



sorry for the rant.

I just wanted to say that you guys are an amazing group of people. I've seen lives saved by you folks and even if you do nothing else in your life, I want each and every one of you to know that you have done your purpose in life. It's amazing to see so many people take time out of their day to help others who suffer from something so horrible. If I could, I would give every single one of you gold. But seeing as how I can't afford that, I do give all of you my blessing. Save this post, because when there's no one else to talk to, I'm here for each and every one of you.

I don't like that I'm depressed, antisocial and lonely. People at work ask me to hang out with them, but they usually go to a bar, and as an alcoholic I don't want to be there. Even if it's something like board games, I feel tired all the time and I don't have energy to talk to anyone. Every day I just wait until I can go home and spend the evening lying on my bed with the laptop. It's a downward spiral.

I hate halloween. Everyone is having fun today. Well, NOT ME. I don't even know what "fun" is anymore. I can't turn on my radio or even tv, because all I hear/see is people getting ready to have a good time tonight. I'm not logging into facebook/instagram, because, all I see is PEOPLE HAVING FUN!



I just want this weekend to pass-by ASAP, just so I could dive into my work again.







*Sorry, I just wanted to vent. I hope I didn't bother you too much.*





EDIT: Thank you guys for the replies. It really makes me feel more comfortable, knowing that I'm not the only one.

It hurts for indescribable reasons. I don't remember the last time someone touched me with any sort of care or intent. It makes me feel vulnerable in a bad way. Most days, I sit with a blanket wrapped tightly around my shoulders to try to avoid the feeling. It never really works anymore. A type of unease crawls underneath my skin everyday, always reminding me of what I don't have.



I fantasize an unhealthy amount. If I focus hard enough I can almost feel someones hand rubbing between my shoulder-blades, or running through my hair. Its as close as I can get. I try to convince myself that it could be worse since I don't actually know what the real thing feels like. I don't really know how true that is.



Its touch-starvation, if such a thing really exists. Everyone lists food, water, oxygen, and shelter as the basic human necessities. I think we should add touch to the list. Not having it has left me feeling so fundamentally unbalanced, distressed, and distraught I can't help but wonder what will happen to me if it continues. Its become something I feel like I *need*.



Fuck me. I've had to fight for myself for as long as I can remember, can *something* be easy for once? I just really need a break. I'm not sure how much longer my willpower can hold me up.

I was driving home from work thinking about stuff and I started getting all blah feeling. And it an hour long drive so i definitely had time to think and brood and whatever.

Anyway something clicked in my head and I said to myself Lannaaax3, cheer the fuck up and do something nice for yourself. So i stopped and scheduled an appointment for my first tattoo and i got my hair done all special and it made me feel really good. 

Now my hair is half pink and im scheduled for a pretty awesome tattoo and for a little while i felt good.

Gives me some hope :)

like a constant existential crisis. everything i do is to avoid the pain. sure it helps. sure seeing a guy helps, new job, achievments, friends help but only for the moment until its back to thinking about ways of killing yourself with the least retribution.

im struggling constantly. its no way to live.

My friend's been missing for about 2 months. We met here, so I already have a bit of a hunch she might be going through a rough patch. I'm worried.



I only really know her as Bicycle. So with all the power of the internet, I have no way to check up on her. If you see this, please at least let me know you're alright. I understand if you're isolating, and I can handle being alone. But this worry is starting to get to me.



I'm posting this obviously in hopes that you'll find it, and to vent. I've began browsing this sub for about 4 hours a day, looking for anything that might resemble something you'd say. It's draining, and I give up. I miss you.

I just needed to vent about my depression and my issues with society's stance on it somewhere.



I thought these were supposed to be the best years of my life? I'm not ugly, and I like to think I'm funny and friendly, so why don't people like me? I'm always alone. Always, always, always. I've spent my whole life in transition, and though I've made "friends," I don't have anyone I can rely on.



I know it's stupid, but I want to be wanted. I want people to like me, to want me around, and to give a shit if I fall off the face of the earth. But they don't.



I have no money, so I can't do the only thing I really want to do: get away. I'd love to just hop on a train or a plane and just get the fuck away from here, but I wouldn't know where to begin. I don't even have enough gas to get out of the state.



My family loves me. I have a boyfriend who, though I can't see him often, loves me. What's wrong with me? I take 225mg of venlafaxine every day, why aren't I happy? Life leaves me with such a sour taste in my mouth. I feel like I'm out of things to look forward to. I'm two years into my college career, transferring schools for the fall semester, and changing my major to something I hardly care about.



I hardly care about anything. I don't want a job.  I don't want to work. I don't want to do anything, but I'm sick of doing nothing.



All I used to have was my writing, and I'd almost be thankful my depression is back so I can write again, but I'm too unmotivated to even crank out a poem. 



I'm sick of people liking everyone better than me. I'm sick of myself. I'm sick of not getting invited out. I'm sick of coming up with reasons not to eat or cut myself.  I can't let my family down by dying, but I'm letting myself down by staying alive.



I don't get what's so terrible about being alone. Society has made it so taboo to suffer. Where are all the other depressed kids? I'm sick of having the party scene shoved in my face. I don't have friends who want to hug me, I don't have people who want me at their parties. I just want some other depressed kids with no fucking friends to come over and sit with me and not feel the pressure to fill the silence.



I'm sick of the social "trend" of not having friends. Don't post a status saying "omg have no friends" or "lol so depressed such a loner" if you're on your way to a friend's house. I don't want your ironic hipster sadness shoved in my face when I'm barely staying alive every day.



Fuck, man.



I think I'm going to get rid of everything I don't want anymore. I'm going to go clean out my room and check back for messages here in an hour. I don't expect a response at all because this is just a cliche vent, but if you've made it this far, thanks.







******Edit:****** Holy shit, I was not expecting this big of a response. I love you all. This has been beyond amazing. So many people have said this is the first time they've ever been truly able to relate to something, and that just goes to show that we're all a little more similar than I thought.



I'm trying really hard to respond to everyone but it's taking forever to get through everything! Just know I appreciate and read every single comment and message and I am trying to get to everyone. 



To everyone feeling similar to me, stay strong, we can do this, and message me if you need anyone to talk to.

To all the advice-givers and comforting people, thank you. You have affected me more than you can ever know.



Also, for some reason, I feel like a lot of people are assuming I am a man. I am not a man. This does not matter, I just thought it was odd.



Thanks, and I love you all a bunch!

A year ago, I was sitting in the middle of class and just up and decided I wanted to be dead, so I got on the next bus to the train station. A man saw me crying and sat next to me and asked me what was wrong, I told him what I was going to do because, well who gives a shit? He sat there and talked to me the whole bus ride and convinced me to stay with him until we got to the hospital (the bus route that goes to the train station also happened to go to the hospital as well) and he took me to the desk and told the administration women what I was planning to do. That was when I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a week later I started on medication. 



I started on 30mg of Lovan, and have since moved up to 50mg of Mirtazapine (daily). It was not easy and there were many, many setbacks. After multiple breakdowns (me just going absolutely psychotic/trying to hurt myself) and 2 legitimate suicide attempts (as in, I planned them for days before) I was hospitalized for about a week and a half, held in a psych ward. I have been seeing a psychologist regularly for all of this time. 



I know I'm young and I understand that the battle is not yet completely over, but I feel proud in what I have accomplished in the last 12 months. I've gone from barely functioning to loving life and pulled up my grades in such a short time, and it is because of the hard work that **I** put in, as well as my huge support network. 



**edit** holy shit what is with the downvote parade in here? I appreciate every single one of these comments, yet many of them are in the negatives, for no apparent reason! I understand that reddiquette stresses to downvote comments that don't add anything to the discussion, but I think its a little bit different in a depression-related subreddit, where compassion and kind words are equally as important as thought-provoking discussion. Thank you to all those that have commented and sorry to those that are in negatives.

I'm taking my medication and I'm fairly stable right now but I still low-key want to die. I never act on it, but when I go to do something simple and common-place like cross the street, I always wish that I'd get hit by a bus. The fact that I'd be ruining some poor driver's life doesn't bother me. I just lowkey want to be put out of my misery.



I had to use a knife this morning to cut my pizza, and I thought about cutting my wrists. Not in an abstract way, but a logical one. I thought about how cutting vertically on the vein will make it harder to repair and make it bleed more. I even put the knife against my skin for just a minute to feel it's sharpness.



I'm stable. I'd never go through with it. But I'm still planning my suicide like it still matters. Does anyone else do this?

This is a continuation from my last post



https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/40wspi/every_time_i_break_up_with_her_i_get_attacked_and/



However, this time, I broke up with her, and nothing bad happened. Although she cried and didn't let me get a word in or let me leave, I just stood up and left. I'm so fucking proud of doing that.  I feel so free, unchained, and happy. This is the best I've felt in months. Albeit I'm happy that I'm out of the relationship with her but I do feel alone and unloved because now I have nobody to look towards when I crave romantic affection, which is pretty often. I'm just glad that I'm out of that relationship, whether I feel lonely or not.
